PREFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION


In the present issue of this work such errors and misprints as the
writer or others have noted in earlier editions are corrected, while
the supplement has been extended sixty-five pages by the insertion
of thirteen hundred and twenty names in excess of those included in
the fourth edition. Wherever needful the entries in this portion of
the volume have been materially amplified, and this has occurred in
numerous instances, while throughout the book there have been supplied
many dates of deaths happening since the first issue of the Dictionary,
in 1897. Since that year the work has been enlarged to the extent of
one hundred and forty-six pages of addenda in all, and though it still
falls much short of perfection in its line, the writer trusts that it
will yet be found responsive to all reasonable requirements that may be
made upon it.

PREFACE.


The present volume is an outgrowth of the writer’s “Handbook of
American Authors,” first published in 1884, several features which
the judgment of the public approved in the earlier work having been
retained in this. Without pretending to contain an exhaustive list of
American writers, it may nevertheless lay claim to be fairly inclusive,
as the more than six thousand names herein mentioned will serve to
show. A few names that might naturally be looked for here have been
omitted at the request of their owners; while some others have not been
included, for the reason that diligent search failed to discover any
trustworthy data concerning them. Here and there, too, the reader may
chance upon unfilled dates of birth, or initials unexpanded. Yet in
the majority of such cases application by letter made directly to the
owners of the names aforesaid, or to relatives and immediate friends of
such persons, has failed to elicit any response. All reasonable effort
has been made to obtain trustworthy information upon such points,
but failure to obtain replies to letters of inquiry must account for
the greater number of such omissions; and here it may not be out of
place to mention that information of more general character obtained
from private sources has now and then been received too late to be
of service, owing to the fact that the work was already electrotyped
before it came to hand.

In a comprehensive work like this, including so large a number of
names and so many thousand dates, errors must of necessity occur, and
the author cannot hope to escape adverse criticism in this respect.
While absolute accuracy would have been impossible to attain, he has
nevertheless taken no little pains to approach this ideal; and to
this end, besides resorting to the ordinary means of information,
he has consulted hundreds of catalogues of libraries, colleges, and
publishers, as well as denominational year-books, and in numberless
instances has availed himself of trustworthy information received
directly from private sources. It thus happens that in certain cases
dates given in this volume differ from those in other works of
reference, and where this occurs the reason for the adoption of a
different date herein is supported by excellent authority.

It has been thought advisable to retain the “u” in the spelling of
such words as “colour,” “favour,” and the like, the exceptions to
this occurring in titles where the spelling of the original has been
followed. In connection with this it may not be amiss to note that
the original spelling of titles has been very commonly though not
invariably retained. To have done this in every instance, however,
would have entailed more labour than it was desirable to incur.

For several reasons the author has thought best in his classification
of certain authors to discriminate between poets and verse-writers. To
apply the name of poet to each and every writer of verse would have
been manifestly unjust. The poets of a generation are not numerous, but
the verse-writers are very many. If the term “poet” be loosely applied
it loses its signification, while to deny that name to many a writer of
excellent verse is to do him no injustice, but rather a service, as it
is no disparagement to a private soldier not to be addressed as colonel.

To the many persons who have so cordially responded to his letters
of inquiry, and whom he may not thank by name, the writer desires in
this place to express his acknowledgments. To Mr. Arthur Mason Knapp,
the superintendent of the Bates Hall department of the Boston Public
Library, he has been indebted for very much in the way of help and
suggestion from the time the work was begun, and to other officials of
that department he is under obligations likewise. He also gratefully
acknowledges much timely assistance received from the publishing firms
of Lee & Shepard, T. Y. Crowell & Co., and Lamson, Wolffe & Co. In the
reading of the proofs many valuable suggestions have been received
from the proof-readers at the Riverside Press; but his especial thanks
are due his friend, Mr. Francis H. Allen, of Boston, whose watchful,
critical supervision has been exercised upon every page of proof from
first to last. The debt of gratitude which the writer owes him for this
service may not be lightly estimated. Without his help, the book would
have fallen far short of whatever measure of excellence it may now be
judged to attain.

other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
