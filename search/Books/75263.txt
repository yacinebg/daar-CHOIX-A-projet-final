PREFACE.


There is something in the very name of FRIEND that quickens the pulse and
warms the heart. The most beautiful relationship in human intercourse
is friendship, and it is at once the easiest and most difficult of
attainment. In friendship’s name much is endured, much attempted and many
sacrifices are made, and the greatest happiness is gained. Friends may
come and go with the passing years, but the sweet memory of friendship’s
happy hour remains.




Deliberate long before thou consecrate a friend; and when thy impartial
judgment concludes him worthy of thy bosom, receive him joyfully and
entertain him wisely; impart thy secrets boldly, and mingle thy thought
with his; he is thy very self; and use him so. If thou firmly believe him
faithful, thou makest him so.

                                                                 —Quarles.

In the hours of distress and misery, the eyes of every mortal turn to
friendship. In the hour of gladness and conviviality, what is your want?
It is friendship. When the heart overflows with gratitude, or with any
other sweet and sacred sentiment, what is the word to which it would give
utterance? A Friend.

                                                                  —Landor.

A man’s best female friend is a wife of good sense and good heart, whom
he loves, and who loves him. If he have that, he need not seek elsewhere.
But supposing the man be without such a helpmate, female friendship he
must have, or his intellect will be without a garden, and there will be
many an unheeded gap even in its strongest fence.

                                                                  —Lytton.

After friendship it is confidence; before friendship it is judgment.

                                                                  —Seneca.

       *       *       *       *       *

A friend is a person before whom I may be sincere. Before him I may think
aloud.

                                                                 —Emerson.

       *       *       *       *       *

A faithful friend is the true image of the Deity.

                                                                —Napoleon.

       *       *       *       *       *

A friend cannot be known in prosperity, and an enemy cannot be hidden in
adversity.

True friends visit us in prosperity only when invited, but in adversity
they come without invitation.

       *       *       *       *       *

A friend may be often found and lost, but an old friend can never be
found, and nature has provided that he cannot be easily lost.

                                                                  —Jonson.

       *       *       *       *       *

A friend is he who sets his heart upon us, is happy with us, and delights
in us; and does for us what we want, is willing and fully engaged to do
all he can for us, on whom we can rely in all cases.

                                                                —Channing.

       *       *       *       *       *

A friendship will be young after the lapse of half a century; a passion
is old at the end of three months.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Ah, were I sever’d from thy side,
    Where were thy friend, and who my guide?
    Years have not seen—Time shall not see
    The hour that tears my soul from thee.

                                                                  —Byron.

       *       *       *       *       *

Although a friend may remain faithful in misfortune, yet none but the
very best and loftiest will remain faithful to us after our errors and
our sins.

                                                                  —Farrar.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship is the greatest bond in the world.

                                                                  —Taylor.

       *       *       *       *       *

A man should not repudiate the friendship of a woman because it may lead
to harm; he should cherish the friendship and beware of the harm.

                                                                   —Alger.

       *       *       *       *       *

A man’s reputation is what his friends say about him. His character is
what his enemies say about him.

                                                                 —Unknown.

       *       *       *       *       *

A slender acquaintance with the world must convince every man that
actions, not words, are the true criterion of the attachment of friends,
and that the most liberal profession of good will is very far from being
the surest mark of it.

                                                              —Washington.

       *       *       *       *       *

A woman, if she really be your friend, will have a sensitive regard
for your character, honor, repute. She will seldom counsel you to do a
shabby thing, for a woman friend desires to be proud of you. At the same
time her constitutional timidity makes her more cautious than your male
friend. She therefore seldom counsels you to do an imprudent thing.

                                                                  —Lytton.

       *       *       *       *       *

A true test of friendship: to sit or walk with a friend for an hour in
perfect silence without wearying of one another’s company.

                                                                  —Mulock.

       *       *       *       *       *

Always leave my friend something more to be desired of me. Be useful to
my friend, as far as he permits, and no further. Be much occupied with
my own affairs, and little, very little, with those of my friend. Leave
my friend always at liberty to think and act for himself, especially in
matters of little importance.

                                                               —Gold Dust.

       *       *       *       *       *

    And thou, my friend, whose gentle love
      Yet thrills my bosom’s chords,
    How much thy friendship was above
      Description’s power of words!

                                                                  —Byron.

       *       *       *       *       *

    As o’er the glacier’s frozen sheet
      Breathes soft the Alpine rose,
    So, through life’s desert springing sweet,
      The flower of friendship grows.

                                                                 —Holmes.

       *       *       *       *       *

    A faithful friend, best boon of Heaven,
    Unto some favored mortal given;
    Though still the same, yet varying still,
    Our each successive wants to fill,
    Whatever form his presence wears
    That presence every form endears.

                                                               —Williams.

       *       *       *       *       *

As people grow older friends and associates of youth are apt to be more
appreciated, and old relations are oftentimes resumed that have been
suffered to languish for many years.

These links with the past form a chain that, next to the ties of blood,
forms one of the strongest relations of social life.

Although pessimists declare that friendship is a myth and what are called
intimates are people who consort together for amusement or self-interest,
the very fact that there is this feeling of especial kindness for
old time associates proves that there is such a thing as sentiment
independent of worldly considerations.

                                                                 —Unknown.

Every friend is to the other a sun and a sunflower also. He attracts and
follows.

    I want a warm and faithful friend,
      To cheer the adverse hour;
    Who ne’er to flatter will descend,
      Nor bend the knee to power.
    A friend to chide me when I’m wrong,
      My inmost soul to see;
    And that my friendship prove as strong
      To him as his to me.

                                                                  —Adams.

       *       *       *       *       *

Friendship is an allay of our sorrows, the ease of our passions, the
discharge of our oppressions, the sanctuary to our calamities, the
counsellor of our doubts, the charity of our minds, the emission of our
thoughts, the exercise and improvement of what we meditate.

                                                                  —Taylor.

       *       *       *       *       *

Beware lest thy friend learn to tolerate one frailty of thine, and so an
obstacle be raised to the progress of thy love.

                                                                 —Thoreau.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is not becoming to turn from friends in adversity, but then it is for
those who have basked in the sunshine of their prosperity to adhere to
them. No one was ever so foolish as to select the unfortunate for their
friends.

                                                                 —Lucanus.

       *       *       *       *       *

Consult your friend on all things, especially on those which concern
yourself; his counsel may then be useful, where your own self-love might
impair your judgment.

                                                                  —Seneca.

    Constant and solid, whom no storms can shake,
    Nor death unfix, a right friend ought to be;
    And if condemned to survive, doth make
    No second choice, but grief and memory.
    But friendship’s best fate is, when it can spend
    A life, a fortune, all to serve a friend.

Dear to me is a friend, yet I can also make use of an enemy; the friend

Don’t flatter yourself that friendship authorizes you to say disagreeable
things to your intimates. The nearer you come into relation with a
person, the more necessary do tact and courtesy become. Except in cases
of necessity, which are rare, leave your friend to learn unpleasant
things from his enemies; they are ready enough to tell them.

Friendship maketh indeed a fair day in the affections from storm and
tempests, but it maketh daylight in the understanding out of darkness and
confusion of thoughts.

Friendship is to be valued for what there is in it, not what can be
gotten out of it. When two people appreciate each other because each
has found the other convenient to have around, they are not friends,
they are simply acquaintances with a business understanding. To seek
friendship for its utility is as futile as to seek the end of a rainbow
for its bag of gold. A true friend is always useful in the highest sense;
but we should beware of thinking of our friends as brother members of a
mutual benefit association, with its periodical demands and threats of
suspension for non-payment of dues.

Friendship, like love, is destroyed by long absence, though it may be
increased by short intermissions. What we have missed long enough to want
it we value more when it is regained; but that which has been lost until
it is forgotten will be found at last with little gladness, and with
still less if a substitute has supplied the place.

Far from the eyes, far from the heart, say the vulgar. Believe nothing

presence, the more the desire of that pleasure burns in the soul of your
friend.

New friends can never take the same place in our lives as the old. The
former may be better liked for the time, their society may even have
more attractions, but in a way they are strangers. If through change of
circumstances they go out of our lives, they go out of it altogether.
These latter-day friendships have no root, as it were. Their growth is
as Jonah’s gourd—overshadowing, perhaps, and expansive, but all on the
surface; whereas an old friend remains an old friend forever. Although
separated for an indefinite period and not seen for years, if a chance
happening brings old comrades together they resume the old relations in
the most natural manner, and take up the former lines as easily as if
there had been no break or interruption of the intermediate intercourse
of auld lang syne.

Truthfulness, frankness, disinterestedness, and faithfulness are the
qualities absolutely essential to friendship, and these must be crowned

Of all felicities, the most charming is that of a firm and gentle
friendship. It sweetens all our cares, dispels our sorrows, and counsels
us in all extremities. Nay, if there were no other comfort in it than
the bare exercise of so generous a virtue, even for that single reason
a man would not be without it; it is a sovereign antidote against all
calamities—even against the fear of death itself.

The most powerful and the most lasting friendships are usually those of
the early season of our lives, when we are most susceptible of warm and
affectionate impressions. The connections into which we enter in any
after-period decrease in strength as our passions abate in heat; and
there is not, I believe, a single instance of vigorous friendship that
ever struck root in a bosom chilled by years.

The tide of friendship does not rise high on the banks of perfection.
Amiable weaknesses and shortcomings are the food of love. It is from the
roughness and imperfect breaks in a man that you are able to lay hold
of him. My friend is not perfect—no more am I—and so we suit each other
admirably.

There are two elements that go to the composition of friendship, each
so sovereign that I can detect no superiority in either, no reason why
either should be first named. One is Truth. A friend is a person with
whom I may be sincere. Before him I may think aloud. I am arrived at
last in the presence of a man so real and equal that I may drop even
those undermost garments of dissimulation, courtesy, and second thought,
which men never put off, and may deal with him with the simplicity and
wholeness with which one chemical atom meets another. Sincerity is the
luxury allowed, like diadems and authority, only to the highest rank,
that being permitted to speak truth as having none above it to court or
conform unto.

Every man alone is sincere. The other element of friendship is tenderness.

What we usually call friends are only acquaintances and familiarities
brought together through some particular occasion or use, by which some
little intercourse exists between our souls; but in the friendship of
which I speak they are so tightly joined together one to the other, in so
universal a mixture, that it effaces all signs of the seam by which they
were first joined.

There are many moments in friendship, as in love, when silence is beyond
words. The faults of our friend may be clear to us, but it is well to
seem to shut our eyes to them. Friendship is usually treated by the
majority of mankind as a tough and everlasting thing which will survive
all manner of bad treatment. But this is an exceedingly great and foolish
error; it may die in an hour of a single unwise word; its condition of
existence is that it should be dealt with delicately and tenderly, being
as it is a sensitive plant and not a roadside thistle. We must not expect
our friend to be above humanity.

There is no such certain evidence of friendship as never to overlook
the sins and failings of our brethren. Hast thou seen them at enmity?
Reconcile them. Hast thou seen them set on unlawful gain? Check them.
Hast thou seen them wronged? Stand up in their defense. It is not on
them but on thyself thou art conferring the chief benefit. It is for
this purpose that we are friends—that we may be of good service to
one another. A man will listen in a different spirit to a friend. An
indifferent person he will regard perhaps with suspicion, and so in like
manner an instructor, but not so a true friend.

The end of friendship is a commerce the most strict and homely that can
be joined; more strict than any of which we have experience. It is for
aid and comfort through all the relations and passages of life and death.
It is fit for serene days, and graceful gifts, and country rambles, but
also for rough roads and hard fare, ship-wreck, poverty, and persecution.
It keeps company with the sallies of wit and the trances of religion. We
are to dignify to each other the daily needs and offices of man’s life,
and embellish it by courage, wisdom and unity. It should never fall into
something usual and settled, but should be alert and inventive and add
rhyme and reason to what was drudgery.

    A friendship as had mastered time:

    Each year to ancient friendships adds a ring,

    Their unbought ring of shelter or of shade.

    Friendship, a dear balm—
    Whose coming is as light and music are

    A smile among dark frowns; a beloved light;
    A solitude, a refuge, a delight.

Nothing delights the mind so much as true and sweet friendship. What a
blessing it is when there are hearts prepared for you in which every
secret rests securely, whose knowledge you fear less than your own, whose
conversation calms your anxieties, whose opinion aids your plan, whose
mirth dispels your sorrow, and whose very sight delights you.

    Much beautiful and excellent and fair

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
