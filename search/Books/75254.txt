_May it please Your Grace_,

I may justly put these LECTURES under your Graces Patronage, their
Publication being wholly owing to You: For having the Honour to be a
Member of the ROYAL SOCIETY, as well as a _Divine_, I was minded to try
what I could do towards the Improvement of _Philosophical_ Matters to
_Theological_ Uses; and accordingly laid a Scheme of what I have here
published a Part of, and when I had little else to do, I drew up what
I had to say, making it rather the diverting Exercises of my _Leisure
Hours_, than more serious _Theological Studies_. This Work, (although
I made a considerable Progress in it at first, whilst a Novelty, yet)
having no Thoughts of Publishing, I laid aside, until your Grace,
being informed of my Design by some of my Learned Friends, both of the
Clergy and Laity, was pleased to call me to the unexpected Honour of
Preaching Mr. _Boyle_’s LECTURES: An Honour I was little aware of in my
Country-Privacy, and not much acquainted with Persons in high Stations,
and not at all, particularly, with your Grace. So that therefore as it
pleased your Grace, not only to confer an unsought profitable Honour upon
me (a Stranger) but also to continue it for Two Years, out of Your good
Opinion of my Performance, in some measure, answering Mr. _Boyle_’s End;
so I can do no less than make this publick, grateful Acknowledgment of
your Grace’s great and unexpected Favour.

But it is not my self alone; but the whole LECTURE also is beholden to
your _Grace_’s kind and pious Endeavours. It was You that encouraged this
noble Charity, and assisted in the Settlement of it, in the Honourable
_Founder_’s Life-time; and since his Death, it was You that procured a
more certain Salary for the LECTURERS, paid more constantly and duly
than it was before[a].

These Benefits as I my self have been a Sharer of, so I should be very
ungrateful should I not duly acknowledge, and repay with my repeated
Thanks and good Wishes And that the infinite Rewarder of well-doing may
give Your _Grace_ a plentiful Reward of these, and Your many other, both
Publick and Private Benefactions, is the hearty Wish of,

                              _Your GRACE’s
                         Most Humble and Thankful
                            Son and Servant_,

FOOTNOTES:

[a] It may not only gratify the Reader’s Curiosity, but also be of Use
for preventing Encroachments in Time to come, to give the following
Account of Mr. _Boyle_’s Lectures.

Mr. _Boyle_, by a Codicil, dated _July 28. 1691._ and annexed to
his Will, charged his Messuage or Dwelling-House in St. _Michael_’s
_Crooked-Lane, London_, with the Payment of the clear Yearly Rents and
Profits thereof, to some Learned Divine in _London_, or within the Bills
of Mortality, to be Elected for a Term not exceeding Three Years, by his
Grace the present _Lord Archbishop_ of _Canterbury_ (then Dr. _Tenison_),
Sir _Henry Ashurst_, Sir _John Rotheram_, and _John Evelyn_, Esq; The
Business he appointed those Lectures for, was, among others, _to be
ready to satisfie real Scruples, and to answer such new Objections and
Difficulties, as might be started: to which good Answers had not been
made_. And also, _To Preach Eight Sermons in the Year, the first ~Monday~
of ~January~, ~February~, ~March~, ~April~ and ~May~, and of ~September~,
~October~ and ~November~._ The Subject of these Sermons was to be, _The
Proof of the Christian Religion against notorious Infidels, ~viz.~
Atheists, Theists, Pagans, Jews, and Mahometans, not descending lower to
any Controversies that are among Christians themselves_. But by Reason
the Lecturers were seldom continued above a Year, and that the House
sometimes stood empty, and Tenants brake, or failed in due Payment of
their Rent, therefore the Salary sometimes remained long unpaid, or could
not be gotten without some Difficulty: To remedy which Inconvenience, his
present _Grace_ of _Canterbury_ procured a Yearly Stipend of 50_l._ to be
paid Quarterly for ever, charged upon a Farm in the Parish of _Brill_, in
the County of _Bucks_: Which Stipend is accordingly very duly paid when
demanded, without Fee or Reward.

TO THE READER.


[Sidenote: _Vid. Bp. ~Burnet~’s Funeral Serm. p. 24._]

_As the noble ~Founder~ of the LECTURES I have had the Honour of
Preaching, was a great Improver ~of Natural Knowledge~, so, in all
Probability, he did it out of a pious End, as well as in Pursuit of his
~Genius~. For it was his settled Opinion, that nothing tended more to
cultivate true Religion and Piety in a Man’s Mind, than a thorough Skill
in Philosophy. And such Effect it manifestly had in him, as is evident
from divers of his published Pieces; from his constant Deportment in
~never mentioning the Name of GOD without a Pause, and visible Stop in
his Discourse~; and from the noble Foundation of his Lectures for the
Honour of GOD, and the generous Stipend he allowed for the same._

[Sidenote: _Vid. Mr. ~Boyle~’s Will._]

_And forasmuch as his Lectures were appointed by him for the ~Proof of
the Christian Religion against Atheists and other notorious Infidels~,
I thought, when I had the Honour to be made his Lecturer, that I could
not better come up to his Intent, than to attempt a Demonstration of
the ~Being~ and ~Attributes of GOD~, in what I may call Mr. ~Boyle~’s
own, that is a ~Physico-Theological~, Way. And, besides that it was
for this very Service that I was called to this Honour, I was the
more induced to follow this Method, by reason none of my learned and
ingenious Predecessors in these Lectures, have done it on purpose, but
only casually, in a transient, piece-meal manner; they having made it
their Business to prove the great Points of Christianity in another
Way, which they have accordingly admirably done. But considering what
our ~Honourable Founder~’s Opinion was of ~Natural Knowledge~, and that
his Intent was, that those Matters by passing through divers Hands, and
by being treated of in different Methods, should take in most of what
could be said upon the Subject, I hope my Performance may be acceptable,
although one of the meanest._

_As for others, who have before me done something of this kind; as
~Mersenne~ on ~Genesis~; Dr. ~Cockburne~ in his ~Essays~; Mr. ~Ray~
in his ~Wisdom of God~, &c. and I may add the first of Mr. ~Boyle~’s
~Lecturers~, the most learned Dr. ~Bently~ in his ~Boyle~’s ~Lectures~,
the eloquent Arch-Bishop of ~Cambray~, (and I hear, the ingenious Mons.
~Perault~ hath something of this kind, but never saw it:) I say, as to
these learned and ingenious Authors, as the Creation is an ample Subject,
so I industriously endeavour’d to avoid doing over what they before had
done; and for that Reason did not, for many Years, read their Books until
I had finish’d my own. But when I came to compare what each of us had
done, I found my self in many Things to have been anticipated by some or
other of them, especially by my Friend, the late great Mr. ~Ray~. And
therefore in some Places I shorten’d my Discourse, and referr’d to them;
and in a few others, where the Thread of my Discourse would have been
interrupted, I have made use of their Authority, as the best Judges; as
of Mr. ~Ray~’s, for Instance, with Relation to the Mountains and their
Plants, and other Products. If then the Reader should meet with any
Thing mention’d before by others, and not accordingly acknowledged by
me, I hope he will candidly think me no Plagiary, because I can assure
him I have along, (where I was aware of it,) cited my Authors with their
due Praise. And it is scarce possible, when Men write on the same, or
a Subject near a-kin, and the Observations are obvious, but that they
must often hit upon the same Thing: And frequently this may happen from
Persons making Observations about one, and the same Thing, without
knowing what each other hath done; which indeed, when the first Edition
of my Book was nearly printed off, I found to be my own Case, having
(for want of Dr. ~Hook~’s ~Micrography~ being at hand, it being a very
scarce Book, and many Years since I read it,) given Descriptions of two
or three Things, which I thought had not been tolerably well observ’d
before, but are describ’d well by that curious Gentleman._

_One is a ~Feather~, the Mechanism of which we in the main agree in,
except in his Representation in ~Fig. 1. Scheme 22.~ which is somewhat
different from what I have represented in my ~Fig. 18, &c.~ But I can
stand by the Truth, though not the Elegance of my Figures. But as to
the other Differences, they are accidental, occasion’d by our taking
the Parts in a different View, or in a different Part of a Vane; and
to say the Truth, (not flattering my self, or detracting from the
admirable Observations of that great Man,) I have hit upon a few Things
that escap’d him, being enabled to do so, not only by the Help of such
Microscopes as he made use of; but also by those made by Mr. ~Wilson~,
which exceed all I ever saw, whether of ~English~, ~Dutch~, or ~Italian~
make; several of which Sorts I have seen and examined._

_The other Thing we have both of us figur’d and describ’d, is, ~The
Sting of a Bee or Wasp~; in which we differ more than in the last.
But by a careful Re-examination, I find, that although Dr. ~Hook~’s
Observations are more critical than any were before, yet they are not so
true as mine. For as to the ~Scabbard~, (as he calls it,) I could never
discover any Beards thereon; and I dare be confident there are none, but
what are on the two Spears. And as to the Point of the ~Scabbard~, he
hath represented it as tubular, or bluntish at the Top; but it really
terminates in a sharp Point, and the two Spears and the Poyson come out
at a Slit, or longish Hole, a little below the Top or Point. And as to
the Spears, he makes them to be but one, and that the Point thereof lies
always out of the Scabbard. But by a strict Examination, they will be
found to be two, as I have said, and that they always lie within the
Scabbard, except in stinging; as I have represented them, in ~Fig. 21.~
from the transparent Sting of a Wasp. And as to the Spear being made of
Joynts, and parted into two, as his ~Fig. 2. Scheme 16.~ represents, I
could never upon a Review, discover it to be so, but imagine, that by
seeing the Beards lying upon, or behind the Spears, he might take them
for Joynts, and by seeing the Point of one Spear lie before the other, he
might think the Spear was parted in two. But lest the Reader should think
himself imposed upon both by Dr. ~Hook~ and my ~Self~, it is necessary
to be observ’d, that the ~Beards~ (or ~Tenterhooks~ as Dr. ~Hook~ calls
them) lie only on one Side of each Spear, not all round them; and are
therefore not to be seen, unless they are laid in a due Posture in the
Microscope, ~viz.~ sideways, not under, or atop the Spear._

_The last Thing (which scarce deserves mention) is the Mechanism of the
~Hair~, which Dr. ~Hook~ found to be solid, like a long Piece of Horn,
not hollow, as ~Malpighi~ found it in some Animals. And I have found
both those great Men to be in some Measure in the Right, the Hair of
some Animals, or in some Parts of the Body being very little, if at all
tubular; and in others, particularly ~Mice~, ~Rats~ and ~Cats~, to be as
I have represented in my ~Fig. 14.~ &c._

_And now if my Inadvertency in other Things hath no worse Effect than
it hath had in these, namely, to confirm, correct, or clear others
Observations, I hope the Reader will excuse it, if he meets with any
more of the like kind. But not being conscious of any such Thing
(although probably there may be many such) I am more sollicitous to
beg the Reader’s Candour and Favour, with Relation both to the ~Text~
and ~Notes~: In the former of which, I fear he will think I have much
under-done, as in the latter over-done the Matter: But for my Excuse,
I desire it may be consider’d, that the textual Part being Sermons, to
be deliver’d in the Pulpit, it was necessary to insist but briefly upon
many of the Works of GOD, and to leave out many Things that might have
been admitted in a more free Discourse. So that I wish it may not be
thought I have said too much rather than too little for such an Occasion
and Place. And indeed, I had no small Trouble in expunging some Things,
altering many, and softening the most, and, in a word, giving in some
measure the Whole a different Dress than what I had at first drawn it up
in, and what it now appears in._

_And as for the ~Notes~, which may be thought too large, I confess I
might have shorten’d them, and had Thoughts of doing it, by casting some
of them into the Text, as an ingenious, learned Friend advis’d. But when
I began to do this, I found it was in a Manner to new-make all, and
that I should be necessitated to transcribe the greatest Part of the
Book, which (having no Assistant) would have been too tedious for me,
being pretty well fatigu’d with it before. I then thought it best to
pare off from some, and to leave out others, and accordingly did so in
many Places, and would have done it in more, particularly, in many of
the ~Citations~ out of the ~Ancients~, both ~Poets~ and others, as also
in many of the ~anatomical Observations~, and many of my own and others
Observations: But then I consider’d as to the First, that those Citations
do (many of them at least) shew the Sense of Mankind about God’s Works,
and that the most of them may be acceptable to young Gentlemen at the
Universities, for whose Service these Lectures are greatly intended.
And as to the anatomical Notes, and some others of the like Nature,
most of them serve either to the Confirmation, or the Illustration, or
Explication of the Text, if not to the learned, yet to the unskilful,
less learned Reader; for whose sake, if I had added more, I believe he
would forgive me. And lastly, as to the Observations of my self and some
others, where it happens that they are long, it is commonly where a
Necessity lay upon me of fully expressing the Author’s Sense, or my own,
or where the Thing was new, and never before Publish’d; in which Case, it
was necessary to be more Express and Particular, than in Matters better
known, or where the Author may be referr’d unto._

_In the former Editions I promised ~another Part I~ Had ~relating to
the Heavens~, if I was thereunto encouraged. And two large Impressions
of this Book, having been sold off, so as to admit of a Third before
the Year was gone about; and hearing that it is translated into two, if
not three Languages; but especially being importuned by divers learned
Persons, both known and unknown, I have thought my self sufficiently
engaged to perform that Promise; and have accordingly published that
Part._

_So that I have now carry’d my ~Survey~ through most Parts of the visible
Creation, except the ~Waters~, which are for the most Part omitted; and
the ~Vegetables~, which, for want of Time, I was forced to treat of in a
perfunctory Manner. And to the Undertaking of the former of these, having
receiv’d divers Sollicitations from Persons unknown as well as known,
I think my self bound in Civility to own their Favour, and to return
them my hearty Thanks for the kind Opinion they have shewn of my other
Performances, that they have encourag’d me to undertake this other Task.
And accordingly I have begun it, and (as far as my Affairs will permit)
have made some Progress in it: But Age and Avocations growing upon me,
I begin to fear I shall scarce be able to finish it as I would, and
therefore must recommend that ample and noble Subject to others, who have
more leisure, and would do it better than I._

_As to ~Additions~, I have been much sollicited thereto by divers curious
and learned Persons, who would have had me to insert some of their
Observations, and many more of my own: But in a Work of this Nature, this
would have been endless; and although the Book would thereby be render’d
much better, and more compleat, yet I could by no Means excuse so great
an Injustice to the Purchasers of the former Editions. And therefore
(except in the second Edition, where it was not easy to be avoided) few
Additions or Alterations have been made, besides what were Typographical,
or of small Consideration. Only in the third Edition I amended the first
Paragraph of ~Note (a). Chap. 5. Book 1.~ concerning ~Gravity~; and in
the Fourth, ~Page 16.~ and ~18.~ I inserted two Passages out of ~Seneca~,
that were inadvertently left out, and corrected many Things, that upon a
careful Review, seem’d to want amendment._

_And lastly, as to the following ~Analysis~, it was added at the Request
of some of my learned and ingenious Friends; and although it might have
been contracted, they would not suffer it to be so._

    III. The Motion of Animals: Concerning which I consider
             Transiently the
        Muscles, and their Structure, their Size, Fastening to the
            Joynts, Motions, _&c._                                    158.

      Swift or slow, with Wings, Legs many or few, or none at all,
          according to the various Occasions and Ways of Animals
          Lives. As particularly in
        Reptiles, whose Food and Habitation is near at hand.
        Man and Quadrupeds, whose Occasions require a larger Range,
            and therefore a swifter Motion                            164.
        Birds, and Insects, whose Food, Habitation and Safety
            require yet a larger Range, and have accordingly a yet
            swifter Motion and direct Conveyance.
      Geometrically and neatly performed by the nicest Rules.
      Well provided for by the
        Due Equipoise of the Body                                     165.
        Motive Parts being accurately placed with regard to the

            due Proportion of Weight and Exercise.
    IV. The _Place_ allotted to the several Tribes of Animals to
            live and act in. Concerning which I observe that
      Their Organs are adapted to their Place                         167.
      All Places habitable are duly stocked.
      Various Animals have their various Places; and the Wisdom
          thereof                                                     168.

        Length of their Life                                          169.

            Providence appears in the                                 179.
      Maintaining such large Numbers of all kinds of Animals on
          the Land, in the Seas, and divers Places too unlikely
          to afford sufficient Food.
      Adjustment of the Quantity of Food to the Number of Devourers,
          so that
        There is not too much, so as to rot, and annoy the World      181.
        The most useful is most plentiful, and easiest propagated   _ibid._
      Delight which the various Tribes of Animals have to the
          Varieties of Food, so that what is grateful to one, is
          nauseous to another: Which is a wise means to cause
        All Creatures to be sufficiently supplied.
        All sorts of Food to be consumed.
        The World to be kept sweet and clean by those means           183.
      Peculiar Food, that particular Places afford to the Creatures
          residing therein                                            184.

_INTRODUCTION._


In _Psal._ cxi. 2. The Psalmist asserts, That _the[a] Works of the Lord
are great; sought out of all them that have Pleasure therein_. This is
true of all _God’s Works_, particularly of his _Works of Creation_:
Which, when _sought out_, or, as the _Hebrew_ Word [b] signifieth, when
_heedfully_ and _deeply pried into, solicitously observ’d and enquir’d
out_, especially when clearly discovered to us; in this Case, I say, we
find those Works of GOD abundantly to deserve the Psalmist’s Character
of being _Great_ and Noble; inasmuch as they are made with the most
exquisite Art, [c] contrived with the utmost Sagacity, and ordered
with plain wise Design, and ministring to admirable Ends. For which
reason St. _Paul_ might well affirm of those Ποιήματα of God, [d] That
the _invisible Things of God, even his eternal Power and Godhead, are
understood by them_. And indeed they are the most easy, and intelligible
Demonstrations of the _Being_ and _Attributes_ of God;[e] especially
to such as are unacquainted with the Subtilties of Reasoning and
Argumentation; as the greatest part of Mankind are.

It may not therefore be unsuitable to the Nature and Design of
Lectures[f] founded by one of the greatest Vertuoso’s of the last Age,
and instituted too on purpose for the Proof of the Christian Religion
against Atheists and other Infidels, to improve this occasion in the
Demonstration of the _Being_ and _Attributes_ of an infinitely wise and
powerful Creator, from a Cursory Survey of the Works of _Creation_, or
(as often called) of _Nature_.

Which Works belong either to our _Terraqueous Globe_, or the _Heavens_.

I shall begin with our _own Globe_, being nearest, and falling most under
our Senses. Which being a Subject very various and copious, for the more
methodical and orderly proceeding upon it, I shall distribute the Works
therein:

I. Into such as are not properly Parts, but _Appendages_ or _Out-works_
of the Globe.

II. The _Globe_ it self.

CHAP. I.

_Of the Atmosphere in general._


The Atmosphere, or Mass of Air, Vapours and Clouds, which surrounds our
Globe, will appear to be a matter of Design, and the infinitely wise
Creator’s Work, if we consider its _Nature_ and _Make_[a], and its _Use_
to the World[b].

1. Its Nature and Make, a Mass of Air, of subtile penetrating Matter, fit
to pervade other Bodies, to penetrate into the inmost Recesses of Nature,
to excite, animate, and spiritualize; and in short, to be the very Soul
of this lower World. A thing consequently

2. Of greatest Use to the World, useful to the Life, the Health, the
Comfort, the Pleasure, and Business of the whole Globe. It is the Air
the whole Animal World breatheth, and liveth by; not only the Animals
inhabiting the Earth[c] and

Air[d], but those of the Waters[e] too. Without it most Animals live
scarce half a Minute[f]; and others, that are the most accustomed to the
want of it, live not without it many Days.

And not only Animals themselves, but even Trees and Plants, and the whole
vegetable Race, owe their Vegetation and Life to this useful Element;
as will appear when I come to speak of them, and is manifest from their
Glory and Verdure in a free Air, and their becoming Pale and Sickly, and
Languishing and Dying, when by any means excluded from it[g].

Thus useful, thus necessary, is the Air to the Life of the animated
Creatures; and no less is it to the Motion and Conveyance of many of
them. All the winged Tribes owe their Flight and Buoyancy[h] to it,
as shall be shewn in proper place: And even the watery Inhabitants
themselves cannot ascend and descend into their Element, well without
it[i].

But it would be tedious to descend too far into Particulars, to reckon
up the many Benefits of this noble Appendage of our Globe in many useful
Engines[k]; in many of the Functions and Operations of Nature[l] in the
Conveyance of Sounds; and a Thousand Things besides. And I shall but
just mention the admirable use of our Atmosphere in ministring to the
enlightening of the World, by its reflecting the Light of the heavenly
Bodies to us[m]; and refracting the Sun-beams to our Eye, before it
ever surmounteth our Horizon[n]; by which means the Day is protracted
throughout the whole Globe; and the long and dismal Nights are shorten’d
in the frigid Zones, and Day sooner approacheth them; yea the Sun itself
riseth in Appearance (when really it is absent from them) to the great
Comfort of those forlorn Places[o].

But passing by all these Things with only a bare mention, and wholly
omitting others that might have been named, I shall only insist upon the
excellent Use of this noble circumambient Companion of our Globe, in
respect of two of its Meteors, the Winds, and the Clouds and Rain[p].

terramque connectit, ~&c.~_ Senec. Nat. Qu. l. 2. c. 4.

[c] As the Air is of absolute Necessity to Animal Life, so it is
necessary that it should be of a due Temperament or Consistence; not
foul, by reason that suffocateth: not too rare and thin, because that
sufficeth not; with Examples of each of which, I shall a little entertain
the Reader. In one of Mr. _Hawksbee_’s Compressing Engines, I closely
shut up a _Sparrow_ without forcing any Air in; and in less than an Hour
the Bird began to pant, and be concerned; and in less than an Hour and
half to be sick, vomit, and more out of Breath; and in two Hours time was
nearly expiring.

Another I put in and compressed the Air, but the Engine leaking, I
frequently renewed the Compressure; by which means, (although the
Bird panted a little after the first Hour,) yet after such frequent
Compressures, and Immission of fresh Air, it was very little concerned,
and taken out seemingly unhurt after three Hours.

After this I made two other Experiments in compressed Air, with the
Weight of two Atmospheres injected, the Engine holding tight and well;
the one with the _Great Titmouse_, the other with a _Sparrow_. For near
an Hour they seemed but little concerned; but after that grew fainter,
and in two Hours time sick, and in three Hours time died. Another thing
I took notice of, was, that when the Birds were sick and very restless,
I fancied they were somewhat relieved for a short space, with the Motion
of the Air, caused by their fluttering and shaking their Wings, (a thing
worth trying in the _Diving-Bell_). I shall leave the ingenious Reader to
judge what the cause was of both the Birds living longer in compressed,
than uncompressed Air; whether a less quantity of Air was not sooner
fouled and rendred unfit for Respiration, than a greater.

From these Experiments two Things are manifested; one is, that Air,
in some measure compressed, or rather heavy, is necessary to Animal
Life: Of which by and by. The other, that fresh Air is also necessary:
For pent up Air, when overcharged with the Vapours emitted our of the
Animal’s Body, becomes unfit for Respiration. For which Reason, in the
_Diving-Bell_, after some time of stay under Water, they are forced to
come up and take in fresh Air, or by some such means recruit it. But
the famous _Cornelius Drebell_ contrived not only a Vessel to be rowed
under Water, but also a Liquor to be carried in that Vessel, that would
supply the want of fresh Air. The Vessel was made for King _James_ I.
It carried twelve Rowers, besides the Passengers. It was tried in the
River of _Thames_; and one of the Persons that was in that submarine
Navigation was then alive, and told it one, who related the Matter to
our famous Founder, the Honourable, and most Ingenious Mr. _Boyl_. As to
the Liquor, Mr. _Boyl_ saith, he discovered by a Doctor of Physick, who
married _Drebell_’s Daughter, that it was used from time to time when
the Air in the submarine Boat was clogged by the Breath of the Company,
and thereby made unfit for Respiration; at which time, by unstopping a
Vessel full of this Liquor, he could speedily restore to the troubled Air
such a proportion of vital Parts, as would make it again for a good while
fit for Respiration. The Secret of this Liquor _Drebell_ would never
disclose to above one Person, who himself assured Mr. _Boyl_ what it was.
_Vid._ _Boyl. Exp. Phys. Mech. of the Spring of the Air, Exp. 41._ in
the _Digres_. This Story I have related from Mr. _Boyl_, but at the same
time much question whether the Virtues of the Liquor were so effectual as
reported.

And as too gross, so too rare an Air is unfit for Respiration. Not to
mention the forced Rarefactions made by the Air-Pump, in the following
Note; it is found, that even the extraordinary natural Rarefactions, upon
the tops of very high Hills, much affect Respiration. An Ecclesiastical
Person, who had visited the high Mountains of _Armenia_, (on which some
fancy the Ark rested) told Mr. _Boyl_, that whilst he was on the upper
part of them, he was forced to fetch his Breath oftner than he was wont.
And taking notice of it when he came down, the People told him, that it
was what happen’d to them when they were so high above the Plane, and
that it was a common Observation among them. The like Observation the
same Ecclesiastick made upon the top of a Mountain in the _Cevennes_. So
a learned Traveller, and curious Person, on one of the highest Ridges
of the _Pyrenees_, call’d _Pic de Midi_, found the Air not so fit for
Respiration, as the common Air, but he and his Company were fain to
breath shorter and oftner than in the lower Air. _Vid._ _Phil. Transact._
No. 63, or _Lowthorp’s Abridg._ Vol. 2. p. 226.

Such another Relation the learned _Joseph Acosta_ gives of himself and
his Company, that, when they passed the high Mountains of _Peru_, which
they call _Periacaca_, (to which he saith, _the Alps themselves seemed
to them but as ordinary Houses, in regard of high Towers,) He and his
Companions were surprized with such extreme Pangs of Straining and
Vomiting, (not without casting up of Blood too,) and with so violent a
Distemper, that he concludes he should undoubtedly have died; but that
this lasted not above three or four Hours, before they came into a more
convenient and natural Temperature of the Air._ All which he concludes
proceeded from the too great Subtilty and Delicacy of the Air, which is
not proportionable to humane Respiration, which requires a more gross and
temperate Air, _Vid._ _Boyl_, _ubi supra_.

Thus it appears, that an Air too Subtile, Rare and Light, is unfit for
Respiration: But the Cause is not the Subtilty or too great Delicacy, as
Mr. Boyl thinks, but the too great Lightness thereof, which renders it
unable to be a Counterbalance, or an Antagonist to the Heart, and all the
Muscles ministring to _Respiration_, and the _Diastole_ of the Heart. Of
which see _Book 4. Chap. 7. Note 1._

And as our Inability to live in too rare and light an Air may discourage
those vain Attempts of Flying and Whimsies of passing to the Moon, &c.
so our being able to bear an heavier State of the Air is an excellent
Provision for Mens Occasions in Mines, and other great Depths of the
Earth; and those other greater Pressures made upon the Air, in the
_Diving-Bell_, when we descend into great Depths of the Waters.

[d] That the Inhabitants of the Air, (Birds and Insects,) need the Air
as well as Man and other Animals, is manifest from their speedy dying in
too feculent, or too much rarefied Air; of which see the preceding and
following _Note (f)._ But yet Birds and Insects (some Birds at least)
can live in a rarer Air than Man. Thus Eagles, Kites, Herons, and divers
other Birds, that delight in high Flights, are not affected with the
Rarity of the Medium, as those Persons were in the preceding Note. So
Insects bear the Air-Pump long, as in the following _Note (f)._

[e] Creatures inhabiting the Waters need the Air, as well as other
Animals, yea, and fresh Air too. The _Hydrocanthari_ of all Sorts, the
_Nymphæ_ of _Gnats_, and many other Water-Insects, have a singular
Faculty, and an admirable Apparatus, to raise their back Parts to the top
of the Waters, and take in fresh Air. It is pretty to see, for Instance,
the _Hydrocanthari_ come and thrust their Tails out of the Water, and
take in a Bubble of Air, at the tip of their _Vaginæ_ and Tails, and then
nimbly carry it down with them into the Waters; and, when that is spent,
or fouled, to ascend again and recruit it.

So Fishes also are well known to use Respiration, by passing the Water
through their Mouths and Gills. But _Carps_ will live out of the Water,
only in the Air; as is manifest by the Experiment of their way of Fatting
them in _Holland_, and which hath been practised herein _England_, _viz._
they hang them up in a Cellar, or some cool Place, in wet Moss in a small
Net, with their Heads out, and feed them with white Bread soaked in Milk
for many Days. This was told me by a Person very curious, and of great
Honour and Eminence, whose Word (if I had leave to name him) no Body
would question: And it being an Instance of the Respiration of Fishes
very singular, and somewhat out of the way, I have for the Reader’s
Diversion taken notice of it.

[f] By Experiments I made my self in the Air Pump, in _September_
and _October_, 1704; I observed that Animals whose Hearts have two
_Ventricles_, and no _Foramen Ovale_, as Birds, Dogs, Cats, Rats, Mice,
_&c._ die in less than half a Minute counting from the very first
Exsuction; especially in a small Receiver.

A _Mole_ (which I suspected might have born more than other Quadrupeds)
died in one Minute (without Recovery) in a large Receiver; and doubtless
would hardly have survived half a Minute in a small Receiver. A _Bat_
(although wounded) sustained the Pump two Minutes, and revived upon the
re-admission of the Air. After that, he remained four Minutes and a half
and revived. Lastly, After he had been five Minutes, he continued gasping
for a time, and after twenty Minutes I re-admitted the Air, but the _Bat_
never revived.

As for _Insects_: _Wasps_, _Bats_, _Hornets_, _Grashoppers_, and
_Lady-Cows_ seemed dead in appearance in two Minutes, but revived in the
open Air in two or three Hours time, notwithstanding they had been in
_Vacuo_ twenty four Hours.

The _Ear-wig_, the great _Staphylinus_, the great black lowsy _Beetle_,
and some other Insects would seem unconcerned at the _Vacuum_ a good
while, and lie as dead; but revive in the Air, although some had lain
sixteen Hours in the exhausted Receiver.

_Snails_ bear the Air Pump prodigiously, especially those in Shells; two
of which lay above twenty four Hours, and seemed not much affected. The
same Snails I left in twenty eight Hours more after a second Exhaustion,
and found one of them quite dead, but the other revived.

_Frogs_ and _Toads_ bear the Pump long, especially the former. A large
Toad, found in the House, died irrecoverably in less than six Hours.
Another Toad and Frog I put in together, and the Toad was seemingly dead
in two Hours, but the Frog just alive. After they had remained there
eleven Hours, and seemingly dead, the Frog recovered in the open Air,
only weak, but the Toad was quite dead. The same Frog being put in again
for twenty seven Hours, then quite died.

The Animalcules in _Pepper-Water_ remained in _Vacuo_ twenty four Hours.
And after they had been exposed a Day or two to the open Air, I found
some of them dead, some alive.

[g] That the Air is the principal Cause of the Vegetation of Plants,
_Borelli_ proves in his excellent Book _De Mot. Animal._ Vol. 2. Prop.
181. And in the next Proposition, he assureth, _In Plantis quoque peragi
Aeris respirationem quandam imperfectam, à quâ earum vita pendet, &
conservatur._ But of this more when I come to survey Vegetables.

_Some Lettice-Seed being sown upon some Earth in the open Air, and some
of the same Seed at the same time upon other Earth in a Glass-Receiver of
the Pneumatick Engine, afterwards exhausted of Air: The Seed exposed to
the Air was grown up an Inch and half high within Eight Days; but that in
the exhausted Receiver not at all. And Air being again admitted into the
same emptied Receiver, to see whether any of the Seed would then come up,
it was found, that in the Space of one Week it was grown up to the Height
of two or three Inches._ Vid. Phil. Trans. No. 23. Lowth. Abridg. Vol. 2.
p. 206.

[h] _In volucribus pulmones perforati aerem inspiratum in totam ventris
cavitatem admittunt. Hujus ratio, ut propter corporis truncum Aere
repletum & quasi extensum, ipsa magis volatilia evadant, faciliusque
ab aere externo, proper intimi penum, sustententur. Equidem pisces,
quò leviùs in aquis natent, in Abdomine vesicas Aere inflatas gestant:
pariter & volucres, propter corporis truncum Aere impletum & quasi
inflatum, nudo Aeri incumbentes, minus gravantur, proindeque levius &
expeditiùs volant._ Willis de Anim. Brut. p. 1. c. 3.

[i] _Fishes by reason of the Bladder of Air within them, can sustain, or
keep themselves in any Depth of Water: For the Air in that Bladder being
more or less compressed, according to the Depth the Fish swims at, takes
up more or less Space; and consequently, the Body of the Fish, part of
whose Bulk this Bladder is, is greater or less according to the several
Depths, and yet retains the same Weight. Now the Rule ~de Insidentibus
humido~ is, that a Body, that is heavier than so much Water, as is equal
in Quantity to the Bulk of it, will sink, a Body that is lighter will
swim; a Body of equal Weight will rest in any part of the Water. By
this Rule, if the Fish, in the middle Region of the Water, be of equal
Weight to the Water, that is commensurate to the Bulk of it, the Fish
will rest there, without any Tendency upwards or downwards: And if the
Fish be deeper in the Water, the Bulk of the Fish becoming less by the
Compression of the Bladder, and yet retaining the same Weight, it will
sink, and rest at the Bottom. And on the other side, if the Fish be
higher than the middle Region, the Air dilating it self, and the Bulk
of the Fish consequently increasing, but not the Weight, the Fish will
rise upwards and rest at the top of the Water. Perhaps the Fish by some
Action can emit Air out of its Bladder——, and, when not enough, take in
Air,——and then it will not be wondred, that there should be always a fit
Proportion of Air in all Fishes to serve their Use, ~&c.~_ Then follows
a Method of Mr. _Boyl_ to experiment the Truth of this. After which, in
Mr. _Lowthorp_’s Abridgment, follow Mr. _Ray_’s Observations. _I think
that——hath hit upon the true Use of the Swimming-Bladders in Fishes.
For, 1. It hath been observed, that if the Swimming-Bladder of any Fish
be pricked or broken, such a Fish sinks presently to the Bottom, and
can neither support or raise it self up in the Water. 2. Flat Fishes,
as Soles, Plaise, &c. which lie always grovelling at the Bottom, have
no Swimming-Bladders that ever I could find. 3. In most Fishes there is
a manifest Chanel leading from the Gullet——to the said Bladder, which
without doubt serves for the conveying Air thereunto.——In the Coat of
this Bladder is a musculous Power to contract it when the Fish lifts._
See more very curious Observations relating to this Matter, of the late
great Mr. _Ray_, as also of the curious anonymous Gentleman in the
ingenious Mr. _Lowthorp_’s Abridgment, before cited, _p. 845._ from
_Phil. Trans. N._ 114, 115.

[k] Among the Engines in which the Air is useful, Pumps may be
accounted not contemptible ones, and divers other Hydraulical Engines,
which need not to be particularly insisted on. In these the Water was
imagined to rise by the power of Suction, to avoid _a Vacuum_, and such
unintelligible Stuff; but the justly famous Mr. _Boyl_ was the first that
solved these Phænomena by the Weight of the Atmosphere. His ingenious and
curious Observations and Experiments relating hereto, may be seen in his
little Tract, _Of the Cause of Attraction by Suction_, and divers others
of his Tracts.

[l] It would be endless to specify the Uses of the Air in Nature’s
Operations: I shall therefore, for a Sample only, name its great Use to
the World in conserving animated Bodies, whether endowed with animal or
vegetative Life, and its contrary Quality of dissolving other Bodies;
by which means many Bodies that would prove Nuisances to the World,
are put out of the Way, by being reduced into their first Principles,
(as we say), and so embodied with the Earth again. Of its Faculty as a
Menstruum, or its Power to dissolve Bodies; I may instance in Crystal
Glasses, which, with long keeping, especially if not used, will in Time
be reduced to a Powder, as I have seen. So divers Minerals, Earths,
Stones, Fossil-Shells, Wood, _&c._ which from _Noah_’s Flood, at least
for many Ages, have lain under Ground, so secure from Corruption, that,
on the contrary, they have been thereby made much the stronger, have in
the open Air soon mouldered away. Of which last, Mr. _Boyl_ gives an
Instance (from the _Dissertation de admirandis Hungar. Aquis_) of a great
Oak, like a huge Beam, dug out of a Salt Mine in _Transylvania_, _so
hard, that it would not easily be wrought upon by Iron Tools, yet, being
exposed to the Air out of the Mine, it became so rotten that in four Days
it was easy to be broken, and crumbled between one’s Fingers_. Boyl’s
Suspic. about some hid. Qual. in the Air, p. 28. So the Trees turned out
of the Earth by the Breaches at _West-Thurrock_ and _Dagenham_, near
me, although probably no other than _Alder_, and interred many Ages ago
in a rotten oazy Mold, were so exceedingly tough, hard, and found at
first, that I could make but little Impressions on them with the Strokes
of an Ax; but being exposed to the Air and Water, soon became so rotten
as to be crumbled between the Fingers. See my Observations in _Philos.
Transact._ Nᵒ. 335.

[m] _By reflecting the Light of the heavenly Bodies to us_, I mean that
Whiteness or Lightness which is in the Air in the Day-time, caused by the
Rays of Light striking upon the Particles of the Atmosphere, as well as
upon the Clouds above, and the other Objects beneath upon the Earth. To
the same Cause also we owe the Twilight, _viz._ to the Sun-beams touching
the uppermost Particles of our Atmosphere, which they do when the Sun is
about eighteen Degrees beneath the Horizon. And as the Beams reach more
and more of the airy Particles, so Darkness goes off, and Day light comes
on and encreaseth. For an Exemplification of this, the Experiment may
serve of transmitting a few Rays of the Sun through a small Hole into
a dark Room: By which means the Rays which meet with Dust, and other
Particles flying in the Air, are render’d visible; or (which amounts to
the same) those swimming small Bodies are rendered visible, by their
reflecting the Light of the Sun-beams to the Eye, which, without such
Reflection, would it self be invisible.

beginning to condense, and that are not able to reflect the other

[n] By the Refractive Power of the Air, the Sun, and the other heavenly
Bodies seem higher than really they are, especially near the Horizon.

Alterations in time they cause, may be briefly seen in a little Book
called, _The Artificial Clock-Maker_, Chap. 11.

_Although this inflective Quality of the Air be a great Incumbrance and
Confusion of Astronomical Observations;——yet it is not without some
considerable Benefit to Navigation; and indeed in some Cases, the Benefit
thereby obtained is much greater than would be the Benefit of having the
Ray proceed in an exact straight Line._ [Then he mentions the Benefit
hereof to the Polar Parts of the World.] _But this by the by_ (saith he.)
_The great Advantage I consider therein, is the first Discovery of Land
upon the Sea; for by means hereof, the tops of Hills and Lands are raised
up into the Air, so as to be discoverable several Leagues farther off on
the Sea than they would be, were there no such Refraction, which is of
great Benefit to Navigation for steering their Course in the Night, when
they approach near Land; and likewise for directing them in the Day-time,
much more certainly than the most exact Celestial Observations could do
by the Help of an uninflected Ray, especially in such Places as they
have no Soundings._ [Then he proposes a Method to find by these means
the Distance of Objects at Sea.] V. Dr. _Hook_’s _Post. Works_. Lect. of

_Of the Winds[a]._


To pass by other Considerations, whereby I might demonstrate the Winds
to be the infinite Creator’s Contrivance, I shall insist only upon their
great usefulness to the World. And so great is their Use, and of such
absolute Necessity are they to the Salubrity of the Atmosphere, that all
the World would be poisoned without those Agitations thereof. We find
how putrid, fetid, and unfit for Respiration, as well as Health and
Pleasure, a stagnating, confined, pent up Air is. And if the whole Mass
of Air and Vapours was always at Rest, and without Motion, instead of
refreshing and animating, it would suffocate and poison all the World:
But the perpetual Commotions it receives from the Gales and Storms, keep
it pure and healthful[b].

Neither are those Ventilations beneficial only to the Health, but to the
Pleasure also of the Inhabitants of the Terraqueous Globe; witness the
Gales which fan us in the heat of Summer; without which, even in this
our temperate Zone, Men are scarce able to perform the Labours of their
Calling, or not without Danger of Health and Life[c]. But especially,
witness the perpetual Gales which throughout the whole Year do fan the
Torrid Zone, and make that Climate an healthful and pleasant Habitation,
which would otherwise be scarce habitable.

To these I might add many other great Conveniencies of the Winds in
various Engines, and various Businesses. I might particularly insist
upon its great Use to transport Men to the farthest distant Regions of
the World[d] and I might particularly speak of the general and coasting
Trade-Winds, the Sea, and the Land-Breezes;[e] the one serving to carry
the Mariner in long Voyages from East to West; the other serving to waft
him to particular Places; the one serving to carry him into his Harbour,
the other to bring him out. But I should go too far to take notice of all
Particulars[f]. Leaving therefore the Winds, I proceed in the next Place
to the Clouds and Rain.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] _Ventus est aer fluens_, is _Seneca_’s Definition, _Na. Qu. l. 5._
And as Wind is a Current of the Air, so that which excites or alters its
Currents may be justly said to be the Cause of the Winds. An Æquipoise of
the Atmosphere produceth a Calm; but if that Æquipoise be more or less
taken off, a Stream of Air, or Wind, is thereby accordingly produced
either stronger or weaker, swifter or slower. And divers things there
are that may make such Alterations in the Æquipoise or Balance of the
Atmosphere, _viz._ Eruptions of Vapours from Sea or Land; Rarefactions
and Condensations in one Place more than another; the falling of Rain,
pressure of the Clouds, _&c._ _Pliny_, l. 2. c. 45. tells us of a certain
_Cavern_ in _Dalmatia_, called _Senta_, _in quem_, saith he, _dejecto
levi pondere, quamvis tranquillo die, turbini similis emicat procella_.
But as to Caves it is observed, that they often emit Winds more or less.
Dr. _Connor_, taking notice of this matter, specifies these, _In regno
Neapolitano ex immani Cumanæ Sibyllæ antro tenuem ventum effluentem
percepi_. The like he observed at the Caves at _Baiæ_, and in some of the
Mines of _Germany_, and in the large Salt-Mines of _Cracow_ in _Poland_.
_Ubi_, saith he, _opifices, & ipse fodinæ dominus Andreas Morstin, Nob.
Polonus, mihi asseruerunt, quòd tanta aliquando Ventorum tempestas ex
ambagiosis hujus fodinæ recessibus surgere solebat, quod laborantes
fossores humi prosternebat, nec non portas & domiciliæ (quæ sibi in hâc
fodinâ artifices exstruunt) penitùs evertebat_. Bern. Connor. Dissert.
Med. Phys. p. 33. Artic. 3.

And as great Caves, so great Lakes sometimes send forth Winds. So
_Gassendus_ saith the _Lacus Legnius_ doth, _E quo dum exoritur fumus,
nubes haud dubiê creanda est, quæ sit brevi in tempestatem sævissimam
exoneranda_. Gassend. Vit. Peiresk. l. 5. P. 417.

But the most universal and constant Alterations of the Balance of the
Atmosphere are from Heat and Cold. This is manifest in the General
Trade-Winds, blowing all the Year between the Tropicks from East to
West: if the Cause thereof be (as some ingenious Men imagine) the Sun’s
daily Progress round that part of the Globe, and by his Heat rarefying
one part of the Air, whilst the cooler and heavier Air behind presseth
after. So the Sea and Land Breezes in _Note (d)._ And so in our Climate,
the Northerly and Southerly Winds (commonly esteemed the Causes of cold
and warm Weather), are really the Effects of the Cold or Warmth of the
Atmosphere: Of which I have had so many Confirmations, that I have no
doubt of it. As for Instance, it is not uncommon to see a warm Southerly
Wind, suddenly changed to the North, by the fall of Snow or Hail; to see
the Wind in a frosty, cold Morning North, and when the Sun hath well
warmed the Earth and Air, you may observe it to wheel about towards
the Southerly Quarters; and again to turn Northerly or Easterly in the
cold Evening. It is from hence also, that in Thunder-Showers the Wind
and Clouds are oftentimes contrary to one another, (especially if Hail
falls) the sultry Weather below directing the Wind one way; and the Cold
above the Clouds another way. I took Notice upon _March_ the 10ᵗʰ 1710/1,
(and divers such like Instances I have had before and since) that the
Morning was warm, and what Wind stirred was West-South-West, but the
Clouds were thick and black (as generally they are when Snow ensues): A
little before Noon the Wind veered about to North by West, and sometimes
to other Points, the Clouds at the same time flying some North by West,
some South-West: About one of the Clock it rained apace, the Clouds
flying sometimes North-East, then North, and at last both Wind and Clouds
settled North by West; At which time Sleet fell plentifully, and it grew
very cold. From all which I observe, 1. That although our Region below
was warm, the Region of the Clouds was cold, as the black, snowy Clouds
shewed. 2. That the struggle between the warmth of ours, and the cold of
the cloudy Region, stopped the airy Currents of both Regions. 3. That the
falling of the Snow through our warmer Air melted into Rain at first; but
that it became Sleet after the superiour Cold had conquered the inferiour
Warmth. 4. That, as that Cold prevailed by Degrees, so by Degrees it
wheeled about both the Winds and Clouds from the Northwards towards the
South.

Summer, the Plague often ensues: So that it is now grown into a Proverb,
that if ~Austria~ be not windy, it is subject to Contagion._ Bohun of
Wind, _p. 213._

From some such Commotions of the Air I imagine it is, that at _Grand
Cairo_ the Plague immediately ceases, as soon as the _Nile_ begins to
overflow; although Mr. _Boyl_ attributes it to nitrous Corpuscles.

Quæst. l. 5. c. 17, 18.

All this is more evident, from the Cause assigned to malignant epidemical
Diseases, particularly the Plague, by my ingenious, learned Friend, Dr.
_Mead_; and that is, an hot and moist Temperament of the Air, which
is observed by _Hippocrates_, _Galen_, and the general Histories of
Epidemical Diseases, to attend those Distempers. _Vid._ _Mead of Poisons,
Essay 5._ p. 161. But indeed, whether the Cause be this, or poisonous,
malignant Exhalations or Animalcules, as others think, the Winds are
however very salutiferous in such Cases, in cooling the Air, and
dispersing and driving away the moist or pestiferous Vapours.

[c] _July 8. 1707_, (called for some time after the _Hot Tuesday_,)
was so excessively hot and suffocating, by reason there was no Wind
stirring, that divers Persons died, or were in great Danger of Death, in
their Harvest-Work. Particularly one who had formerly been my Servant, a
healthy, lusty, young Man, was killed by the Heat: And several Horses on
the Road dropped down and died the same Day.

In the foregoing Notes, having Notice of some Things relating to Heat,
although it be somewhat out of the way, I hope the Reader will excuse me,
if I entertain him with some Observations I made about the Heat of the
Air under the Line, compared with the Heat of our Bodies. _J. Patrick_,
who, as he is very accurate in making Barometrical and Thermometrical
Instruments, had the Curiosity for the nicer adjusting his Thermometers,
to send two abroad under the Care of two very sensible, ingenious
Men; one to the Northern Lat. of 81; the other to the Parts under the
Æquinoctial: In these two different Climates, the Places were marked
where the Spirits stood at the severest Cold and greatest Heat. And
according to these Observations he graduates his Thermometers. With his
Standard I compared my Standard Thermometer, from all the Degrees of
Cold, I could make with _Sal Armoniack_, &c. to the greatest Degrees of
Heat our Thermometers would reach to. And with the same Thermometer (of
mine) I experimented the greatest Heat of my Body, in _July 1709_. First
in an hot Day without Exercise, by patting the Ball of my Thermometer
under my Armpits, and other hottest Parts of my Body. By which means the
Spirits were raised 284 Tenths of an Inch above the Ball. After that, in
a much hotter Day, and indeed nearly as hot as any Day with us, and after
I had heated my self with strong Exercise too, as much as I could well
bear, I again tried the same Experiment, but could not get the Spirits
above 288 Tenths; which I thought an inconsiderable Difference, for so
seemingly a very different Heat of my Body. But from some Experiments
I have made (altho’ I have unfortunately forgotten them) in very cold
Weather, I imagine the Heat of an healthy Body to be always much the same
in the warmest Parts thereof, both in Summer and Winter. Now between
those very Degrees of 284 and 288, the Point of the equatorial Heat
falleth. From which Observation it appears, that there is pretty nearly
an equal Contemperament of the Warmth of our Bodies, to that of the
hottest Part of the Atmosphere inhabited by us.

If the Proportion of the Degrees of Heat be desired from the
Freezing-Point, to the Winter, Spring, and Summer Air, the Heat of Man’s
Body, of heated Water, melted Metals, and so to actual Fire; an Account
may be met with of it, by my most ingenious Friend, the great Sir _Isaac
Newton_, in _Phil. Transact._ Nᵒ. 270.

[e] _~Sea-Breezes~ commonly rise in the Morning about nine a Clock.——They
first approach the Shore gently, as if they were afraid to come near
it.——It comes in a fine, small, black Curle upon the Water, whereas all
the Sea between it and the Shore (not yet reached by it) is as smooth
and even as Glass in Comparison. In half an Hours time after it has
reached the Shore, it fans pretty briskly, and so encreaseth gradually
till twelve a Clock; then it is commonly strongest, and lasts so till two
or three, a very brisk Gale.——After three it begins to die away again,
and gradually withdraws its force till all is spent; and about five a
Clock——it is lulled asleep, and comes no more till next morning._

_And as the Sea Breezes do blow in the Day, and rest in the Night; so on
the contrary ~[The Land-Breezes]~ blow in the Night, and rest in the Day,
alternately succeeding each other.——They spring up between six and twelve
at Night, and last till six, eight, or ten in the Morning._ Dampier’s
Disc. of Winds, _ch._ 4.

[f] One Thing more I believe some of my Friends will expect from me is,
that I shew the Result of comparing my own Observations of the Winds,
with others they know I have from _Ireland_, _Switzerland_, _Italy_,
_France_, _New-England_, and some of our Parts of _England_. But the
Observations being some of them but of one Year, and most of the rest of
but a few Years, I have not been able to determine any great Matters.
The chief of what I have observed is, that the Winds in all these Places
seldom agree, but when they most certainly do so, it is commonly when
the Winds are strong, and of long continuance in the same Quarter: And
more I think in the Northerly and Easterly, than other Points. Also a
strong Wind in one Place, is oftentimes a weak one in another Place,
or moderate, according as Places have been nearer or farther distant.
_Vid._ _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 297, and 321. But to give a good and tolerable
Account of this or any other of the Weather, it is necessary to have good
Histories thereof from all Parts; which, as yet we have but few of, and
they imperfect, for want of longer and sufficient Observations.




CHAP. III.

_Of the Clouds and Rain._


The Clouds and Rain[a] we shall find to be no less useful Meteors than
the last mentioned; as is manifest in the refreshing pleasant Shades
which the Clouds afford, and the fertile Dews and Showers which they
pour down on the Trees and Plants, which would languish and die with
perpetual Drought, but are hereby made Verdant and Flourishing, Gay and
Ornamental; so that (as the Psalmist saith, _Psal._ lxv. 12, 13.) _The
little Hills rejoice on every side, and the Valleys shout for Joy, they
also sing._

And, if to these Uses, we should add the Origine of Fountains and
Rivers, to Vapours and the Rains, as some of the most eminent modern
Philosophers[b] have done, we should have another Instance of the great
Use and Benefit of that Meteor.

And now, if we reflect upon this necessary Appendage of the Terraqueous
Globe, the _Atmosphere_; and consider the absolute Necessity thereof to
many Uses of our Globe, and its great Convenience to the whole: And in
a Word, that it answereth all the Ends and Purposes that we can suppose
there can be for such an Appendage: Who can but own this to be the
Contrivance, the Work of the great Creator? Who would ever say or imagine
such a Body, so different from the Globe it serves, could be made by
Chance, or be adapted so exactly to all those forementioned grand Ends,
by any other Efficient than by the Power and Wisdom of the infinite God!
Who would not rather, from so noble a Work, readily acknowledge the
Workman[c] and as easily conclude the Atmosphere to be made by GOD, as an
Instrument wrought by its Power, any Pneumatick Engine, to be contrived
and made by Man!


FOOTNOTES:

[a] Clouds and Rain are made of Vapours raised from Water, or Moisture
only. So that I utterly exclude the Notion of Dry, Terrene Exhalations,
or Fumes, talked much of by most Philosophers; Fumes being really no
other than the humid Parts of Bodies respectively Dry.

These Vapours are demonstratively no other than small Bubbles, or
Vesiculæ detached from the Waters by the Power of the Solar, or
Subterraneous Heat, or both. Of which see _Book 2. Chap. 5. Note (b)._
And being lighter than the Atmosphere, are buoyed up thereby, until they
become of an equal Weight therewith, in some of its Regions aloft in the
Air, or nearer the Earth; in which those Vapours are formed into Clouds,
Rain, Snow, Hail, Lightning, Dew, Mists, and other Meteors.

In this Formation of Meteors the grand Agent is Cold, which commonly, if
not always, occupies the superior Regions of the Air; as is manifest from
those Mountains which exalt their lofty Tops into the upper and middle
Regions, and are always covered with Snow and Ice.

This Cold, if it approaches near the Earth, presently precipitates the
Vapours, either in _Dews_; or if the Vapours more copiously ascend, and
soon meet the Cold, they are then condensed into _Misting_, or else into
Showers of _small Rain_, falling in numerous, thick, small Drops: But if
those Vapours are not only copious, but also as heavy as our lower Air it
self, (by means their Bladders are thick and fuller of Water,) in this
Case they become visible, swim but a little Height above the Earth, and
make what we call a _Mist_ or _Fog_. But if they are a Degree lighter, so
as to mount higher, but not any great Height, as also meet not with Cold
enough to condense them, nor Wind to dissipate them, they then form an
heavy, thick, _dark Sky_, lasting oftentimes for several Weeks without
either Sun or Rain. And in this Case, I have scarce ever known it to
Rain, till it hath been _first Fair, and then Foul_. And Mr. _Clarke_,
(an ingenious Clergyman of _Norfolk_, who in his Life-time, long before
me, took notice of it, and kept a Register of the Weather for thirty
Years, which his learned Grandson, Dr. _Samuel Clarke_ put into my Hands,
he, I say) saith, he scarce ever observed the Rule to fail in all that
Time; only he adds, _If the Wind be in some of the easterly Points_. But
I have observed the same to happen, be the Wind where it will. And from
what hath been said, the Case is easily accounted for, _viz._ whilst
the Vapours remain in the same State, the Weather doth so too. And such
Weather is generally attended with moderate Warmth, and with little or no
Wind to disturb the Vapours, and an heavy Atmosphere to support them, the
Barometer being commonly high then. But when the Cold approacheth, and
by condensing drives the Vapours into Clouds or Drops, then is way made
for the Sun-beams, till the same Vapours, being by further Condensation
formed into Rain, fall down in Drops.

The Cold’s approaching the Vapours, and consequently the Alteration of
such dark Weather I have beforehand perceived, by some few small Drops
of Rain, Hail, or Snow, now and then falling, before any Alteration hath
been in the Weather; which I take to be from the Cold meeting some of the
straggling Vapours, or the uppermost of them, and condensing them into
Drops, before it arrives unto, and exerts it self upon the main Body of
Vapours below.

I have more largely than ordinary insisted upon this part of the Weather,
partly, as being somewhat out of the way; but chiefly, because it gives
Light to many other _Phænomena_ of the Weather. Particularly we may
hence discover the Original of Clouds, Rain, Hail and Snow; that they
are Vapours carried aloft by the Gravity of the Air, which meeting
together so as to make a Fog above, they thereby form a _Cloud_. If the
Cold condenseth them into Drops, they then fall in _Rain_, if the Cold
be not intense enough to freeze them: But if the Cold freezeth them in
the Clouds, or in their Fall through the Air, they then become _Hail_ or
_Snow_.

As to _Lightning_, and other enkindled Vapours, I need say little in this
Place, and shall therefore only observe, that they owe also their Rise
to Vapours; but such Vapours as are detached from mineral Juices, or at
least that are mingled with them, and are fired by Fermentation.

Another _Phænomenon_ resolvable from what hath been said is, why a
_cold_, is always a _wet_ Summer, _viz._ because the Vapours rising
plentifully then, are by the Cold soon collected into Rain. A remarkable
Instance of this we had in the Summer of 1708, part of which, especially
about the _Solstice_, was much colder than usually. On _June 12_, it
was so cold, that my Thermometer was near the Point of hoar Frost, and
in some Places I heard there was an hoar Frost; and during all the cool
Weather of that Month, we had frequent and large Rains, so that the
whole Month’s Rain amounted to above two Inches Depth, which is a large
Quantity for _Upminster_, even in the wettest Months. And not only with
us at _Upminster_, but in other Places, particularly at _Zurich_ in
_Switzerland_, they seem to have had as unseasonable Cold and Wet as we.
_Fuit hic mensis——præter modum humidus, & magno quidem vegetabilibus
hominibusque damno. Multum computruit Fœnum, ~&c.~_ complains the
industrious and learned Dr. _J. J. Scheuchzer_: Of which, and other
Particulars, I have given a larger Account in _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 321.

In which _Transaction_ I have observed farther, that about the Equinoxes
we (at _Upminster_ at least) have oftentimes more Rain than at other
Seasons. The Reason of which is manifest from what hath been said,
_viz._ in Spring, when the Earth and Waters are loosed from the brumal
Constipations, the Vapours arise in great Plenty: And the like they do in
Autumn, when the Summer Heats, that both dissipated them, and warmed the
superior Regions, are abated; and then the Cold of the superior Regions
meeting them, condenseth them into Showers, more plentifully than at
other Seasons, when either the Vapours are fewer, or the Cold that is to
condense them is less.

The manner how Vapours are precipitated by the Cold, or reduced into
Drops, I conceive to be thus: Vapours being, as I said, no other than
inflated _Vesiculæ_ of Water; when they meet with a colder Air than what
is contained in them, the contained Air is reduced into a less Space, and
the watery Shell or Case rendered thicker by that means, so as to become
heavier than the Air, by which they are buoyed up, and consequently must
needs fall down. Also many of those thickned _Vesiculæ_ run into one, and
so form Drops, greater or smaller, according to the Quantity of Vapours
collected together.

As to the Rain of different Places, I have in some of our _Transactions_
assigned the Quantities; particularly in the last cited _Transaction_, I
have assigned these, _viz._ the Depth of the Rain one Year with another,
in _English_ Measure, if it was to stagnate on the Earth, would amount
unto, at _Townely_ in _Lancashire_, 42½ Inches; at _Upminster_ in _Essex_
19¼ Inches; at _Zurich_ in _Switzerland_ 32¼ Inches; at _Pisa_ in
_Italy_ 43¼ Inches; at _Paris_ in _France_ 19 Inches; and at _Lisle_ in
_Flanders_ 24 Inches.

It would be endless to reckon up the _bloody_ and other _prodigious
Rains_ taken notice of by Historians, and other Authors, as præternatural
and ominous Accidents; but, if strictly pried into, will be found owing
to natural Causes: Of which, for the Reader’s Satisfaction, I will
give an Instance or two. A bloody Rain was imagined to have fallen in
_France_, which put the Country People into so great a Fright, that
they left their Work in the Fields, and in great haste flew to the
Neighbouring Houses. _Peirise_ (then in the Neighbourhood) strictly
enquiring into the Cause, found it to be only red Drops coming from a
sort of Butterfly that flew about in great Numbers at that Time, as
he concluded from seeing such red Drops come from them; and because
these Drops were laid, _Non supra ædificia, non in devexis lapidum
superficiebus, uti debuerat contingere, si è cœlo sanguine pluisset;
sed in subcavis potius & in foraminibus.——Accessit, quòd parietes iis
tingebantur, non qui in mediis oppidis, sed qui agrorum vicini erant,
neque secundum partes elatiores, sed ad mediocrem solùm altitudinem,
quantam volitare Papiliones solent._ Gassend in vit. Peiresk. L. 2. p.
156.

So Dr. _Merret_ saith also, _Pluvia Sanguinis quàm certissimè constat
esse tantùm Insectorum excrementa: Pluvia Tritici quàm nihil aliud esse
quàm Hederæ bacciferæ grana à Sturnis devorata excretaque comparanti
liquidissimè patet_. Pinax rerum, _&c._ _p. 220._

The curious _Worm_ tells of the raining of Brimstone, _An. 1646. Maii
16._ _Hic Hafniæ cùm ingenti pluviâ tota urbs, omnesque ita inundarentur
plateæ, ut gressus hominum impediret, Sulphureoque odore aërem inficeret,
dilapsis aliquantulum aquis, quibusdam in locis colligere licuit
Sulphureum pulverem, cujus portionem servo, colore, odore, & aliis verum
Sulphur ferentem._ Mus. Worm. L. 1. c. 11. Sect. 1.

Together with the Rain we might take notice of other Meteors,
particularly _Snow_; which although an irksome Guest, yet hath its
great Uses, if all be true that the famous _T. Bartholin_ saith of
it, who wrote a Book _de Nivis usu Medico_. In which he shews of what
great Use Snow is in fructifying the Earth, preserving from the Plague,
curing Fevers, Colicks, Head-Aches, Tooth-Aches, Sore Eyes, Pleurisies,
(for which Use he saith his Country-Women of _Denmark_ keep Snow-Water
gathered in _March_), also in prolonging Life, (of which he instanceth in
the _Alpine_ Inhabitants, that live to a great Age,) and preserving dead
Bodies; Instances of which he gives in Persons buried under the Snow in
passing the _Alps_, which are found uncorrupted in the Summer, when the
Snow is melted; which sad Spectacle he himself was an Eye-Witness of. And
at _Spitzberg_ in _Greenland_, dead Bodies remain entire and uncorrupted
for thirty Years. And lastly, concerning such as are so preserv’d when
slain, he saith they remain in the same Posture and Figure: Of which
he gives this odd Example, _Visum id extra urbem nostram ~[Hafniam]~
quum, 11 Feb. 1659. oppugnantes hostes repellerentur, magnâque strage
occumberent; alii enim rigidi iratum vultum ostendebant, alii oculos
elatos, alii ore diducto ringentes, alii brachiis extensis Gladium
minari, alii alio situ prostrati jacebant_. Barthol. de usu Niv. c. 12.

But although Snow be attended with the Effects here named, and others
specified by the learned _Bartholin_; yet this is not to be attributed to
any peculiar Virtue in the Snow, but some other Cause. Thus when it is
said to _fructify the Earth_, it doth so by guarding the Corn or other
Vegetables against the intenser cold of the Air, especially the cold
piercing Winds; which the Husbandmen observe to be the most injurious to
their Corn of all Weathers. So for _Conserving dead Bodies_, it doth it
by constipating such Bodies, and preventing all such Fermentations or
internal Conflicts of their Particles, as would produce Corruption.

Such an Example as the preceding is said to have happened some Years
ago at _Paris_, in digging in a Cellar for supposed hidden Treasure;
in which, after digging some Hours, the Maid going to call her Master,
found them all in their digging Postures, but dead. This being noised
abroad, brought in not only the People, but Magistrates also, who found
them accordingly; _Ille qui ligone terram effoderat, & socius qui palâ
effossam terram removerat, ambo pedibus stabant, quasi sua quisque
operâ affixus incubuisset; uxor unius quasi ab opere defessa in scamno,
solicito quodam vultu, sedebat, inclinato in palmam manûs genibus
innitentis capite; puerulus laxatis braccis in margine excavatæ foveæ
defixis in terram oculis alvum exonerabat; omnes in naturali situ, carneæ
tanquam statuæ rigidi, apertis oculis & vultu vitam quasi respirante,
exanimes stabant._ Dr. Bern. Connor, Dissert. Med. Phys. _p. 15._

The Doctor attributes all this to Cold; but I scarce think there could
be Cold enough to do all this at _Paris_, and in a Cellar too. Bur his
following Stories are not improbable, of Men and Cattle killed with Cold,
that remained in the very same Posture in which they died; of which he
gives, from a _Spanish_ Captain, this Instance, that happened two Years
before, of a Soldier who unfortunately straggled from his Company that
were foraging, and was killed with the Cold, but was thought to have
fallen into the Enemies Hands. But soon after their return to their
Quarters, they saw their Comrade returning, sitting on Horseback, and
coming to congratulate him, found him dead, and that he had been brought
thither in the same Posture on Horseback, notwithstanding the jolting of
the Horse. _Ibid. p._ 18.

[b] Of this Opinion was my late most ingenious and learned Friend, Mr.
_Ray_, whose Reasons see in his _Physico-Theolog. Discourses_, Disc. 2.
ch. 2. p. 89, _&c_. So also my no less learned and ingenious Friends,
Dr. _Halley_, and the late Dr. _Hook_, many of the _French_ Vertuoso’s
also, and divers other very considerable Men before them, too many to be
specified here.

CHAP. IV.

_Of Light._


Thus much for the first Thing ministring to the Terraqueous Globe, the
Atmosphere and its Meteors; the next Appendage is _Light_.[a] Concerning
which I have in my Survey of the Heavens[b] shewed what admirable
Contrivances the infinitely wise Creator hath for the affording this
noble, glorious and comfortable Benefit to other Globes, as well as
ours; the Provision he hath made by Moons, as well as by the Sun, for the
Communication of it.

And now let us briefly consider the great Necessity and Use thereof to
all our Animal World. And this we shall find to be little less than the
very Life and Pleasure of all those Creatures. For what Benefit would
Life be of, what Pleasure, what Comfort would it be for us to live
in perpetual Darkness? How could we provide ourselves with Food and
Necessaries? How could we go about the least Business, correspond with
one another, or be of any Use in the World, or any Creatures be the same
to us, without Light, and those admirable Organs of the Body, which the
great _Creator_ hath adapted to the Perception of that great Benefit?

But now by the help of this admirable, this first-made[c], because most
necessary, Creature of God, by this, I say, all the Animal World is
enabled to go here and there, as their Occasions call; they can transact
their Business by Day, and refresh and recruit themselves by Night,
with Rest and Sleep. They can with Admiration and Pleasure, behold the
glorious Works of God; they can view the Glories of the Heavens, and
see the Beauties of the flowry Fields, the gay Attire of the feathered
Tribe, the exquisite Garniture of many Quadrupeds, Insects, and other
Creatures; they can take in the delightsome Landskips of divers Countries
and Places; they can with Admiration see the great Creator’s wonderful
Art and Contrivance in the Parts of Animals and Vegetables: And in a
word, behold the Harmony of this lower World, and of the Globes above,
and survey God’s exquisite Workmanship in every Creature.

To all which I might add the Improvements which the Sagacity of Men hath
made of this noble Creature of God, by the Refractions and Reflections of
Glasses. But it would be endless to enumerate all its particular Uses and
Benefits to our World.

But before I leave this Point, there are two Things concerning Light,
which will deserve an especial Remark; and that is, its swift and almost
instantaneous Motion, and its vast Extension.

1. It is a very great Act of the Providence of God, that so great a
Benefit as Light is, is not long in its Passage from Place to Place. For
was the Motion thereof no swifter than the Motion of the swiftest Bodies
on Earth, such as of a Bullet out of a great Gun, or even of a Sound[d]
(which is the swiftest Motion we have next Light), in this Case Light
would take up, in its Progress from the Sun to us above thirty two Years
at the rate of the first, and above seventeen Years at the rate of the
latter Motion.

The Inconveniencies of which would be, its Energy and Vigour would
be greatly cooled and abated; its Rays would be less penetrant; and
Darkness would with greater Difficulty and much Sluggishness, be
dissipated, especially by the fainter Lights of our sublunary, luminous
Bodies. But passing with such prodigious Velocity, with nearly the
instantaneous Swiftness of almost Two hundred thousand _English_ Miles in
one Second of Time,[e] or (which is the same Thing) being but about seven
or eight Minutes of an Hour in coming from the Sun to us, therefore with
all Security and Speed, we receive the kindly Effects and Influences of
that noble and useful Creature of God.

2. Another Thing of great Consideration about Light is, its vast
Expansion, it’s almost incomprehensible, and inconceivable Extension,
which as a late ingenious Author[f] saith, “Is as boundless and
unlimited as the Universe it self, or the Expansum of all material
Beings: The vastness of which is so great, that it exceeds the
Comprehensions of Man’s Understanding. Insomuch that very many have
asserted it absolutely infinite, and without any Limits or Bounds.”

And that this noble Creature of God is of this Extent,[g] is manifest
from our seeing some of the farthest distant Objects, the heavenly
Bodies, some with our naked Eye, some with the help of Optical
Instruments, and others in all Probability farther and farther, with
better and better Instruments: And had we Instruments of Power equivalent
to the Extent of Light, the luminous Bodies of the utmost Parts of the
Universe, would for the same Reason be visible too.

Now as Light is of greatest Use to impower us to see Objects at all, so
the Extension thereof is no less useful to enable us to see Objects afar
off. By which means we are afforded a Ken of those many glorious Works
of the infinite Creator, visible in the Heavens, and can improve them to
some of the noblest Sciences, and most excellent Uses of our own Globe.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] It is not worth while to enumerate the Opinions of the
_Aristotelians_, _Cartesians_, and others, about the Nature of Light,
_Aristotle_ making it a Quality; _Cartes_ a Pulsion, or Motion of the
Globules of the second Element, _Vid._ _Cartes Princip._ p. 3. §. 55,
_&c._ But with the Moderns, I take _Light_ to consist of material
Particles, propagated from the Sun, and other luminous Bodies, not
instantaneously, but in time, according to the Notes following in this
Chapter. But not to insist upon other Arguments for the Proof of it, our
noble Founder hath proved the Materiality of Light and Heat, from actual
Experiments on Silver, Copper, Tin, Lead, Spelter, Iron, Tutenage, and
other Bodies, exposed (both naked and closely shut up) to the Fire: All
which were constantly found to receive an Increment of Weight. I wish he
could have met with a favourable Season to have tried his Experiments
with the Sun-beams as he intended. _Vid._ _Boyl Exp. to make Fire and
Flame ponderable_.

[c] Gen. i. 3. _And God said, Let there be Light, and there was Light._

[d] It may not be ungrateful to the Curious, to take notice of the
Velocity of these two Things.

According to the Observations of _Mersennus_, a Bullet-shot out of
a great Gun, flies 92 Fathom in a Second of Time, (_Vid._ _Mersen.
Balist._) which is equal to 589½ Feet _English_, and according to the
Computation of Mr. _Huygens_, it would be 25 years in passing from the
Earth to the Sun. But according to my own Observations made with one
of her Majesty’s _Sakers_, and a very accurate Pendulum-Chronometer, a
Bullet, at its first Discharge, flies 510 Yards in five half Seconds,
which is a Mile in a little above 17 half Seconds. And allowing the Sun’s
Distance to be, as in the next Note, a Bullet would be 32½ Years in
flying with its utmost Velocity to the Sun.

As to the Velocity of Sound, see _Book 4. Chap. 3. Note 28._ according
to which rate there mentioned, a Sound would be near 17½ Years in flying
as far as the distance is from the Earth to the Sun. Confer here the
Experiments of the _Acad. del Ciment._ p. 140, _&c._

[e] Mr. _Romer_’s ingenious Hypothesis about the Velocity of Light, hath
been established by the _Royal Academy_, and in the _Observatory_ for
eight Years, as our _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 136. observe from the _Journ.
des Scavans_; our most eminent Astronomers also in _England_ admit
it: But Dr. _Hook_ thinks with Monsieur _Cartes_, the Motion of Light
Instantaneous, _Hook Post. Works, pag. 77._ And this he endeavours to
explain, _pag. 130_, &c.

What Mr. _Romer_’s Hypothesis is, may be seen in the _Phil. Transact._
before-cited: As also in the before commended Sir _Isaac Newton_’s
_Opticks_: _Light is propagated from luminous Bodies in time, and spends
about seven or eight Minutes of an Hour in passing from the Sun to the
Earth. This was first observed by ~Romer~, and then by others, by means
of the Eclipses of the Satellites of ~Jupiter~. For these Eclipses, when
the Earth is between the Sun and ~Jupiter~, happen about seven or eight
Minutes sooner than they ought to do by the Tables; and when the Earth is
beyond the ☉, they happen about seven or eight Minutes later than they
ought to do: The reason being, that the Light of the Satellites hath
farther to go in the latter Case than in the former, by the Diameter of
the Earth’s Orbit._ Newt. Opt. L. 2. Part. 3. Prop. 11.

Now forasmuch as the Distance between the Sun and the Earth (according
to the Computations in my _Astro-Theology_, _B. 1. ch. 3. Note 2._) is
86051398 _English_ Miles; therefore, at the rate of 7½ Minutes, or 450
Seconds in passing from the Sun, Light will be found to fly above 191225
Miles in one Second of Time.

[f] Dr. _Hook_ Post. Works. Lect. of Light, _pag. 76._

[g] For the proof of this vast Extent of Light, I shall take the
Computation of the same great Man, _pag. 77_. _If_, saith he, _we
consider first the vast Distance between us and the Sun, which from the
best and latest Observations in Astronomy, is judged to be about 10000
Diameters of the Earth, each of which It about 7925 ~English~ Miles;
therefore the Sun’s distance is 7925000 Miles; and if we consider that
according to the Observations, which I published to prove the Motion of
the Earth, ~[which were Observations of the Parallax of some of the fixt
Stars in the Head of _Draco_, made in 1699]~ the whole Diameter of the
Orb, ~viz.~ 20000, made the Subtense but of one Minute to one of the fixt
Stars, which cannot therefore be less distant than 3438 Diameters of this
great Orb, and consequently 68760000 Diameters of the Earth: And if this
Star be one of the nearest, and that the Stars that are of one Degree
lesser in Magnitude (I mean not of the Second Magnitude, because there
may be many Degrees between the first and second) be as much farther;
and another sort yet smaller be three times as far; and a fourth four
times as far, and so onward, possibly to some 100 Degrees of Magnitude,
such as may be discovered by longer and longer Telescopes, that they may
be 100 times as far; then certainly this material Expansion, a part of
which we are, must be so great, that ’twill infinitely exceed our shallow
Conception to imagine. Now, by what I last mentioned, it is evident that
Light extends it self to the utmost imaginable Parts, and by the help
of Telescopes we collect the Rays, and make them sensible to the Eye,
which are emitted from some of the almost inconceivably remote Objects,
~&c.~——Nor is it only the great Body of the Sun, or the vast Bodies of
the fixt Stars, that are thus able to disperse their Light through the
vast Expansum of the Universe; but the smallest Spark of a lucid Body
will do the very same Thing, even the smallest Globule struck from a
Steel by a Flint, ~&c.~_




CHAP. V.

_Of Gravity._


The last Thing subservient to our Globe, that I shall take notice of, is
_Gravity_[a], or that Tendency which Bodies have to the Centre of the
Earth.

In my _Astro-Theology_, _Book 6. Ch. 2._ I have shewn of what absolute
Necessity, and what a noble Contrivance this of Gravity is, for keeping
the several Globes of the Universe from shattering to Pieces, as they
evidently must do in a little Time by their swift Rotation round their
own Axes[b]. The Terraqueous Globe particularly, which circumvolves at
the rate of above 1000 Miles an Hour[c], would by the centrifugal force
of that Motion, be soon dissipated and spirtled into the circumambient
Space, was it not kept together by this noble Contrivance of the Creator,
this natural inherent Power, namely, the Power of Attraction or Gravity.

And as by this Power our Globe is defended against Dissipation, so all
its Parts are kept in their proper Place and Order. All material Things
do naturally gravitate thereto, and unite themselves therewith, and so
preserve its Bulk intire[d]. And the fleeting Waters, the most unruly
of all its Parts, do by this means keep their constant æquipoise in the
Globe[e], and remain in _that Place which_, the Psalmist saith, _God had
founded for them; a bound he had set, which they might not pass; that
they turn not again to cover the Earth_, Psal. civ. 8, 9. So, that even
in a natural Way, by virtue of this excellent Contrivance of the Creator,
the Observation of the Psalmist is perpetually fulfilled, _Psal._ lxxxix.
9. _Thou rulest the raging of the Sea; when the Waves thereof arise, thou
stillest them._

To these, and an hundred other Uses of Gravity that I might have
named, I shall only just mention another Thing owing to it, and that
is _Levity_[f], that, whereby what we call light Bodies swim, a Thing
no less useful to the World than its opposite, _Gravity_, is in many
Respects, to divers Tribes of Animals, but particularly serviceable to
the raising up of Vapours[g], and to their Conveyance about the World.

And now from this transient View of no other than the Out-works, than
the bare Appendages of the Terraqueous Globe, we have so manifest a
Sample of the Wisdom, Power, and Goodness of the infinite Creator, that
it is easy to imagine the whole Fabrick is of a Piece, the Work of at
least a skilful Artist. A Man that should meet with a Palace[h], beset
with pleasant Gardens, adorned with stately Avenues, furnished with
well-contrived Aqueducts, Cascades, and all other Appendages conducing
to Convenience or Pleasure, would easily imagine, that proportionable
Architecture and Magnificence were within: But we should conclude the
Man was out of his Wits that should assert and plead that all was the
Work of Chance, or other than of some wise and skilful Hand. And so when
we survey the bare Out-works of this our Globe, when we see so vast a
Body, accouter’d with so noble a Furniture of Air, Light and Gravity;
with every Thing, in short, that is necessary to the Preservation and
Security of the Globe it self, or that conduceth to the Life, Health, and
Happiness, to the Propagation and Increase of all the prodigious Variety
of Creatures the Globe is stocked with; when we see nothing wanting,
nothing redundant or frivolous, nothing botching or ill-made, but that
every thing, even in the very Appendages alone, exactly answereth all
its Ends and Occasions: What else can be concluded, but that all was
made with manifest Design, and that all the whole Structure is the Work
of some intelligent Being; some Artist, of Power and Skill equivalent to
such a Work?


FOOTNOTES:

[a] That there is such a Thing as _Gravity_, is manifest from its Effects
here upon Earth; and that the Heavenly Bodies attract or gravitate to
one another, when placed at due Distances, is made highly probable by
Sir _Isaac Newton_. This attractive or gravitating Power, I take to be
congenial to Matter, and imprinted on all the Matter of the Universe
by the Creator’s _Fiat_ at the Creation. What the _Cause_ of it is,
the _Newtonian Philosophy_ doth not pretend to determine for want of
Phænomena, upon which Foundation it is that that Philosophy is grounded,
and not upon chimerical and uncertain Hypotheses: But whatever the Cause
is, that _Cause penetrates even to the Centers of the Sun and Planets,
without any Diminution of its Virtue; and it acteth not according to the
Superficies of Bodies (as Mechanical Causes do) but in proportion to
the Quantity of their solid Matter; ~and lastly~, it acteth all round
it at immense Distances, decreasing in duplicate proportion to those
Distances_, as Sir _Isaac Newton_ saith, _Princip._ pag. ult. What useful
Deductions, and what a rational Philosophy have been drawn from hence,
may be seen in the same Book.

This Attraction, or Gravity, as its Force is in a certain proportion, so
makes the Descent of Bodies to be at a certain rate. And was it not for
the Resistence of the Medium, all Bodies would descend to the Earth at
the same rate; the lightest Down, as swiftly as the heaviest Mineral: As
is manifest in the _Air-Pump_, in which the lightest Feather, Dust, _&c._
and a piece of Lead, drop down seemingly in the same Time, from the top
to the bottom of a tall exhausted Receiver.

The rate of the Descent of heavy Bodies, according to _Galileo_, Mr.
_Huygens_, and Dr. _Halley_ (after them) is 16 Feet one Inch in one
Second of Time; and in more Seconds, as the Squares of those Times.
But in some accurate Experiments made in St. _Paul_’s _Dome_, June 9.
1710, at the Height of 220 Feet, the Descent was scarcely 14 Feet in
the first Second. The Experiments were made in the Presence of some
very considerable Members of the Royal Society, by Mr. _Hawksbee_,
their Operator, with glass, hollow Balls, some empty, some filled with
Quick-silver, the Barometer at 297, the Thermometer 60 Degrees above
Freezing. The Weight of the Balls, their Diameters, and Time of the
Descent is in this Table.

The Reason why the heavy, full Balls fell in half the Time of the hollow
ones, was the Resistence of the Air: Which Resistence is very ingeniously
and accurately assigned by Dr. _Wallis_, in _Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ. 186. And
the cause of the Resistence of all Fluids, (as Sir _Isaac Newton_, _Opt._
Q. 20.) is partly from the _Friction_ of the Parts of the Fluid, partly
from the _Inertia_ thereof. The Resistence a spherical Body meets with
from Friction, is as the right Angle under the Diameter, and the Velocity
of the moving Body: And the Resistence from the _Vis Inertia_, is as the
Square of that Product.

For a farther Account of the Properties and Proportions, _&c._ of Gravity
in the Fall or Projection of Bodies, I shall refer to the larger Accounts
of _Galilæus_, _Torricellius_, _Huygens_, Sir _Isaac Newton_, &c. or to
the shorter Accounts of Dr. _Halley_ in Philos. Trans. abridged by Mr.
_Lowthorp_, Vol. I. p. 561. or Dr. _Clarke_ in his Notes on _Rohault_,
_Phys._ 2. c. 28. §. 13, 16. And for the Resistence of Fluids, I refer to
Dr. _Wallis_ before-cited, and the _Act. Erudit. Lips._ May 1693. where
there is a way to find the Force of Mediums upon Bodies of different
Figures.

[b] That the heavenly Bodies move round their own Axes, is, beyond all
doubt, manifest to our Eye, in some of them, from the Spots visible on
them. The Spots on the Sun (easily visible with an ordinary Glass) do
manifest him to revolve round his own Axis in about 25¼ Days. The Spots
on ♃ and ♂ prove those two Planets to revolve also from East to West, as
Dr. _Hook_ discover’d in 1664, and 1665. And ♀ also (although near the
strong Rays of the Sun) hath, from some Spots, been discovered by Mr.
_Cassini_, in 1666, and 1667, to have a manifest Rotation. _V._ _Lowth.
Abridg._ Vol. 1. p. 382, and 423, 425. And such Uniformity hath the
_Creator_ observ’d in the Works of Nature, that what is observable in
one, is generally to be found in all others of the same kind. So that
since ’tis manifest the Sun, and three of his Planets whirl round, it is
very reasonable to conclude all the rest do so too, yea, every Globe of
the Universe.

[c] The Earth’s Circumference being 25031½ Miles, (according to _Book II.
Chap. 2. Note (a)._) if we divide that into 24 Hours, we shall find the
Motion of the Earth to be nearly 1043 Miles in an Hour. Which, by the by,
is a far more reasonable and less rapid Rate, than that of the Sun would
be, if we suppose the Earth to stand still, and the Sun to move round the
Earth. For according to the Proportions in _Note (e)_, of the preceding
Chapter, the Circumference of the _Magnus Orbis_ is 540686225 _English_
Miles, which divided by 24 Hours, gives 22528364 Miles in an Hour. But
what is this to the Rapidity of the fixt Stars, if we suppose them; not
the Earth, to move? Which is a good Argument for the Earth’s Motion.

[f] That there is no such Thing as _positive Levity_, but that Levity is
only a less Gravity, is abundantly manifested by the acute _Seig. Alph.

[g] I have before in _Note (a), Chap. 3._ shewn what _Vapours_ are, and
how they are rais’d. That which I shall here note, is their Quantity:
Concerning which the before-commended Dr. _Halley_ hath given us some
curious Experiments in our _Phil. Transact._ which may be met with
together in Mr. _Lowthorp_’s _Abridg._ Vol. II. _p. 108._ and _126._ Mr.
_Sedileau_ also at _Paris_ observed it for near three Years. By all their
Observations it appears, that in the Winter Months the Evaporations are
least, and greatest in Summer, and most of all in windy Weather. And by
_Monsieur Sedileau_’s Observations it appears, that what is raised in
Vapours, exceeds that which falleth in Rain. In the seven last Months of
the Year 1688, the Evaporations amounted to 22 Inches 5 Lines; but the
Rain only to Inches 6⅓ Lines: In 1689, the Evaporations were 32 Inches
10½ Lines; but the Rain 18 Inches 1 Line: In 1690, the Evaporations 30
Inches 11 Lines; the Rain 21 Inches ⅓ of a Line. _Vid._ _Mem. de Math.
Phys. Ann. 1692._ p. 25.

If it be demanded, What becomes of the Overplus of Exhalations that
descend not in Rain? I answer, They are partly tumbled down and spent by
the Winds, and partly descend in Dews, which amount to a greater quantity
than is commonly imagined. Dr. _Halley_ found the descent of Vapours in
Dews so prodigious at St. _Helena_, that he makes no doubt to attribute
the Origine of Fountains thereto. And I my self have seen in a still,
cool Evening, large thick Clouds hanging, without any Motion in the Air,
which in two or three Hours Time have been melted down by Degrees, by the
cold of the Evening, so that not any the least Remains of them have been
left.

In the foregoing Book having dispatch’d the Out-works, let us take a
Survey of the Principal Fabrick, _viz._ the _Terraqueous Globe_ it self;
a most stupendious Work in every particular of it, which doth no less
aggrandize its Maker[a], than every curious, complete Work, doth its
Workman. Let us cast our Eyes here and there, let us ransack all the
Globe, let us with the greatest Accuracy inspect every part thereof,
search out the inmost Secrets of any of the Creatures; let us examine
them with all our Gauges, measure them with our nicest Rules, pry into
them with our Microscopes, and most exquisite Instruments[b] still we
find them to bear Testimony to their infinite Workman; and that they
exceed all humane Skill so far, as that the most exquisite Copies and
Imitations of the best Artists, are no other than rude bungling Pieces
to them. And so far are we from being able to espy any Defect or Fault
in them, that the better we know them, the more we admire them; and the
farther we see into them, the more exquisite we find them to be.

CHAP. I.

_Of the Figure of the Terraqueous Globe._


This I suppose I may take for granted to be Spherical, or nearly so[a].
And this must be allowed to be the most commodious, apt Figure for a
World on many Accounts; as it is most capacious, as its Surface is
equi-distant from the Center, not only of the Globe, but at least
(nearly) of Gravity and Motion too, and as some have thought, of the
central Heat and Waters. But these, and divers other Things I shall pass
over, and insist only upon two or three other Benefits of this globous
Figure of the Earth and Waters.

1. This Figure is the most commodious in regard of Heat, and I may add of
Light also in some measure. For by this means, those two great Benefits
are uniformly and equally imparted to the World: They come harmoniously
and gradually on, and as gradually go off again. So that the daily and
yearly Returns of Light and Darkness, Cold and Heat, Moist and Dry,
are Regular and Workman-like, (we may say,) which they would not be,
especially the former, if the Mass of Earth and Waters were (as some
fancied[b] it) a large Plain; or as others, like a large Hill in the
midst of the Ocean; or of a multangular Figure; or such like.

2. This Figure is admirably adapted to the commodious and equal
Distribution of the Waters in the Globe. For since, by the Laws of
Gravity, the Waters will possess the lowest Place; therefore, if the
Mass of the Earth was cubick, prismatick, or any other angular Figure,
it would follow, that one (too vast a Part) would be drowned; and
another be too dry. But being thus orbicular, the Waters are equally
and commodiously distributed here and there, according as the Divine
Providence saw most fit; of which I shall take notice by and by.

3. The orbicular Figure of our Globe, is far the most beneficial to
the Winds and Motions of the Atmosphere. It is not to be doubted, if
the Earth was of some other, or indeed any other Figure, but that the
Currents of Air would be much retarded, if not wholly stopped. We find
by Experience what Influence large and high Mountains, Bays, Capes, and
Head-lands have upon the Winds; how they stop some, retard many, and
divert and change (near the Shores) even the _general_ and _constant
Winds_[c], that blow round the Globe in the Torrid Zone. And therefore,
since this is the effect of such little Excrescences, which have but
little Proportion to our Globe, what would be the Consequences of much
vaster Angles, which would equal a Quarter, Tenth, or but an Hundredth
Part of the Globe’s Radius? Certainly these must be such a Barricade,
as would greatly annoy, or rather absolutely stop the Currents of the
Atmosphere, and thereby deprive the World of those salutiferous Gales
that I have said keep it sweet and clean.

Thus the Figure of our Globe doth manifest it to be a Work of
Contrivance, inasmuch as it is of the most commodious Figure; and all
others would be liable to great and evident Inconveniences.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] Although the Terraqueous Globe be of an orbicular Figure, yet it is
not strictly so, 1. On account of its Hills and Vallies. But there are
inconsiderable to the Earth’s Semidiameter; for they are but as the Dust
upon a common Globe. But, 2. Our modern Astronomers assign a much greater
Variation from a globous Form, namely, that of a prolate Sphæroid, making
the Polar about 34 Miles shorter than the Equatorial Diameter. The Cause
of which they make to be the centrifugal Force of the diurnal Rotation of
the Globe.

This Figure they imagine is in _Jupiter_, his Polar being to his
Equatorial Diameter, as 39⅗ to 40⅗. But whether it be so or no, I confess
I could never perceive, although I have often viewed that Planet through
very good, and long Glasses, particularly a tolerable good one of 72 Feet
in my Hands: And although by Reason of cloudy Weather, and (at present)
_Jupiter_’s Proximity to the Sun, I have not been of late able to take a
review of that Planet; yet _Saturn_ (so far as his Ring would permit,)
and _Mars_ appear perfectly round thro’ Mr. _Huygens_’s long Glass of
126 Feet, which by Will he bequeathed, with its whole Apparatus, to our
_R. S._ by whose Favour it is now in my Hands. And moreover, I believe
it difficult, next to impossible, to measure the two Diameters to a 40ᵗʰ
Part, by reason of the smallness of _Jupiter_’s apparent Diameter, and by
reason he is moving all the time of measuring him.

As to what is alledged from lengthening the Pendulums of Clocks, to make
them keep the same Time under the Equator, as they do in our Climes; I
have shewn from the like Variations in the Air-Pump, that this may arise
from the rarity of the Air there, more than here. _V._ _Phil. Trans._
Nᵒ. 294. But if the Degrees of a Meridian grow larger, the more we go
towards the Line, (as Mr. _Cassini_ affirms they do, by an 800ᵗʰ Part in
every Degree, in _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 278.) then there is great reason to
conclude in behalf of this Sphæroidal Form.

The natural Cause of this Sphericity of our Globe, is (according to
Sir _Isaac Newton_’s Principles) that _Attraction_, which the infinite
Creator hath stamp’d on all the Matter of the Universe, whereby all
Bodies, and all the Parts of Bodies mutually attract themselves and one
another. By which means, as all the Parts of Bodies tend naturally to
their Center, so they all betake themselves to a globous Figure, unless
some other more prevalent Cause interpose. Thus Drops of Quick-silver put
on a spherical Form, the Parts thereof strongly attracting one another.
So Drops of Water have the same Form, when falling in the Air; but are
Hemispherical only when they lie on a hard Body, by reason their Gravity
doth so far over-power their self-attracting Power, as to take off one
half of their Sphericity. This Figure is commonly attributed to the
Pressure of the circumambient Air: But that this can’t be the cause, is
manifest from the Air-Pump; the case being the very same in an exhausted
Receiver, as in the open Air, and not any the least Alteration of the
Figure that I could perceive, in all the Trials I have made.

[b] It would be frivolous as well as endless to reckon up the various
Opinions of the Ancients about the Figure of the Terraqueous Globe; some
of them may be seen in _Varen. Geogr._ l. 1. _c. 3. init._ or _Johnston’s
Thaumat. c. 1. Artic. 3._ But among the variety of Opinions, one of the
principal was, That the visible Horizon was the Bounds of the Earth, and
the Ocean the Bounds of the Horizon, that the Heavens and Earth above
this Ocean, was the whole visible Universe; and that all beneath the
Ocean was _Hades_, or the _invisible World_. Hence, when the Sun set, he
was said _tingere se Oceano_; and when any went to _Hades_, they must
first pass the Ocean. Of this Opinion were not only the ancient Poets,
and others among the Heathens, but some of the Christian Fathers too,
particularly _Lactantius_, St. _Augustine_, and others, who thought their
Opinion was favoured by the Psalmist, in _Psal._ xxiv. 2. and cxxxvi. 6.
See _Bp. Usher’s Ans. to a Jes. Chall._ p. 366. _&c._

[c] _Neither do these constant ~Trade-Winds~ usually blow near the Shore,
but only on the Ocean, at least 30 or 40 Leagues off at Sea, clear from
any Land; especially on the West Coast, or Side of any Continent: For
indeed on the East Side, the Easterly Wind being the true Trade-Wind,
blows almost home to the Shore, so near as to receive a check from the
Land-Wind._ Dampier’s Winds, Ch. 1.

And not only the _general Trade-Winds_, but also the _constant coasting
Trade-Winds_, are in like manner affected by the Lands. Thus, for
Instance, on the Coast of _Angola_ and _Peru_. But this, saith the
curious Captain _Dampier_, the Reader must take notice of, _That the
Trade-Winds that blow on any Coast, except the North Coast of ~Africa~,
whether they are constant, and blow all the Year, or whether they are
shifting Winds, do never blow right in on the Shore, nor right along
Shore, but go slanting, snaking an acute Angle of about 22 Degrees.
Therefore, as the Land tends more East or West, from North or South on
the Coast; so the Winds do alter accordingly._ Ibid. Ch. 2.

_Of the Bulk of the Terraqueous Globe._


The next Thing remarkable in the Terraqueous Globe, is the prodigious
Bulk thereof[a]. A Mass of above 260 Thousand Million of Miles solid
Content. A Work too grand for any thing less than a God to make. To which
in the next Place we may add,


FOOTNOTES:

[a] It is not difficult to make a pretty near Computation of the Bulk
of the Terraqueous Globe, from those accurate Observations of a Degree
made by Mr. _Norwood_ in _England_, and Mr. _Picart_, and Mr. _Cassini_
in _France_. Whose Measures do in a surprizing manner agree. But Mr.
_Cassini_’s seeming to be the most accurate (as I have shewn in my
_Astro-Theology_, _B. 1. Ch. 2. Note (a)._) I have there made use of
his Determinations. According to which the Diameter of the Earth being
7967,72 _English_ Miles, its Ambit will be 25031½ Miles; and (supposing
it to be Spherical) its Surface will be 199444220 Miles; which being
multiplied into ⅓ of its Semidiameter, gives the Solid Content, _viz._
264856000000 Miles.




CHAP. III.

_The Motions of the Terraqueous Globe._


The Motions the Terraqueous Globe hath, are round its own Axis, and round
its Fountain of Light and Heat, the Sun[a]. That so vast a Body as the
Earth and Waters should be moved at all[b], that it should undergo two
such different Motions, as the Diurnal and Annual are, and that these
Motions should be so constantly and regularly[c] performed for near 6000
Years, without any the least Alteration ever heard of (except some Hours
which we read of in _Josh._ x. 12, 13. and in _Hezekiah_’s Time, which,
if they cannot be accounted for some other way, do greatly encrease
the Wonder[d]; these Things, I say,) do manifestly argue some divine
infinite Power to be concerned therein[e]: But especially, if to all
this we add the wonderful Convenience, yea absolute Necessity of these
Circumvolutions to the Inhabitants, yea all the Products of the Earth
and Waters. For to one of these we owe the comfortable Changes of Day
and Night; the one for Business, the other for Repose;[f] the one for
Man, and most other Animals to gather and provide Food, Habitation,
and other Necessaries of Life; the other to rest, refresh, and recruit
their Spirits[g], wasted with the Labours of the Day. To the other of
those Motions we owe the Seasons of Summer and Winter, Spring and Autumn,
together with the beneficial Instances and Effects which these have on
the Bodies and State of Animals, Vegetables, and all other Things, both
in the Torrid, Temperate, and Frigid Zones.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] With the _Copernicans_, I take it here for granted, that the Diurnal
and Annual Revolutions are the Motions of the Terraqueous Globe, not of
the Sun, _&c._ but for the Proof thereof I shall refer the Reader to the
Preface of my _Astro-Theology_, and _B. 4. Chap. 3._

is not moved by another. For it is impossible, that what moveth, and is
moved by another, should proceed_ in infinitum. Aristot. Phys. l. 8. c. 5.

indicaret, non esse ea fortuita. Ut siquis in domum aliquam, aut in

[d] We need not be sollicitous to elude the History of these Miracles,
as if they were only poetical Strains, as _Maimonides_, and some others
fancy _Joshua_’s Day to have been, _viz._ only an ordinary Summer’s
Day; but such as had the Work of many Days done in it; and therefore
by a poetical Stretch made, as if the Day had been lengthened by the
Sun standing still. But in the History they are seriously related, as
real Matters of Fact, and with such Circumstances as manifest them to
have been miraculous Works of the Almighty; And the Prophet _Habakkuk_,
iii. 11. mentions that of _Joshua_ as such. And therefore taking
them to be miraculous Perversions of the Course of Nature, instead
of being Objections, they are great Arguments of the Power of God:
For in _Hezekiah_’s Case, to wheel the Earth it self backward, or by
some extraordinary Refractions, to bring the Sun’s Shadow backward 10
Degrees: Or in _Joshua_’s Case, to stop the diurnal Course of the Globe
for some Hours, and then again give it the same Motion; to do, I say,
there Things, required the same infinite Power which at first gave the
Terraqueous Globe its Motions.

_Of the Place and Situation of the Terraqueous Globe, in respect of the
Heavenly Bodies._


Another Thing very considerable in our Globe, is its Place and Situation
at a due Distance from the Sun[a], its Fountain of Light and Heat; and
from its neighbouring Planets of the solar System, and from the fixt
Stars. But these Things I have spoken more largely of in my Survey of the
Heavens[b], and therefore only barely mention them now; to insist more
largely upon,


FOOTNOTES:

[a] It is a manifest Sign of the Creator’s Management and Care, in
placing the Terraqueous Globe at that very Distance it is from the Sun,
and contempering our own Bodies and all other Things so duly to that
Distance. For was the Earth farther from the Sun, the World would be
starved and frozen with Cold: And was it nigher we should be burnt, at
least the most combustible Things would be so, and the World would be
vexed with perpetual Conflagrations. For we see that a few of the Rays of
the Sun, even no more than what fall within the Compass of half an Inch
or an Inch in a Burning-Glass, will fire combustible Bodies, even in our
own Climate.

CHAP. V.

_The Distribution of the Earth and Waters._


The Distribution of the Waters and the dry Land, although it may seem
rude and undesigned to a careless View, and is by some taxed as such[a],
yet is admirably well adjusted to the Uses and Conveniences of our World.

For in the first Place, the Distribution is so well made, the Earth and
Waters so handsomely, so Workman-like laid, every where all the World
over, that there is a just æquipoise of the whole Globe. The _Northern_
balanceth the _Southern Ocean_, the _Atlantick_ the _Pacifick Sea_. The
_American dry Land_, is a Counterpoise to the _European_, _Asiatick_ and
_African_.

In the next Place, the Earth and the Waters are so admirably well placed
about in the Globe, as to be helpful to one another, to minister to one
another’s Uses. The great Oceans, and the lesser Seas and Lakes, are
so admirably well distributed throughout the Globe[b], as to afford
sufficient Vapours[c] for Clouds and Rains, to temperate the Cold[c] of
the Northern frozen Air, to cool and mitigate the Heats[d] of the Torrid
Zone, and to refresh the Earth with fertile Showers; yea, in some measure
to minister fresh Waters to the Fountains and Rivers. Nay, so abundant
is this great Blessing, which the most indulgent Creator hath afforded
us by means of this Distribution of the Waters I am speaking of, that
there is more than a scanty, bare Provision, or mere Sufficiency; even a
Plenty, a Surplusage of this useful Creature of God, (the fresh Waters)
afforded to the World; and they so well ordered, as not to drown the
Nations of the Earth, nor to stagnate, stink, and poison, or annoy them;
but to be gently carried through convenient Chanels back again to their
grand Fountain[e] the Sea; and many of them through such large Tracts
of Land, and to such prodigious Distances, that it is a great Wonder
the Fountains should be high enough[f], or the Seas low enough, ever
to afford so long a Conveyance. Witness the _Danube_[g] and _Wolga_ of
_Europe_, the _Nile_[h] and the _Niger_[i] of _Africk_, the _Ganges_[k]
and _Euphrates_ of _Asia_, and the _Amazons River_[l] and _Rio de la
Plata_ of _America_, and many others which might be named; some of which
are said to run above 5000 Miles, and some no less than 6000 from their
Fountains to the Sea. And indeed such prodigious Conveyances of the
Waters make it manifest, that no accidental Currents and Alterations of
the Waters themselves, no Art or Power of Man, nothing less than the
_Fiat_ of the Almighty, could ever have made, or found, so long and
commodious Declivities, and Chanels for the Passage of the Waters.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] The most eminent Author I have met with, that finds fault with the
Distribution of the Earth and Waters, and indeed with the whole present
Structure of the Globe, is the learned and eloquent Theorist, Dr.
_Burnet_, who frequently exclaims on this Point, _Tellus nostra, si totam
simul complectamur, non est ordinata & venusta rerum compages——sed moles
aggesta vario, incertoque situ partium, nullâ ordinis aut venustatis
habitâ ratione._ Theor. Sacr. l. 1. c. 7. _Ecquis autem à Deo hæc ita
facta? ~&c.~_ ib. _Quo autem Herculeo labore opus effet ad excavandum
terram in tantum hiatum?——Si immediatè à causâ primâ effectus fuisset
hic alveus, aliquem saltem ordinem, mensuram, & proportionem notare
voluisset in ipsius formâ, & partium dispositione;——sed confusa omnia,
~&c.~_ ib. c. 8. _Tellus nostra cùm exigua sit, est etiam rudis: Et in
illâ exiguitate multa sunt superflua, multa inelegantia. Dimidiam terræ
superficiem inundat Oceanus; magnâ ex parte, ut mihi videtur, inutilis._
And then he goes on to shew how this Part of the Creation might be
mended, _ib._ c. 10. All this is to me surprizing from an Author of
great Ingenuity, who seems in his Book to have a just Opinion of, and
due Veneration for God. But certainly such Notions are very inconsistent
with the Belief of God’s creating, especially his governing and ordering
the World. But suppose the Terraqueous Globe was such a rude, confused,
inconvenient Mass, as he pretends, yet it is well enough for a sinful
World. But besides, what others have long ago abundantly answered, the
following Survey, will, I hope, sufficiently manifest it to be the Work
of a wise and beneficent, as well as omnipotent Creator.

[b] Some have objected against the Distribution of the Earth and Waters,
as if the Waters occupied too large a part of the Globe, which they
think would be of greater Use, if it was dry Land. But then they do not
consider that this would deprive the World of a due Quantity of Vapours
and Rain. For if the Cavities which contain the Sea, and other Waters,
were deeper, although the Waters were no less in Quantity, only their
Surfaces narrower and lesser, the Evaporations would be so much the
less, inasmuch as those Evaporations are made from the Surface, and are,
consequently, in proportion to the Surface, not the Depth or Quantity of
Water.

[c] I took notice before in _Book I. Chap. 3. Note (a)._ That the Vapours
constituting Clouds and Rain, are _Vesiculæ_ of Water detached by Heat.
The manner of which I conceive to be thus; Heat being of an agile Nature,
or the lightest of all Bodies, easily breaks loose from them; and if they
are humid, in its Passage, carries along with it Particles, or little
Cases of the Water; which being lighter than Air, are buoyed up thereby,
and swim in it; until by knocking against one another, or being thickened
by the Cold, (as in the Note before-cited,) they are reduced into Clouds
and Drops.

Having mentioned the manner how Vapours are raised, and there being more
room here than in the Note before-cited, I shall, for the Illustration of
Natures Process, take notice of three Things observable to our purpose,
in Water over the Fire. 1. That the Evaporations are proportional to the
Heat ascending out of the Water. A small Heat throws off but few Vapours,
scarce visible: A greater Heat, and ascending in greater Quantities,
carries off grosser, larger, and more numerous _Vesiculæ_, which we call
a _Steam_: And if the Heat breaks through the Water with such a Fury, as
to lacerate and lift up great Quantities or Bubbles of Water, too heavy
for the Air to carry or buoy up, it causeth what we call _Boyling_. And
the Particles of Water thus mounted up by the Heat, are visible Sphærules
of Water, if viewed with a Microscope, as they swim about in a Ray of
the Sun let into a dark Room, with warm Water underneath; where some of
the Vapours appear large, some smaller Sphærules, according (no doubt)
to the larger and lesser Quantities of Heat blowing them up and carrying
them off. 2. If these Vapours be intercepted in their Ascent by any
Context, especially cold Body, as Glass, Marble, _&c._ they are thereby
reduced into Drops, and Masses of Water, like those of Rain, _&c._ 3.
These Vapours in their Ascent from the Water, may be observed, in cold
frosty Weather, either to rise but a little above the Water, and there
to hang, or to glide on a little above its Surface: Or if the Weather be
very cold, after a little ascent, they may be seen to fall back again
into the Water; in their Ascent and Descent describing a Curve somewhat
like that of an Arrow from a Bow. But in a warmer Air, and still, the
Vapours ascend more nimbly and copiously, mounting up aloft, till they
are out of Sight. But if the Air be warm and windy too, the Vapours are
sooner carried out of Sight, and make way for others. And accordingly
I have often observed, that hot Liquors, if not set too thin, and not
frequently stirred, cool slower in the greatest Frosts, than in temperate
Weather, especially if windy. And it is manifest by good Experiments,
that the Evaporations are less at those times than these; less by far in
the Winter than the warmer Months.

[c] As our Northern Islands are observed to be more temperate than our
Continents, (of which we had a notable Instance in the great Frost in
1708/9, which _Ireland_ and _Scotland_ felt less of, than most Parts
of _Europe_ besides; of which see _Book IV. Chap. 12. Note (c)._) so
this Temperature is owing to the warm Vapours afforded chiefly by the
Sea, which by the preceding Note must necessarily be warm, as they are
Vapours, or Water inflated by Heat.

The Cause of this Heat I take to be partly that of the Sun, and partly
Subterraneous. That it is not wholly that of the Sun, is manifest from
Vapours, being as, or more copiously raised when the Sun Beams are
weakest, as when strongest, there being greater Rains and Winds at the
one time than the other. And that there is such a thing as _Subterraneous
Heat_, (whether Central, or from the meeting of Mineral Juices; or
such as is Congenial or Connatural to our Globe, I have not Time to
enquire; but I say, that such a Thing is,) is evident not only from the
Hot-Baths, many fiery Erruptions and Explosions, _&c._ but also from the
ordinary Warmth of Cellars and Places under Ground, which are not barely
comparatively warm, but of sufficient Heat to raise Vapours also: As is
manifest from the smoking of perennial Fountains in frosty Weather, and
Water drawn out of Pumps and open Wells at such a Time. Yea, even Animals
themselves are sensible of it, as particularly _Moles_, who dig before
a Thaw, and against some other Alterations of the Weather; excited, no
doubt, thereunto by the same warm Vapours arising in the Earth, which
animate them, as well as produce the succeeding Changes of the Weather.

[d] Besides the _Trade-Winds_, which serve to mitigate the excessive
Heats in the Torrid Zone; the Clouds are a good Screen against the
scorching Sun-Beams, especially when the Sun passeth their Zenith; at
which Time is their Winter, or coolest Season, by reason they have then
most Clouds and Rain. For which Service, that which _Varene_ takes notice
of, is a great Providence of God, _viz._ _Pleraque loca Zonæ Torridæ
vicinum habent mare, ut India, Insulæ Indicæ, Lingua Africæ, Guinea,
Brasilia, Peruvia, Mexicana, Hispania: Pauca loca Zonæ Torridæ sunt
Mediterranea._ Varenii. Geogr. l. 2. c. 26. Prop. 10. §. 7.

[e] That Springs have their Origine from the Sea, and not from Rains and
Vapours, among many other strong Reasons, I conclude from the Perennity
of divers Springs, which always afford the same quantity of Water. Of
this sort there are many to be found every where. But I shall, for an
Instance, single out one in the Parish of _Upminster_, where I live,
as being very proper for my purpose, and one that I have had better
Opportunities of making Remarks upon above twenty Years. This in the
greatest Droughts is little, if at all diminished, that I could perceive
by my Eye, although the Ponds all over the Country, and an adjoining
Brook have been dry for many Months together; as particularly in the dry
Summer Months of the Year 1705. And in the wettest Seasons, such as the
Summer and other Months were, preceding the violent Storm in _November_
1703. (_Vid._ _Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ. 289.) I say, in such wet Seasons I
have not observed any Increment of its Stream, excepting only for violent
Rains falling therein, or running down from the higher Land into it;
which discoloureth the Waters oftentimes, and makes an increase of only
a Day’s, or sometimes but a few Hours Continuance. But now, if this
Spring had its Origine from Rain and Vapours, there would be an increase
and decrease of the one, as there should happen to be of the other: As
actually it is in such temporary Springs as have undoubtedly their Source
from Rain and Vapours.

But besides this, another considerable Thing in this _Upminster_ Spring
(and Thousands of others) is, that it breaks out of so inconsiderable
an Hillock, or Eminence of Ground, that can have no more Influence in
the Condensation of the Vapours, or stopping the Clouds, (which the
Maintainers of this Hypothesis suppose) than the lower Lands about it
have. By some Critical Observations I made with a very nice portable
Barometer, I found that my House stands between 80 and 90 Feet higher
than the Low-Water Mark in the River of _Thames_, nearest me; and that
part of the River being scarce thirty Miles from the Sea, I guess, (and
am more confirmed from some later Experiments I made nearer the Sea)
that we cannot be much above 100 Feet above the Sea. The Spring I judge
nearly level with, or but little higher than where my House stands; and
the Lands from whence it immediately issues, I guess about 15 or 20 Feet
higher than the Spring: and the Lands above that, of no very remarkable
Height. And indeed, by actual Measure, one of the highest Hills I have
met with in _Essex_, is but 363 Feet high; (_Vid._ _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ.
313. _p. 16._) and I guess by some very late Experiments I made, neither
that, nor any other Land in _Essex_, to be above 400 Feet above the Sea.
Now what is so inconsiderable a rise of Land to a perennial Condensation
of Vapours, fit to maintain even so inconsiderable a Fountain, as what I
have mentioned is? Or indeed the High-lands of the whole large County of
_Essex_, to the maintaining of all its Fountains and Rivulets?

But I shall no farther prosecute this Argument, but refer to the late
learned, curious and industrious Dr. _Plot_’s _Tentamen Phil. de Orig.
Font._ in which he hath fully discussed this Matter.

As to the manner how the Waters are raised up into the Mountains and
Higher Lands, an easy and natural Representation may be made of it, by
putting a little Heap of Sand, Ashes, or a little Loaf of Bread, _&c._
in a Bason of Water; where the Sand will represent the dry Land, or an
Island, and the Bason of Water the Sea about it. And as the Water in the
Bason riseth to, or near the top of the Heap in it, so doth the Waters
of the Sea, Lakes, _&c._ rise in the Hills. Which case I take to be the
same with the ascent of Liquids in capillary Tubes, or between contiguous
Planes, or in a Tube filled with Ashes: Of which the industrious and
compleat Artificer in Air-Pumps, Mr. _Hawksbee_, hath given us some, not
contemptible Experiments, in his _Phys. Mech. Exp._ pag. 139.

Among the many Causes assigned for this ascent of Liquors, there are two
that bid the fairest for it, _viz._ _the Pressure of the Atmosphere_,
and the _Newtonian Attraction_. That it is not the former, appears from
the Experiments succeeding, as well, or better in _Vacuo_, than in the
open Air, the ascent being rather swifter in _Vacuo_. This then being not
the Cause, I shall suppose the other is; but for the Proof thereof, I
shall refer to some of our late _English_ Authors, especially some very
late Experiments made before our most famous _R. S._ which will be so
well improved by some of that illustrious Body, as to go near to put the
Matter out of doubt.

CHAP. VI.

_The great Variety and Quantity of all Things upon, and in the
Terraqueous Globe, provided for the Uses of the World._


The last Remark I shall make about the Terraqueous Globe in general is,
the great Variety of Kinds, or Tribes, as well as prodigious Number of
Individuals of each various Tribe, there is of all Creatures[a]. There
are so many Beasts, so many Birds, so many Insects, so many Reptiles, so
many Trees, so many Plants upon the Land; so many Fishes, Sea-Plants, and
other Creatures in the Waters; so many Minerals, Metals, and Fossiles in
the Subterraneous Regions; so many _Species_ of these _Genera_, so many
_Individuals_ of those _Species_, that there is nothing wanting to the
Use of Man, or any other Creature of this lower World. If every Age doth
change its Food, its way of Cloathing, its way of Building; if every
Age[b] hath its Variety of Diseases; nay, if Man, or any other Animal,
was minded to change these Things every Day, still the Creation would
not be exhausted, still nothing would be wanting for Food, nothing for
Physick, nothing for Building and Habitation, nothing for Cleanliness and
Refreshment, yea, even for Recreation and Pleasure. But the Munificence
of the Creator is such, that there is abundantly enough to supply the
Wants, the Conveniencies, yea, almost the Extravagancies of all the
Creatures, in all Places, all Ages, and upon all Occasions.

And this may serve to answer an Objection against the Excellency of, and
Wisdom shewed in the Creation; namely, What need of so many Creatures[c]?
Particularly of so many Insects, so many Plants, and so many other
Things? And especially of some of them, that are so far from being
useful, that they are very noxious; some by their Ferity, and others by
their poisonous Nature, _&c._?

To which I might answer, that in greater Variety, the greater Art is
seen; that the fierce, poisonous, and noxious Creatures serve as Rods and
Scourges to chastise us[d], as means to excite our Wisdom, Care, and
Industry, with more to the same purpose. But these Things have been fully
urged by others; and it is sufficient to say, that this great Variety is
a most wise Provision for all the Uses of the World in all Ages and all
Places. Some for Food, some for Physick[e], some for Habitation, some for
Utensils, some for Tools and Instruments of Work, and some for Recreation
and Pleasure, either to Man, or to some of the inferior Creatures
themselves; even for which inferior Creatures, the liberal Creator hath
provided all Things necessary, or any ways conducing to their happy,
comfortable living in this World, as well as for Man.

And it is manifest, that all the Creatures of God, Beasts, Birds,
Insects, Plants, and every other _Genus_ have, or may have, their
several Uses even among Men. For although in one Place many Things may
lie neglected, and out of Use, yet in other Places they may be of great
Use. So what hath seemed useless in one Age, hath been received in
another; as all the new Discoveries in Physick, and all the Alterations
in Diet do sufficiently witness. Many Things also there are which in one
Form may be pernicious to Man; but in another, of great Use. There are
many Plants[f], many Animals, many Minerals, which in one Form destroy,
in another heal. The _Cassada Plant_ unprepared poisoneth, but prepared,
is the very Bread of the _West-Indies_[g]. _Vipers_ and _Scorpions_, and
many Minerals, as destructive as they are to Man, yet afford him some of
his best Medicines.

Or if there be many Things of little, immediate Use to Man, in this, or
any other Age; yet to other Creatures they may afford Food or Physick,
or be of some necessary Use. How many Trees and Plants, nay, even the
very Carcases of Animals, yea, the very Dust of the Earth[h], and the
most refuse, contemptible Things to be met with; I say, how many such
Things are either Food, or probably Medicine to many Creatures, afford
them Retreat, are Places of Habitation, or Matrixes for their Generation,
as shall be shewed in proper Place? The prodigious Swarms of Insects in
the Air, and in the Waters, (many of which may be perhaps at present of
no great Use to Man) yet are Food to Birds, Fishes, Reptiles, Insects
themselves, and other Creatures[i], for whose happy and comfortable
Subsistence, I have said the bountiful Creator hath liberally provided,
as well as for that of Man.

[c] This was no very easy Question to be answered by such as held,
that _all Things were made for Man_, as most of the Ancients did; as
_Aristotle_, _Seneca_, _Cicero_ and _Pliny_, (to name only some of the
chief). And _Cicero_ cites it as the celebrated _Chrysippus_’s Opinion,
_Præclare enim Chrysippus, Cætera nata esse Hominum Causâ, & Deorum._
_De fin. bon. & mal. l. 3._ And in his _De Nat. Deor. l. 2. fin._ he
seriously proves the World it self to have been made for the Gods and
Man, and all Things in the World to have been made and contrived for the
Benefit of Man (_parata & inventa ad fructum Hominum_, are his Words).
So _Pliny_ in his Preface to his 7ᵗʰ Book saith, Nature made all Things
for Man; but then he makes a doubt, whether she shewed her self a more
indulgent Parent, or cruel Step-Mother, as in _Book IV. Chap. 12. Note
(b)._ But since the Works of God have been more discovered, and the
Limits of the Universe have been found to be of infinitely greater Extent
than the Ancients supposed them; this narrow Opinion hath been exploded.
And the Answer will be found easy to these Questions, Why so many useless
Creatures? In the Heavens, Why so many fixt Stars, and the greatest part
of them scarce visible? Why such Systems of Planets, as in _Jupiter_,
_Saturn_, &c. (See my _Astro-Theology_.) In the Earth and Waters, Why so
many Creatures of no use to Man?

But although the infinitely wise Creator hath put it in the Power of
such vile Animals to chastise us, yet hath he shewed no less Wisdom and
Kindness in ordering many, if not most of them so, as that it shall be in
the Power of Man, and other Creatures to obviate or escape their Evils.
For, besides the noble Antidotes afforded by Minerals, Vegetables, _&c._
many, if not most of our _European_ venemous Animals carry their Cure,
as well as Poison, in their own Bodies. The Oil, and I doubt not, the
Body of _Scorpions_ too, is a certain Remedy against its Stroke. A _Bee_,
_Wasp_, or _Hornet_ crushed and rubbed, and bound upon the Place, I have
always found to be a certain Cure for the Sting of those Creatures. And
I question not, but the Flesh, especially the Head of _Vipers_, would be
found a Remedy for their Bites.

_Our Viper-Catchers have a Remedy in which they place so great
Confidence, as to be no more afraid of the Bite ~[of a Viper]~, than
of a common Puncture, immediately curing themselves by the Application
of their Specifick. This though they keep a great Secret, I have upon
strict Enquiry found to be no other than ~Axungia Viperina~, presently
rubbed into the Wound._ This Remedy the learned Doctor tried himself with
good Success in a young Dog that was bitten in the Nose. _Vid._ _Mead of
Poisons_, p. 29.

And as to the means to escape the Mischief of such noxious Animals,
besides what may be effected by the Care, Industry and Sagacity of Man;
some of them are so contrived and made, as to give Warning or Time to
Creatures in danger from them. Thus, for Instance, the _Rattle-Snake_,
the most poisonous of any Serpent, who darts its poisonous Vapours to
some distance, and in all Probability was the _Basilisk_ of the Ancients,
said to kill with its Eyes, this involuntarily gives warning by the
Rattle in its Tail. So the _Shark_, the most rapacious Animal of the
Waters, is forced to turn himself on his Back, (and thereby gives an
Opportunity of Escape) before he can catch his Prey.

[f] Among poisonous Vegetables, none more famous of old than _Hemlock_,
accounted at this Day also very dangerous to Man, of which there are some
dismal Examples in our _Phil. Trans. Wepfer_, &c. But yet this Plant is
Food for _Goats_, and its Seeds to _Bustards_; and as _Galen_ saith, to
_Starlings_ also. Neither is this, so pernicious a Plant, only Food, but
also Physick to some Animals. An Horse troubled with the _Farcy_, and
could not be cured with the most famed Remedies, cured himself of it
in a short Time, by eating _Hemlock_, of which he eat greedily. _Vid._
_Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 231. _And a Woman which was cured of the Plague, but

And not only _Hemlock_, but many other, if not most Plants accounted
poisonous, may have their great Use in Medicine: Of which take the
Opinion of an able Judge, my ingenious and learned Friend Dr. _Tancred
Robinson_, in a Letter I have of his to the late great Mr. _Ray_, of
Nov. 7. 1604, viz. _According to my Promise, I here send you a few
Observations concerning some Plants, seldom used in Medicine, being
esteemed poisonous, which if truly corrected, or exactly dosed, may
perhaps prove the most powerful and effectual Medicines yet known._
Having then given an Account of some of their Correctives, he gives
these following Examples, _viz._ _1. The Hellebores incorporated with
a Sapo, or Alkaly-Salts alone, are successful Remedies in Epilepsies,
Vertigo’s, Palsies, Lethargies, and Mania’s. Dos. a ℈j. to ʒss. 2. The
Radic. Assari, Cicutæ, and the Napellus, in Agues and periodical Pains.
Dos. ℈j. to ʒss. 3. The Hyoscyamus in Hæmorrhagies, violent Heats and
Perturbation of the Blood, and also in all great Inflammations. Dos.
℈j. to ʒss. 4. The Semen Stramonia is a very good Anodyne, useful in
Vigilia’s, Rheumatisms, Hysterick Cases, in all the Orgasms of the Blood
or Spirits, and where-ever there is an Indication for a Paregorick. Dos.
℈j. to ʒss. 5. Elaterium thus corrected, may be given from gr. x. to xv.
in Hydropical Cases, without any sensible Evacuation or Disturbance. So
may the Soldanella and Gratiola in greater Doses. 6. Opium corrected
as afore-mentioned, loses its Narcotick Faculty, and may be given
very safely in great Doses, and proves more than usually prevalent in
Convulsive Cases, Fluxes, Catarrhs, and all painful Paroxysms, ~&c.~_

_Of the Terraqueous Globe in particular, more especially the Earth._


Having thus taken a general Prospect of our Terraqueous Globe, I shall
in this Book come to its Particulars. But here we have such an immense
Variety presenting it self to our Senses, and such amazing Strokes of
Power and Wisdom, that it is impossible not to be at a Stand, and very
difficult to know where to begin, how to proceed, or where to end. But we
must however attempt.

And for the more clear and regular proceeding on this copious Subject, I
shall distribute the Globe into its own grand constituent Parts.

I. The _Earth_ and its Appurtenances.

II. The _Waters_ and Theirs.

The first of these only, is what at present I shall be able to take into
this Survey.

And in Surveying the _Earth_, I intend,

1. To consider its constituent Parts, or Things peculiar to its self.

2. The Inhabitants thereof, or the several Kinds of Creatures that have
their Habitation, Growth, or Subsistence thereon.

1. As to the Earth it self, the most remarkable Things that present
themselves to our View, are,

1. Its various Moulds and Soils.

2. Its several Strata, or Beds.

3. Its very Subterraneous Passages, Grotto’s and Caverns.

4. Its Mountains and Vallies.




CHAP. I.

_Of the Soils and Moulds in the Earth._


The various Soils and Moulds are an admirable and manifest Contrivance
of the All-wise Creator, in making this Provision for the various
Vegetables[a], and divers other Uses of the Creatures. For, as some
Trees, some Plants, some Grains dwindle and die in a disagreeable Soil,
but thrive and flourish in others; so the All-wise Creator hath amply
provided for every Kind a proper Bed.

If some delight in a warm, some a cold Soil; some in a lax or sandy,
some a heavy or clayie Soil; some in a Mixture of both, some in this, and
that and the other Mould, some in moist, some in dry Places[b]; still we
find Provision enough for all these Purposes: Every Country abounding
with its proper Trees and Plants[c], and every Vegetable flourishing and
gay, somewhere or other about the Globe, and abundantly answering the
Almighty Command of the Creator, when the Earth and Waters were ordered
to their peculiar Place, _Gen._ i. 11. _And God said, Let the Earth bring
forth Grass, the Herb yielding Seed, and the Tree yielding Fruit after
his kind._ All which we actually see is so.

To this Convenience which the various Soils that coat the Earth are of to
the Vegetables, we may add their great Use and Benefit to divers Animals,
to many Kinds of Quadrupeds, Fowls, Insects, and Reptiles, who make in
the Earth their Places of Repose and Rest, their Retreat in Winter, their
Security from their Enemies, and their Nests to repose their Young; some
delighting in a lax and pervious Mould, admitting them an easy Passage;
and others delighting in a firmer and more solid Earth, that will better
secure them against Injuries from without.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] It is not to be doubted, that although Vegetables delight in peculiar
Soils, yet they owe not their Life and Growth to the Earth it self, but
to some agreeable Juices or Salts, _&c._ residing in the Earth. Of this
the great Mr. _Boyl_ hath given us some good Experiments. He ordered his
Gardener to dig up, and dry in an Oven some Earth fit for the Purpose,
to weigh it, and to set therein some _Squash Seeds_, (a kind of _Indian_
Pompion). The Seeds when sown were watered with Rain or Spring-water
only. But although a Plant was produced in one Experiment of near 3 _l._
and in another of above 14 _l._ yet the Earth when dried, and weighed
again, was scarce diminished at all in its Weight.

Another Experiment he alledges is of _Helmont_’s, who dried 200 _l._ of
Earth, and therein planted a Willow weighing 5 _l._ which he watered with
Rain or distilled Water: And to secure it from any other Earth getting
in, he covered it with a perforated Tin Cover. After five Years, weighing
the Tree with all the Leaves it had born in that time, he found it to
weigh 169 _l._ 3 Ounces, but the Earth to be diminished only about 2
Ounces in its weight. _Vid._ _Boyl’s Scept. Chym._ Part 2. _pag. 114._

CHAP. II.

_Of the various Strata or Beds observable in the Earth._


The various _Strata_ or _Beds_, although but little different from the
last, yet will deserve a distinct Consideration.

By the _Strata_ or _Beds_, I mean those Layers of Minerals[a], Metals[b],
Earth, and Stone[c], lying under that upper _Stratum_, or Tegument of
the Earth last spoken of, all of a prodigious Use to Mankind: Some being
of great Use for Building; some serving for Ornament; some furnishing
us with commodious Machines, and Tools to prepare our Food, and for
Vessels and Utensils, and for multitudes of other Uses; some serving
for Firing to dress our Food, and to guard us against the Insults of
Cold and Weather; some being of great Use in Physick, in Exchange and
Commerce, in manuring and fertilizing our Lands, in dying and colouring,
and ten thousand other Conveniences, too many to be particularly spoken
of: Only there is one grand Use of one of these Strata or Beds, that
cannot easily be omitted, and that is, those subterraneous Strata of
Sand, Gravel, and laxer Earth that admit of, and facilitate the Passage
of the sweet Waters[d], and may probably be the Colanders whereby they
are sweetened, and then at the same time also convey’d to all Parts of
the habitable World, not only through the temperate and torrid Zones, but
even the farthest Regions of the frozen Poles.

That these Strata are the _principal Passages_ of the sweet
Fountain-Waters, is, I think not to be doubted, considering that in them
the Waters are well known to pass, and in them the Springs are found by
those that seek for them. I say, the principal Passages, because there
are other subterraneous Guts and Chanels, Fissures and Passages, through
which many Times the Waters make their way.

Now that which in a particular manner doth seem to me to manifest a
special Providence of God in the repositing these watery Beds is, that
they should be dispersed all the World over, into all Countries, and
almost all Tracts of Land: That they should so entirely, or for the
most part, consist of lax, incohering Earth, and be so seldom blended
with other impervious Moulds, or if they are so, it is commonly but
accidentally; and that they are interposed between the other impervious
Beds, and so are as a Prop and Pillar to guard them off, and to prevent
their sinking in and shutting up the Passages of the Waters.

The Time when those Strata were laid, was doubtless at the Creation, when
_God said_ (Gen. i. 9.) _Let the Waters under the Heaven be gathered
together unto one Place, and let the dry Land appear_; or else at the
Deluge, if, with some sagacious Naturalists, we suppose the Globe of
Earth to have been dissolved by the Flood[e]. At that Time (whatever it
was) when the terraqueous Globe was in a chaotick State, and the earthy
Particles subsided, then those several Beds were in all Probability
reposited in the Earth, in that commodious Order in which they now are
found; and that, as is asserted, according to the Laws[f] of Gravity.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] Altho’ Minerals, Metals and Stones lie in Beds, and have done so
ever since _Noah_’s Flood, if not from the Creation; yet it is greatly
probable that they have Power of _growing_ in their respective Beds:
That as the Beds are robbed and emptied by Miners, so after a while they
recruit again. Thus _Vitriol_, Mr. _Boyl_ thinks, will grow by the Help
of the Air. So _Alum_ doth the same. _We are assured_ (he saith) _by the
experienced ~Agricola~, That the Earth or Ore of ~Alum~, being robbed of
its Salt, will in tract of Time recover it, by being exposed to the Air._
_~Boyl~’s_ Suspic. about some Hid. Qual. in the Air, p. 18.

[b] As to the Growth of _Metals_, there is great Reason to suspect that
also, from what Mr. _Boyl_ hath alledged in his _Observations about the
Growth of Metals_: And in his _Scept. Chym. Part 6. pag. 362._ Compare
also _Hakewil_’s _Apol. pag. 164._

And particularly as to the Growth of _Iron_, to the Instances he gives
from _Pliny_, _Fallopius_, _Cæsalpinus_, and others; we may add, what
is well known in the _Forest of Dean_ in _Gloucestershire_: That the
best Iron, and most in Quantity, that is found there, is in the old
Cinders, which they melt over again. This is the Author of the _Additions
to Gloucestershire in Cambd. Brit._ of the last Edition, _p. 245._
attributes to the Remissness of the former Melters, in not exhausting
the Ore: But in all Probability it is rather to be attributed to the new
Impregnations of the old Ore, or Cinders, from the Air, or from some
seminal Principle, or plastick Quality in the Ore it self.

[c] As for the Growth of _Stone_, Mr. _Boyl_ gives two Instances. One
is that famous Place in _France_, called _Les Caves Goutieres: Where
the Water falling from the upper Parts of the Cave to the Ground, doth
presently there condense into little Stones, of such Figures as the
Drops, falling either severally, or upon one another, and coagulating
presently into Stones, chance to exhibit_. Vid. Scept. Chym. pag. 360.

Such like Caves as these I have my self met with in _England_;
particularly on the very Top of _Bredon-Hill_ in _Worcestershire_,
near the _Precipice_, facing _Pershore_, in or near the old Fortress,
called _Bembsbury-Camp_; I saw some Years ago such a Cave, which (if I
mis-remember not) was lined with those _Stalactical Stones_ on the Top
and Sides. On the Top they hung like Icicles great and small, and many
lay on the Ground. They seemed manifestly to be made by an Exsudation,
or Exstillation of some petrifying Juices out of the rocky Earth there.
On the Spot, I thought it might be from the Rains soaking through, and
carrying with it Impregnations from the Stone, the Hill being there all
rocky. Hard by the Cave is one or more vast Stones, which (if I mistake
not) are incrustated with this Sparry, Stalactical Substance, if not
wholly made of it. But it is so many Years ago since I was at the Place,
and not being able to find my Notes about it, I cannot say whether the
whole Stone is (in all Probability) Spar, (as I think it is,) or whether
I found it only cased over with it, notwithstanding I was very nice in
examining it then, and have now some of the Fragments by me, consisting,
among other shining Parts, of some transparent angular ones.

The other Instance of Mr. _Boyl_, is from _Linschoten_, who saith, that
in the _East-Indies_, when they have cleared the Diamond Mines of all the
Diamonds, _In a few Years Time they find in the same Place new Diamonds
produced._ Boyl. Ibid.

[d] It is not only agreeable to Reason, but I am told by Persons
conversant in digging of Wells throughout this County of _Essex_, where
I live, that the surest Beds in which they find Water, are _Gravel_, and
a coarse, dark coloured _Sand_; which Beds seldom fail to yield Plenty
of sweet Water: But for _Clay_, they never find Water therein, if it be
a strong, stiff _Clay_; but if it be lax and sandy, sometimes Springs
are found in it; yet so weak, that they will scarcely serve the Uses
of the smallest Family. And sometimes they meet with those Beds lying
next, under a loose, black Mould, (which, by their Description, I judged
to be a sort of oazy, or to have the Resemblance of an ancient, rushy
Ground,) and in that Case the Water is always naught, and stinks. And
lastly, Another sort of Bed they find in _Essex_, in the clayie-Lands,
particularly that part called the _Rodings_, which yields Plenty of sweet
Water, and that is a Bed of white Earth, as though made of Chalk and
white Sand. This they find, after they have dug through forty, or more
Feet of Clay; and it is so tender and moist, that it will not lie upon
the Spade, but they are forced to throw it into their Bucket with their
Hands, or with Bowls; but when it comes up into the Air, it soon becomes
an hard white Stone.

Thus much for the Variety of Beds wherein the Waters are found. That it
is in these Beds only or chiefly the Springs run, is farther manifest
from the forcible Eruption of the Waters sometimes out of those watery
Beds. Of which see _Chap. 4. Note (k)._ This Eruption shews, that the
Waters come from some Eminence or other, lying at a Distance, and being
closely pent up within the _watery Stratum_, by the clayie Strata, the
Waters with force mount up, when the Strata above are opened.

[e] _V._ Dr. _Woodward_’s Essay, Part 2. _Steno_’s Prodr. _&c._

[f] Id. ib. _pag. 28._ and _74._ But Dr. _Leigh_ in his _Nat. History
of Lancashire_, speaking of the Coal-pits, denies the Strata to lie
according to the Laws of Gravitation, saying the Strata are a Bed of
_Marle_, afterwards _Free-Stone_, next _Iron-Stone_, then _Coal_, or
_Kennel-Mine_, then some other Strata, and again _Coal_, _&c._

But upon a stricter Enquiry into the Matter, finding I had reason to
suspect that few, if any, actually had tried the Experiment, I was minded
to bring the Thing to the Test of Experiment my self; and having an
Opportunity, on _April 11. 1712._ I caused divers Places to be bored,
laying the several _Strata_ by themselves; which afterwards I weighed
with all Strictness, first in Air, then in Water, taking Care that no
Air-bubbles, _&c._ might obstruct the Accuracy of the Experiment. The
Result was, that in my Yard, the Strata were gradually specifically
heavier and heavier, the lower and lower they went; and the upper which
was Clay, was considerably specifically lighter than the lower _Stratum_;
which was first a loose Sand, then a Gravel. In which _Stratum_
principally the Springs run that supply my Well.

But in my Fields, where three Places were bored (to no great Depth) I
found below the upper (superficial _Stratum_) a deep Bed of Sand only,
which was of different Colours and Consistence, which I weighed as
before, together with the Virgin-Mould; but they were all of the same,
or nearly the same specifick Gravity, both out of the same Hole, and out
of different Holes, although the Sand was at last so gravelly, that it
hinder’d our boring any deeper.

Upon this, fearing lest some Error might be in the former Experiments, I
try’d them over again; and that with the same Success.

After this, I made some Experiments in some deep Chalk-Pits, with the
Flints, Chalk, _&c._ above and below; but the Success was not so uniform
as before.

Acquainting our justly renowned _R. S._ with these Experiments, they
ordered their Operator to experiment the _Strata_ of a Coal-Pit; the
Success whereof may be seen in _Philos. Trans. Nr. 336_.




CHAP. III.

_Of the Subterraneous Caverns, and the Vulcano’s._


I shall take notice of the subterraneous Caverns, Grotto’s and Vulcano’s,
because they are made an Objection[a] against the present Contrivance
and Structure of the Globe. But, if well considered, they will be found
to be wise Contrivances of the Creator, serving to great Uses of the
Globe, and Ends of God’s Government. Besides many secret, grand Functions
and Operations of Nature in the Bowels of the Earth, that in all
Probability these Things may minister unto, they are of great Use to the
Countries where they are[b]. To instance in the very worst of the Things
named, _viz._ the _Vulcano’s_ and ignivomous Mountains; although they
are some of the most terrible Shocks of the Globe, and dreadful Scourges
of the sinful Inhabitants thereof, and may serve them as Emblems, and
Presages of Hell it self; yet even these have their great Uses too, being
as Spiracles or Tunnels[c] to the Countries where they are, to vent the
Fire and Vapours that would make dismal Havock, and oftentimes actually
do so, by dreadful Succussions and Convulsions of the Earth. Nay, if the
Hypothesis of a central Fire and Waters be true, these Outlets seem to
be of greatest Use to the Peace and Quiet of the terraqueous Globe, in
venting the subterraneous Heat and Vapours; which, if pent up, would make
dreadful and dangerous Commotions of the Earth and Waters.

It may be then accounted as a special Favour of the divine Providence,
as is observed by the Author before praised[d], “That there are scarcely
any Countries, that are much annoyed with Earthquakes, that have not one
of these fiery Vents. And these, (saith he) are constantly all in Flames
whenever any Earthquake happens, they disgorging that Fire, which whilst
underneath, was the Cause of the Disaster. Indeed, (saith he,) were it
not for these _Diverticula_, whereby it thus gaineth an _Exit_, ’twould
rage in the Bowels of the Earth much more furiously, and make greater
Havock than now it doth. So, that though those Countries, where there are
such _Vulcano_’s, are usually more or less troubled with Earthquakes;
yet, were these _Vulcano_’s wanting, they would be much more annoyed with
them than now they are; yea, in all Probability to that Degree, as to
render the Earth, for a vast Space around them, perfectly uninhabitable.
In one word, (saith he) so beneficial are these to the Territories where
they are, that there do not want Instances of some which have been
rescued, and wholly delivered from Earthquakes by the breaking forth of
a new _Vulcano_ there; this continually discharging that Matter, which
being till then barricaded up, and imprisoned in the Bowels of the Earth,
was the occasion of very great and frequent Calamities”. Thus far that
ingenious Author.

CHAP. IV.

_Of the Mountains and Valleys._


The last Thing I shall take notice of relating to the Earth, shall be the
_Hills_ and _Valleys_. These the eloquent _Theorist_ owns to “contain
somewhat august and stately in the beholding of them, that inspireth
the Mind with great Thoughts and Passions, that we naturally on such
Occasions think of God and his Greatness”. But then, at the same Time
he saith, “The Hills are the greatest Examples of Ruin and Confusion;
that they have neither Form nor Beauty, nor Shape, nor Order, any more
than the Clouds in the Air; that they consist not of any proportion of
Parts, referable to any Design, nor have the least Footsteps of Art or
Counsel”. Consequently one grand Part of this lower Creation, even the
whole present Face of our terraqueous Globe, according to this ingenious
Author, is a Work of mere Chance, a Structure in which the Creator did
not concern himself.

Part of this Charge I have already briefly answered, and my Survey now
leads me to shew, that the Mountains are so far from being a Blunder of
Chance, a Work without Design, that they are a noble, useful, yea, a
necessary part of our Globe[a].

And in the first Place, as to the Business of Ornament, Beauty, and
Pleasure, I may appeal to all Men’s Senses, whether the grateful Variety
of Hills and Dales, be not more pleasing than the largest continued
Planes. Let those who make it their Business to visit the Globe, to
divert their Sight with the various Prospects of the Earth; let these, I
say, judge whether the far distant Parts of the Earth would be so well
worth visiting, if the Earth was every where of an even, level, globous
Surface, or one large Plane of many 1000 Miles; and not rather, as now it
is, whether it be not far more pleasing to the Eye, to view from the Tops
of the Mountains the subjacent Vales and Streams, and the far distant
Hills; and again from the Vales to behold the surrounding Mountains. The
elegant Strains and lofty Flights, both of the ancient and modern Poets
on these Occasions, are Testimonies of the Sense of Mankind on this
Configuration of the Earth.

But be the Case as it will as to Beauty, which is the least valuable
Consideration, we shall find as to Convenience, this Configuration of the
Earth far the most commodious on several Accounts.

1. As it is the most salubrious, of great use to the Preservation or
Restoration of the Health of Man. Some Constitutions are indeed of so
happy a Strength, and so confirmed in Health, as to be indifferent to
almost any Place or Temperature of the Air: But then others are so weakly
and feeble, as not to be able to bear one, but can live comfortably in
another Place. With some, the finer and more subtile Air of the Hills
doth best agree, who are languishing and dying in the feculent and
grosser Air of great Towns, or even the warmer, and vaporous Air of the
Valleys and Waters: But contrarywise, others languish on the Hills, and
grow lusty and strong in the warmer Air of the Valleys.

So that this Opportunity of shifting our Abode from the warmer and more
vaporous Air of the Valleys, to the colder and mote subtile Air of
the Hills, or from the Hills to the Vales, is an admirable Easement,
Refreshment, and great Benefit to the valetudinarian, feeble part
of Mankind, affording those an easy and comfortable Life, who would
otherwise live miserably, languish and pine away.

2. To this salutary Conformation of the Earth, we may add another great
Convenience of the Hills, and that is, in affording commodious Places for
Habitation; serving (as an eminent Author[b] wordeth it) “as Skreens to
keep off the cold and nipping Blasts of the northern and easterly Winds,
and reflecting the benign and cherishing Sun-Beams, and so rendering
our Habitations both more comfortable and more chearly in Winter; and
promoting the Growth of Herbs and Fruit-Trees, and the Maturation of the
Fruits in Summer.”

3. Another Benefit of the Hills is, that they serve for the Production
of great Varieties of Herbs and Trees[c]. And as there was not a better
Judge of those Matters, so I cannot give a better Account of this
Convenience, than in the Words of the last cited famous Author, the late
most eminent and learned Mr. _Ray_[d], (who hath so fully discussed this
Subject I am upon, that it is scarce possible to tread out of his Steps
therein). His Observation is, “That the Mountains do especially abound
with different Species of Vegetables, because of the great Diversity of
Soils that are found there, every _Vertex_ or Eminence almost, affording
new Kinds. Now these Plants, (saith he,) serve partly for the Food and
Sustenance of such Animals as are proper to the Mountains, partly for
medicinal Uses; the chief Physick, Herbs and Roots, and the best in their
Kinds growing there: It being remarkable, that the greatest and most
luxuriant Species in most Genera of Plants are native of the Mountains.”

4. Another Convenience which my last named learned Friend observes[e]
is, “That the Mountains serve for the Harbour, Entertainment, and
Maintenance of various Animals; Birds, Beasts and Insects, that breed,
feed and frequent there. For, (saith he) the highest Tops and Pikes of
the _Alps_ themselves are not destitute of their Inhabitants, the _Ibex_
or _Stein-buck_, the _Rupicapra_ or _Chamois_, among Quadrupeds; the
_Lagopus_ among Birds. And I my self (saith he) have observed beautiful
_Papilio_’s, and Store of other Insects upon the Tops of some of the
_Alpine_ Mountains. Nay, the highest Ridges of many of these Mountains,
serve for the Maintenance of Cattle, for the Service of the Inhabitants
of the Valleys.”

5. Another Thing he observes is, “That those long Ridges and Chains of
lofty and topping Mountains, which run through whole Continents East and
West[f], serve to stop the Evagation of the Vapours to the North and
South in hot Countries, condensing them like Alembick Heads into Water
and so (according to his Opinion) by a kind of external Distillation
giving original to Springs and Rivers; and likewise by amassing, cooling
and constipating of them, turn them into Rain, by those Means rendring
the fervid Regions of the torrid Zone habitable.”

To these might be added some other Uses and Conveniences[g]; as that the
Hills serve to the Generation of Minerals and Metals[h], and that in
them principally are the most useful Fossiles found; or if not found and
generated only in them, yet at least all these subterraneous Treasures
are most easily come at in them: Also their Use to several Nations of the
Earth, in being Boundaries and Bullwarks to them. But there is only one
Use more that I shall insist on, and that is,

6. And lastly, That it is to the Hills that the Fountains owe their Rise,
and the Rivers their Conveyance. As it is not proper, so neither shall
I here enter into any Dispute about the Origine of Springs, commonly
assigned by curious and learned Philosophers. But whether their Origine
be from condensed Vapours, as some think[i]; or from Rains falling, as
others; or whether they are derived from the Sea by way of Attraction,
Percolation, or Distillation; or whether all these Causes concur, or only
some, still the Hills are the grand Agent in this prodigious Benefit to
all the Earth: Those vast Masses and Ridges of Earth serving as so many
huge _Alembicks_ or _Cola_ in this noble Work of Nature.

But be the _Modus_, or the Method Nature takes in this great Work as it
will, it is sufficient to my Purpose, that the Hills are a grand Agent
in this so noble and necessary a Work: And consequently, that those vast
Masses and lofty Piles are not as they are charged, such rude and useless
Excrescences of our ill-formed Globe; but the admirable Tools of Nature,
contrived and ordered by the infinite Creator, to do one of its most
useful Works, and to dispense this great Blessing to all Parts of the
Earth; without which neither Animals could live, nor Vegetables scarcely
grow, nor perhaps Minerals, Metals, or Fossiles receive any Increase.
For was the Surface of the Earth even and level, and the middle Parts of
its Islands and Continents, not mountainous and high, (as now it is) it
is most certain there could be no Descent for the Rivers, no Conveyance
for the Waters; but instead of gliding along those gentle Declivities
which the higher Lands now afford them quite down to the Sea, they would
stagnate, and perhaps stink, and also drown large Tracts of Land.

But indeed, without Hills, as there could be no Rivers, so neither could
there be any Fountains, or Springs about the Earth; because, if we could
suppose a Land could be well watered (which I think not possible) without
the higher Lands, the Waters could find no Descent, no Passage through
any commodious Out-lets, by Virtue of their own Gravity; and therefore
could not break out into those commodious Passages and Currents, which
we every where almost find in, or near the Hills, and seldom, or never
in large and spacious Planes; and when we do find them in them, it is
generally at great and inconvenient Depths of the Earth; nay, those very
subterraneous Waters, that are any where met with by digging in these
Planes, are in all Probability owing to the Hills, either near or far
distant: As among other Instances may be made out, from the forcible
Eruption of the subterraneous Waters in digging Wells, in the _lower
Austria_, and the Territories of _Modena_, and _Bologna_ in _Italy_,
mentioned by my fore-named learned Friend Mr. _Ray_[k]. Or if there be
any such Place found throughout the Earth, that is devoid of Mountains,
and yet well watered, as perhaps some small Islands may; yet in this
very Case, that whole Mass of Land is no other than as one Mountain
descending, (though unperceivedly) gently down from the Mid-land Parts to
the Sea, as most other Lands do; as is manifest from the Descent of their
Rivers, the Principal of which in most Countries have generally their
Rise in the more lofty Mid-land Parts.

And now considering what hath been said concerning this last Use of the
Hills, there are two or three Acts of the divine Providence observable
therein. One is, that all Countries throughout the whole World, should
enjoy this great Benefit of Mountains, placed here and there, at due and
proper Distances, to afford these several Nations this excellent and most
necessary Element the Waters. For according to Nature’s Tendency, when
the Earth and Waters were separated, and order’d to their several Places,
the Earth must have been of an even Surface, or nearly so. The several
component Parts of the Earth, must have subsided according to their
several specifick Gravities, and at last have ended in a large, even,
spherical Surface, every where equi-distant from the Center of the Globe.
But that instead of this Form, so incommodious for the Conveyance of the
Waters, it should be jetted out every where into Hills and Dales, so
necessary for that purpose, is a manifest Sign of an especial Providence
of the wise Creator.

So another plain Sign of the same especial Providence of God, in this
Matter, is, that generally throughout the whole World, the Earth is
so dispos’d, so order’d, so well laid; I may say, that the Mid-land
Parts, or Parts farther from the Sea, are commonly the highest: Which
is manifest, I have said, from the Descent of the Rivers. Now this is
an admirable Provision the wise Creator hath made for the commodious
Passages of the Rivers, and for draining the several Countries, and
carrying off the superfluous Waters from the whole Earth, which would be
as great an Annoyance, as now they are a Convenience.

Another providential Benefit of the Hills supplying the Earth with Water,
is, that they are not only instrumental thereby, to the Fertility of
the Valleys, but to their own also[l]; to the Verdure of the Vegetables
without, and to the Increment and Vigour of the Treasures within them.

Thus having vindicated the present Form and Fabrick of the Earth, as
distributed into Mountains and Valleys, and thereby shewn in some Measure
the Use thereof, particularly of the Mountains, which are chiefly found
fault with: I have, I hope, made it in some Measure evident, that God was
no idle Spectator[m], nor unconcerned in the ordering of the terraqueous
Globe, as the former bold Charges against it do infer; that he did
not suffer so grand a Work, as the Earth, to go unfinish’d out of his
almighty Hand; or leave it to be ordered by Chance, by natural Gravity,
by casual Earthquakes, _&c._ but that the noble Strokes, and plain
Remains of Wisdom and Power therein, do manifest it to be his Work. That
particularly the Hills and Vales, though to a peevish weary Traveller,
they may seem incommodious and troublesome; yet are a noble Work of the
great Creator, and wisely appointed by him for the Good of our sublunary
World.

And so for all the other Parts of our terraqueous Globe, that are
presumed to be found fault with by some, as if carelessly order’d, and
made without any Design or End; particularly the Distribution of the dry
Land and Waters; the laying the several Strata, or Beds of Earth, Stone,
and other Layers before spoken of; the Creation of noxious Animals, and
poisonous Substances, the boisterous Winds; the Vulcano’s, and many other
Things which some are angry with, and will pretend to amend: I have
before shewn, that an infinitely wise Providence, an almighty Hand was
concerned even in them; that they all have their admirable Ends and Uses,
and are highly instrumental and beneficial to the Being, or Well-being of
this our Globe, or to the Creatures residing thereon.

So also for humane Bodies, it hath been an ancient[n], as well as modern
Complaint, that our Bodies are not as big as those of other Animals; that
we cannot run as swift as Deer, fly like Birds, and that we are out-done
by many Creatures in the Accuracy of the Senses, with more to the same
Purpose. But these Objections are well answered by _Seneca_[o], and will
receive a fuller Solution from what I shall observe of animal Bodies
hereafter.

But indeed, after all, it is only for want of our knowing these Things
better, that we do not admire[p] them enough; it is our own Ignorance,
Dulness or Prejudice, that makes us charge those noble Works of the
Almighty, as Defects or Blunders, as ill-contriv’d, or ill-made.

It is therefore fitter for such finite, weak, ignorant Beings as we, to
be humble and meek, and conscious of our Ignorance, and jealous of our
own Judgment, when it thus confronteth infinite Wisdom. Let us remember
how few Things we know, how many we err about, and how many we are
ignorant of: And those, many of them, the most familiar, obvious Things:
Things that we see and handle at Pleasure; yea, our own very Bodies,
and that very Part of us whereby we understand at all, our Soul. And
should we therefore pretend to censure what God doth! Should we pretend
to amend his Work! Or to advise infinite Wisdom! Or to know the Ends and
Purposes of his infinite Will, as if we were of his Council! No, let us
bear in Mind, that there Objections are the Products, not of Reason,
but of Peevishness. They have been incommoded by Storms and Tempests;
they have been terrify’d with the burning Mountains, and Earthquakes;
they have been annoy’d by the noxious Animals, and fatigu’d by the
Hills; and therefore are angry, and will pretend to amend these Works
of the Almighty. But in the Words of St. _Paul_[q], we may say, _Nay,
but O Man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the Thing
formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not
the Potter power over the Clay, of the same Lump to make one Vessel to
honour, and another to dishonour?_ If the Almighty Lord of the World,
had for his own Pleasure, made this our World more inconvenient for Man,
it would better become us to sit still, and be quiet; to lament our own
great Infirmities and Failings, which deserve a worse Place, a more
incommodious Habitation, than we meet with in this elegant, this well
contriv’d, well formed World; in which we find every Thing necessary for
the Sustentation, Use and Pleasure, both of Man, and every other Creature
here below; as well as some Whips, some Rods to scourge us for our
Sins[r]. But yet so admirably well temper’d is our State, such an Accord,
such an Harmony is there throughout the Creation, that if we will but
pursue the Ways of Piety and Virtue, which God hath appointed; if we will
form our Lives according to the Creator’s Laws, we may escape the Evils
of this our frail State, and find sufficient Means to make us happy while
we are in the Body. The natural Force and Tendency of our Virtue, will
prevent many of the Harms[s], and the watchful Providence of our Almighty
Benefactor, will be a Guard against others; and then nothing is wanting
to make us happy, as long as we are in this World, there being abundantly
enough to entertain the Minds of the most contemplative; Glories enough
to please the Eye of the most curious and inquisitive; Harmonies and
Conforts of Nature’s own, as well as Man’s making, sufficient to delight
the Ear of the most harmonious and musical; All Sorts of pleasant Gusto’s
to gratify the Taste and Appetite, even of the most luxurious; And
fragrant Odours to please the nicest and tenderest Smell: And in a Word,
enough to make us love and delight in this World, rather too much, than
too little, considering how nearly we are ally’d to another World, as
well as this.

[f] Many have taken Notice, that some of the greatest Eminences of the
World run generally East and West, of which take the late ingenious and
learned Dr. _Nichols_’s Account, [_Confer. with a Theist_, Part 2. pag.
191.] _To go no farther than our own Country, all our great Ridges of
Hills in ~England~ run East and West; so do the ~Alps~ in ~Italy~, and in
some Measure the ~Pyrenees~; so do the Mountains of the Moon in ~Africk~,
and so do Mount ~Taurus~ and ~Caucasus~._ This he saith _is a wise
Contrivance to prevent the Vapours, which would all run Northwards, and
leave no Rains in the ~Mediterranean~ Countries._

[g] That the Generation of many of the Clouds is owing to the Hills,
appears from the Observations of the ingenious and learned Dr. _Joh. Jam.
Scheuchzer_ of _Zurich_, and Mr. _Joach. Frid. Creitlovius_ cited by
him. They observed at Sun-rising, divers Clouds detached by the Heat of
the Sun, from some of the Tops of the _Alps_, &c. upon all which their
Observations, the Conclusion is, _Mirati summam Creatoris sapientiam,

[k] _Monsieur ~Blundel~, related to the ~Parisian~ Academy, what Device
the Inhabitants the lower ~Austria~, (which is encompassed with the
Mountains of ~Stiria~) are wont to use to fill their Wells with Water.
They dig in the Earth to the Depth of 25 and 20 Feet, till they come to
an Argilla ~[clammy Earth]~——which they bore through so deep, till the
Waters break forcibly out; which Water it is probable comes from the
neighbouring Mountains in subterraneous Chanels. And ~Cassinus~ observed,
that in many Places of the Territory of ~Modena~ and ~Bologna~ in
~Italy~, they make themselves Wells by the like Artifice, ~&c.~ By this
Means the same ~Seig. Cassini~ made a Fountain at the Castle of ~Urbin~,
that cast up the Water five Foot high above the level of the Ground._
_~Ray~’s_ Disc. 1. pag. 40. _ubi plura_.

Upon Enquiry of some skilful Workmen, whose Business it is to dig Wells,
_&c._ whether they had ever met with the like Case, as these in this
Note, they told me they had met with it in _Essex_, where after they had
dug to 50 Foot Depth, the Man in the Well observed the clayie Bottom to
swell and begin to send out Water, and stamping with his Foot to stop
the Water, he made way for so suddain and forcible a Flux of Water, that
before he could get into his Bucket, he was above his Waste in Water;
which soon ascended to 17 Feet height, and there stayed: And although
they often with great Labour endeavoured to empty the Well, in order to
finish their Work, yet they could never do it, but were forced to leave
it as it was.

[l] As the Hills being higher, are naturally disposed to be drier than
the Valleys; so kind Nature hath provided the greater Supplies of
Moisture for them, such at least of them as do not ascend above the
Clouds and Vapours. For, besides the Fountains continually watering them,
they have more Dews and Rains commonly than the Valleys. They are more
frequently covered with Fogs; and by retarding, stopping, or compressing
the Clouds, or by their greater Colds condensing them, they have larger
Quantities of Rain fall upon them. As I have found by actual Experience,
in comparing my Observations with those of my late very curious and
ingenious Correspondent, _Richard Townley_, Esq; of _Lancashire_, and
some others, to be met with before, _Chap. 2. Note (a)._ From which it
appears, that above double the Quantity of Rain falleth in _Lancashire_,
than doth at _Upminster_. The Reason of which is, because _Lancashire_
hath more, and much higher Hills than Essex hath. See _Book II. Chap. 5.

CHAP. I.

_Of the five Senses in general._


The first Thing to be consider’d, in common to all the Sensitive
Creatures, is, their Faculty of _Seeing_, _Hearing_, _Smelling_,
_Tasting_ and _Feeling_; and the _Organs_ ministring to there five
_Senses_, together with the exact Accommodation of those Senses, and
their Organs, to the State and Make of every Tribe of Animals[a].
The Consideration of which Particulars alone, were there no other
Demonstrations of God, is abundantly sufficient to evince the infinite
Wisdom, Power and Goodness, of the great Creator. For, Who can but stand
amaz’d at the Glories of these Works! At the admirable Artifice of them!
And at their noble Use and Performances! For suppose an Animal, as
such, had Breath and Life, and could move it self hither and thither;
yet how could it know whither to go, what it was about, where to find
its Food, how to avoid thousands of Dangers[b], without Sight! How
could Man, particularly, view the Glories of the Heavens, survey the
Beauties of the Fields, and enjoy the Pleasure of beholding the noble
Variety of diverting objects, that do, above us in the Heavens, and
here in this lower World, present themselves to our View every where;
how enjoy this, I say, without that admirable Sense of _Sight_[c]! How
could also the Animal, without _Smell_ and _Taste_, distinguish its Food,
and discern between wholsome and unwholsome; besides the Pleasures of
delightful Odours, and relishing Gusto’s! How, without that other Sense
of _Hearing_, could it discern many Dangers that are at a Distance,
understand the Mind of others, perceive the harmonious Sounds of Musick,
and be delighted with the Melodies of the winged Choir, and all the rest
of the Harmonies the Creator hath provided for the Delight and Pleasure
of his Creatures! And lastly, How could Man, or any other Creature
distinguish Pleasure from Pain, Health from Sickness, and consequently be
able to keep their Body sound and entire, without the Sense of _Feeling_!
Here, therefore, we have a glorious Oeconomy in every Animal, that
commandeth Admiration, and deserveth our Contemplation: As will better
appear by coming to Particulars, and distinctly considering the Provision
which the Creator hath made for each of these Senses.

_Of the Eye._


For our clearer Proceeding in the Consideration of this noble Part[a],
and understanding its Oeconomy, I shall consider:

1. The _Form_ of the Eye.

2. Its _Situation_ in the Body.

3. Its _Motions_.

4. Its _Size_.

5. Its _Number_.

6. Its _Parts_.

7. The _Guard_ and _Security_ Nature hath provided for this so useful a
Part.

As this eminent Part hath not been pretermitted by Authors, that have
made it their particular Design and Business to speak of the Works of
God; so divers of the aforesaid Particulars have been touched upon by
them. And therefore I shall take in as little as possible of what they
have said, and as near as I can, mention chiefly what they have omitted.
And,

1. For the _Form_ of the Eye; which is for the most part Globous, or
somewhat of the sphæroidal Form: Which is far the most commodious optical
Form, as being fittest to contain the Humours within, and to receive the
Images of Objects from without[b]. Was it a Cube, or of any multangular
Form, some of its Parts would lie too far off[c], and some too nigh
those lenticular Humours, which by their Refractions cause Vision.
But by Means of the Form before-mentioned, the Humours of the Eye are
commodiously laid together, to perform their Office of Refraction; and
the _Retina_, and every other Part of that little darkned Cell, is neatly
adapted regularly to receive the Images from without, and to convey them
accordingly to the common Sensory in the Brain.

To this we may add the aptitude of this Figure to the Motion of the Eye,
for it is necessary for the Eye to move this way, and that way, in order
to adjust it self to the Objects it would view; so by this Figure it is
well prepared for such Motions, so that it can with great Facility and
Dexterity direct it self as occasion requires.

And as the Figure, so no less commodious is,

2. The _Situation_ of the Eye, namely in the Head[d], the most erect,
eminent Part of the Body, near the most sensible, vital Part, the Brain.
By its Eminence in the Body, it is prepar’d to take in the more[e]
Objects. And by its Situation in the Head, besides its Proximity to the
Brain, it is in the most convenient Place for Defence and Security.
In the Hands, it might indeed (in Man) be render’d more eminent than
the Head, and be turned about here and there at pleasure. But then it
would be exposed to many Injuries in that active Part, and the Hands[f]
render’d a less active and useful Part. And the like may be said to its
Sight, in any other Part of the Body, but where it is. But in the Head,
both of Man, and other Animals, it is placed in a Part that seems to be
contrived, and made chiefly for the Action of the principal Senses.

Another Thing observable in the Sight of the Eye, is the Manner of its
Situation in the Head, in the Fore-part, or Side-part thereof; according
to the particular Occasions of particular Animals. In Man, and some other
Creatures, it is placed to look directly forward chiefly; but withal it
is so order’d, as to take in near the Hemisphere before it. In Birds, and
some other Creatures, the Eyes are so seated, as to take in near a whole
Sphere, that they may the better seek their Food, and escape Dangers. And
in some Creatures they are seated, so as to see best behind them[g], or
on each Side, whereby they are enabled to see their Enemy that pursues
them that way, and so make their Escape.

And for the Assistance of the Eyes, and some of the other Senses in their
Actions; the Head is generally made to turn here and there, and move as
Occasion requires. Which leads me to the

3. Thing to be remarked upon, the _Motions_ of the Eye it self. And this
is generally upwards, downwards, backwards, forwards, and every way[h],
for the better, more easy, and distinct Reception of the visual Rays.

But where Nature any way deviateth from this Method, either by denying
Motion to the Eyes, or the Head[i], it is a very wonderful Provision
she hath made in the Case. Thus for a Remedy of this Inconvenience, in
some Creatures their Eyes are set out at a Distance[k] from the Head,
to be circumvolved here and there, or one this, the other that way,
at Pleasure. And in Creatures, whose Eyes are without Motion, as in
divers Insects; in this Case, either they have more than two Eyes, or
their Eyes are nearly two protuberant Hemispheres, and each Hemisphere
often consisting of a prodigious number of other little Segments of a
Sphere[l]. By which Means those Creatures are so far from being deny’d
any Benefit, of that noble and most necessary Sense of Sight, that
they have probably more of it than other Creatures, answerable to the
Rapidity of their Flight, and brisk Motion; and to their Inquests after
Food, Habitation, or Repositories of Generation, or such other Necessity
of the Animal.

4. Another admirable Provision in the Eye, is, its Size; in some Animals
large, in some little. It would be endless here to enumerate Particulars;
as thole of Quadrupeds, Birds, Insects, and other terrestrial Animals.
And as for Fishes, they will fall under another Part of my Survey.

I shall therefore only take Notice of its Size in one Creature,
the _Mole_[m]. As the Habitation of that uncouth Animal is wholly
subterraneous, its Lodging, its Food, its Exercises, nay, even all its
Pastimes and Pleasures, are in those subterraneous Recesses and Passages,
which its own Industry hath made for it self; so it is an admirable
Provision made in the Size of the Eye of that little Creature, to answer
all its Occasions, and at the same time to prevent Inconveniences. For
as a little Light will suffice an Animal living always under Ground; so
the smallest Eye will abundantly supply that Occasion. And as a large
protuberant Eye, like that of other Animals, would much annoy this
Creature in its principal Business, of digging for its Food and Passage;
so it is endow’d with a very small one, commodiously seated in the Head,
and well fenced and guarded against the Annoyances of the Earth.

5. Another Thing remarkable in this noble Part of Animals, is, its
_Numbers_; no less than two[n] in any Instance, that I know of; and in
some Animals more, as I have already hinted[o].

Now this is an admirable Provision; first, for the Convenience of taking
in the larger Angle or Space: And in the next Place, the Animal is by
this Provision, in some Measure prepar’d for the Misfortune of the Loss
of one of these noble, and necessary Organs of its Body.

But then besides all this, there is another Thing considerable in this
multiplicate Number of the Eye; and that is, that the Object seen is
not multiplied as well as the Organ, and appears but one, though seen
with two or more Eyes[p]. A manifest Sign of the infinite Skill of the
Contriver of this so noble a Part, and of the exquisite Art he employed
in the Formation thereof. But the Design and Skill of the infinite
Workman, will best be set forth by

6. Surveying the _Parts_ and _Mechanism_ of this admirable Organ the Eye.
And here indeed we cannot but stand amazed, when we view its admirable
Fabrick, and consider the prodigious Exactness, and the exquisite Skill
employed in every part ministring to this noble and necessary Sense.
To pass by its Arteries and Veins, and such other Parts common to the
rest of the Body, let us cast our Eye on its _Muscles_. These we shall
find exactly and neatly placed for every Motion of the Eye. Let us view
its _Tunicks_, and these we shall find so admirably seated, so well
adapted, and of so firm a Texture, as to fit every Place, to answer
every Occasion, and to be Proof against all common Inconveniences and
Annoyances. Let us examine its three _Humours_, and these we shall find
all of exquisite Clearness and Transparency, for an easy Admission of the
Rays; well placed for the refracting of them, and formed (particularly
the _Crystalline Humour_) by the nicest Laws of Opticks, to collect the
wandring Rays into a Point. And to name no more, let us look into its
darkned Cell, where those curious Humours lie, and into which the Glories
of the Heavens and the Earth are brought, and exquisitely pictured; and
this Cell we shall find, without, well prepared by Means of its Texture,
Aperture, and Colour, to fence off all the useless or noxious Rays; and
within, as well coated with a dark Tegument, that it may not reflect,
dissipate, or any way confuse or disturb the beneficial Rays[q].

But to descend to Particulars, although it would be a great Demonstration
of the Glory of God, yet would take up too much Time, and hath been in
some Measure done by others that have written of God’s Works. Passing
over therefore what they have observed, I shall under each principal Part
take a transient Notice of some Things they have omitted, or but slightly
spoken of.

And my first Remark shall be concerning the _Muscles_ of the Eye, and
their Equilibration. Nothing can be more manifestly an act of Contrivance
and Design, than the _Muscles_ of the Eye, admirably adapted to move
it any, and every way; upwards, downwards, to this side or that, or
howsoever we please, or there is occasion for, so as to always keep
that Parallelism of the Eye, which is necessary to true Vision. For
the Performance of which Service, the Form, the Position, and the
due Strength of each Muscle is admirable. And here I might Instance
the peculiar and artificial Structure of the _Trochlearis_, and the
Augmentation of its Power by the _Trochlea_[r]; the Magnitude and
Strength of the _Attollent Muscle_, somewhat exceeding that of its
Antagonist; the peculiar Muscle, called the _Seventh_, or _Suspensory
Muscle_[s], given to Brutes, by reason of the prone Posture of their
Bodies, and frequent Occasions to hang down their Heads: And I might
speak also of the peculiar Origine and Insertion of the _lower Oblique
Muscle_[t], which is very notable, and many other Things relating to
these Parts; but it would be tedious to descend too much to those
admirable Particulars. And therefore to close up these Remarks, all I
shall farther take Notice of, shall be only the exquisite Equilibration
of all these _Opposite_ and _Antagonist Muscles_, affected partly by
the Equality of the Strength; which is the Case of the _Adducent_ and
_Abducent Muscles_; partly by their peculiar Origine, or the Addition of
the _Trochlea_, which is the Case of the _Oblique Muscles_[u]: and partly
by the natural Posture of the Body, and the Eye, which is the Case of
the _Attollent_ and _Depriment Muscles_. By this so curious and exact
a Libration, not only unseemly Contortions, and incommodious Vagations
of the Eye are prevented, but also it is able with great Readiness and
Exactness to apply it self to every Object.

As to the _Tunicks_ of the Eye, many Things might be taken notice of,
the prodigious Fineness of the _Arachnoïdes_, the acute Sense of the
_Retina_, the delicate Transparency of the _Cornea_[w], and the firm and
strong Texture of that and the _Sclerotica_ too; and each of them, in
these and every other respect, in the most accurate manner adapted to
the Place in which it is, and the Business it is there to perform. But
for a Sample, I shall only take notice of that part of the _Uvea_ which
makes the _Pupil_. It hath been observed by others, particularly by our
Honourable Founder[x], That as we are forced to use various Apertures to
our Optick Glasses, so Nature hath made a far more compleat Provision in
the Eyes of Animals, to shut out too much, and to admit sufficient Light,
by the Dilatation and Contraction of the Pupil[y]. But it deserveth our
especial Remark, that these Pupils are in divers Animals of divers Forms,
according to their peculiar Occasions. In some (particularly in Man) it
is round; that being the most proper Figure for the Position of our Eyes,
and the Use we make of them both by Day and Night. In some other Animals
it is of a longish Form; in some Transverse[z], with its Aperture large,
which is an admirable Provision for such Creatures to see the better
laterally, and thereby avoid Inconveniencies, as well as help them to
gather their Food on the Ground, both by Day and Night. In other Animals
the Fissure of the Pupil is erect[aa], and also capable of opening
wide, and shutting up close. The latter of which serveth to exclude the
brighter Light of the Day, and the former to take in the more faint Rays
of the Night, thereby enabling those Nocturnal Animals (in whom generally
this erect Form of the Pupil is) to catch their Prey with the greater
Facility in the dark[bb], to see upwards and downwards, to climb, _&c_.
Thus much for the _Tunicks_.

The next Thing I shall take notice of, will relate to the _Humours_ of
the Eye, and that only concerning the Mechanism of the _Crystalline
Humour_; not its incomparable Transparency; nor its exact lenticular
Form; nor its curious araneous Membrane[cc], that constringeth and
dilateth it, and so varieth its _Focus_, (if any such Variation there
be, as some affirm with great Probability,) nor lastly, its admirable
Approach to or from the _Retina_, by help of the _Ciliar Ligament_[dd],
according as Objects are far off or near, because these Things are what
are usually taken notice of; but that which I shall observe is, the
prodigious Art and Finery of its constituent Parts, it being, according
to some late nice Microscopical Observations[ee], composed of divers
thin Scales, and these made up of one single minutest Thread or Fibre,
wound round and round, so as not to cross one another in any one Place,
and yet to meet, some in two, and some in more different Centers; a Web
not to be woven, an _Optick Lens_, not to be wrought by any Art less than
infinite Wisdom.

_Lastly_, To conclude the Parts of this admirable Organ, I shall make
only one Remark more, and that is about its _Nerves_. And here, among
others, the admirable Make of the _Optick Nerves_ might deserve to
be taken notice of in the first Place, their _Medullary_ Part[ff]
terminating in the Brain it self, the Teguments propagated from the
_Meninges_, and terminating in the Coats of the Eye, and their commodious
Insertions into the Ball of the Eye, in some directly opposite to the
Pupil of the Eye, in others obliquely towards one Side[gg]. But most of
these Things have been treated of, and the Convenience hereof set forth
by others that have written of God’s Works. I shall therefore take notice
only of one wise Provision the Creator hath made about the Motion of the
Eye, by uniting into one the _Third Pair_ of Nerves, called the _Motory
Nerves_[hh], each of which sending its Branches into each Muscle of each
Eye, would cause a Distortion in the Eyes; but being united into one,
near their Insertion into the Brain, do thereby cause both Eyes to have
the same Motion; so that when one Eye is moved this way and that way, to
this and that Object, the other Eye is turned the same way also.

Thus from this transient and slight View (I may call it) of the Parts of
the Eye, it appears what an admirable Artist was the Contriver thereof.
And now in the

_Seventh_ and last Place, Let us consider what Provision this admirable
Artist hath made for the _Guard_ and _Security_ of this so well formed
Organ[ii]. And here we shall find the Guard equivalent to the Use and
Excellency of the Part. The whole Organ fortified and fenced with strong,
compact Bones, lodged in a strong, well made Socket, and the Eye it self
guarded with a nice made Cover[kk]. Its Humours, and its inward Tunicks,
are indeed tender, proportionate to their tender, curious Uses; but the
Coats without, are context and callous, firm and strong. And in some
Animals, particularly Birds[ll], some Part of those Tunicles have the
Nature and Hardness of Bone or Horn.

But for Creatures, whose Eyes, like the rest of their Body, are tender,
and without the Guard of Bones; there Nature hath provided for this
necessary and tender Sense, a wonderful kind of Guard, by endowing the
Creature with a Faculty of withdrawing its Eyes into its Head[mm], and
lodging them in the same Safety with the Body.

Thus have I survey’d this first Sense of Animals, I may say in a cursory,
not accurate, strict manner, considering the prodigious Workmanship
thereof; but so, as abundantly to demonstrate it to be the Contrivance,
the Work of no less a Being than the infinite Wise, Potent, and Indulgent
Creator[nn]. For none less could compose so admirable an Organ, so adapt
all its Parts, so adjust it to all Occasions, so nicely provide for every
Use, and for every Emergency: In a word, none less than GOD, could, I
say, thus contrive, order, and provide an Organ, as magnificent and
curious as the Sense is useful; a Sense without which, as all the Animal
World would be in perpetual Darkness, so it would labour under perpetual
Inconveniencies, be exposed to perpetual Harms, and suffer perpetual
Wants and Distresses. But now by this admirable Sense, the great GOD, who
hath placed us in this World, hath as well provided for our comfortable
Residence in it; enabled us to see and chuse wholsome, yea delicate Food,
to provide our selves useful, yea gaudy Cloathing, and commodious Places
of Habitation and Retreat. We can now dispatch our Affairs with Alacrity
and Pleasure, go here and there as our Occasions call us. We can, if need
be, ransack the whole Globe, penetrate into the Bowels of the Earth,
descend to the bottom of the Deep, travel to the farthest Regions of this
World, to acquire Wealth, to encrease our Knowledge, or even only to
please our Eye and Fancy. We can now look about us, discern and shun the
Precipices and Dangers which every where enclose us, and would destroy
us. And those glorious Objects which fill the Heavens and the Earth,
those admirable Works of God which every where surround us, and which
would be as nothing to us, without being seen, do by means of this noble
Sense present their Glories to us[oo], and fill us with Admiration and
Pleasure. But I need not expatiate in the Usefulness and Praises of this
Sense, which we receive the Benefit of every Moment, and the want, or any
defect of which, we lament among our greatest Misfortunes.

Leaving then this Sense, I shall proceed to the other four, but more
briefly treat of them, by reason we have so ample a Sample of the divine
Art in the last, and may presume that the same is exerted in all as well
as one. For a Demonstration of which, let us in the next Place carry our
Scrutiny to the Sense of _Hearing_.

So likewise that accurate Surveyor of the Eye, Dr. _Briggs_, whose
_Ophthalmography_ I have met with since my penning this part of my
Survey. His Character of this curious piece of God’s Work is, _Inter
præcipuas corporis animati partes, quæ magni Conditoris nostri sapientiam
ostendunt, nulla sanè reperitur, quæ majori pompâ elucet quàm ipse
Oculus, aut quæ elegantiori formâ concinnatur. Deum enim aliæ partes vel
minori satellitio stipantur, vel in tantam venustatem haud assurgunt;
Ocelli peculiarem honorem & decus à supremo Numine efflatum referunt, &
nunquam non stupendæ suæ Potentia characteres repræsentant. Nulla sanè
pars tam divino artificio & ordine, ~&c.~_ Cap. 1. §. 1.

[b] It is a good Reason _Frier Bacon_ assigns for the Sphæricity of the
Eye: _Nam si esset planæ figuræ, species rei majoris oculo non posset
cadere perpendiculariter super eum——Cùm ergò Oculus videt magna corpora,
ut ferè quartam cœli uno aspectu, manifestum est, quòd non potest esse
planæ figuræ, nec alicujus nisi sphæricæ, quoniam super sphæram parvam
possunt cadere perpendiculares infinitæ, quæ à magno corpore veniunt, &
tendunt in centrum Sphæræ: Et sic magnum corpus potest ab oculo parvo
videri._ For the Demonstration of which he hath given us a Figure. _Rog.
Bacon. Perspect. Distinct. 4. Cap. 4._

Dr. _Briggs_ saith, _Pars antica, (sive Cornea,) convexior est posticâ:
hâc enim ratione radii meliùs in pupillam detorquentur, & Oculi fundus
ex altarâ parte in majorem (propter imagines rerum ibidem delineandos)
expanditur._ Ibid. §. 2.

[c] Suppose the Eye had the _Retina_, or back part flat for the Reception
of the Images, as in _Fig. 1._ ABA: it is manifest, that if the Extremes
of the Image AA were at a due focal distance, the middle B would be too
nigh the Crystalline, and consequently appear confused and dim; but all
Parts of the _Retina_ lying at a due focal distance from the Crystalline,
as at ACA, therefore the Image painted thereon is seen distinct and
clear. Thus in a dark Room, with a Lens at a Hole in the Window, (which
_Sturmius_ calls his Artificial Eye, in his _Exercit. Acad._ one of which
he had made for his Pupils, to run any where on Wheels). In this Room, I
say, if the Paper that receives the Images be too nigh, or too far off
the Lens, the Image will be confused and dim; but in the Focus of the
Glass, distinct, clear, and a pleasant Sight.

[f] _Galen_ deserves to be here consulted, who in his Book _De Usu
Partium_, from many Considerations of the Hand, such as what is here
mentioned, as also its Structure, Site and Use, largely proves and
reflects upon the Wisdom and Providence of the Contriver and Maker of
that Part.

[g] Thus in _Hares_ and _Conies_, their Eyes are very protuberant, and
placed so much towards the sides of their Head, that their two Eyes take
in nearly a whole Sphere: Whereas in _Dogs_, (that pursue them) the Eyes
are set more forward in the Head, to look that way more than backward.

siquid noceret; & aspectum, quo vellent, facile converterent_. Cicer. de
Nat. Deor. l. 2. c. 57.

[i] _The Eyes of ~Spiders~, ~(in some four, in some six, and in some
eight)~ are placed all in the fore-front of their Head, (which is round,
and without any Neck) all diaphanous and transparent, like a Locket of
Diamonds, ~&c.~ neither wonder why Providence should be so anomalous
in this Animal, more than in any other we know of. For, 1. Since they
wanting a Neck, cannot move their Head, it is requisite that Defect
should be supplied by the multiplicity of Eyes. 2. Since they were to
live by catching so nimble a Prey as a Fly is, they ought to see her
every way, and to take her ~per saltum~, (as they do) without any Motion
of the Head to discover her: Which Motion would have scared away so
timorous an Insect._ _~Power~’s_ Micros. Observ. pag. 11.

_The Eyes of the ~Cameleon~ resemble a Lens, or Convex Glass, set in
a versatile globular Socket, which she turneth backward, or any way,
without moving her Head; and ordinarily the one a contrary, or quite
different way from the other._ Dr. _Goddard_ in Phil. Tran. Nᵒ. 137.

_But what is more extraordinary in this Motion ~[of the Cameleon’s Eye]~
is to see one of the Eyes move, whilst the other remains immoveable; and
the one to turn forward, at the same time that the other looketh behind;
the one to look up to the Sky, when the other is fixed on the Ground.
And these Motions to be so extreme, that they do carry the ~Pupilla~
under the Crest which makes the Eye-brow, and so far into the ~Canthi~,
or Corners of the Eyes, that the Sight can discern whatever is done
just behind it, and directly before, without turning the Head, which is
fastned to the Shoulders._ Mem. for a Nat. Hist. in Anatom. Dissect. at
Paris. Diss. of Camel. pag. 22.

[k] _Snails_ send out their Eyes at a distance, they being contained in
their four Horns, _like atramentous Spots, fitted to the end of their
Horns, or rather to the ends of those black Filaments or optick Nerves,
which are sheathed in her Horns_, as Dr. _Power_ wordeth it. _Obs. 31.
pag. 36._ So the ingenious Dr. _Lister_. _Exercit. Anat. Cochl. & Limac._

[l] _Vid._ _l. 8. c. 3. Note (a)._

[m] _Severinus_ is of _Aristotle_’s, _Pliny_’s, and _Alb. Magnus_’s
Opinion, that the _Mole_ hath no Sight; _G. Seger_ denies any Humour to
be therein, but thinks they may probably see, because Nature made nothing
in vain. But _Borrichius_ saith, their Eyes have _appendiculam nerveam in
cerebrum euntem, cujus beneficio globuli illi ~[the little Eyes]~ extra
pellem facilè poterant exseri, retrahique pro arbitrio——In illis oculorum
globulis humor aqueus copiose satis natabat; cæterorum non nisi tenue
vestigiem._ Blas. Anat. Anim. c. 35.

_Et quoniam Natura hoc vitæ genus ipsi destinavit, etiam perquàm exiguos
Oculos——dedit eo concilio, ut ii, pretiosissima corporis pars, à terræ
pulvere nè affligerentur. Ii insuper pilis recti, ~&c.~ Humores illis
oculis insunt, & tunica nigra, uvea, se prodit. Ad hos tramite alio
nervus venit._ Schneider in Blas. ibid.

Some time since I made divers accurate Dissections of the _Eyes_ of
_Moles_, with the help of Microscopes, having a doubt whether what we
take to be Eyes, were such or no. And upon a strict Scrutiny I plainly
could distinguish the _Vitreous_ and _Crystalline_ Humours, yea, the
_Ligamentum Ciliare_, and the atramentaceous _Mucus_. The _Pupil_ I could
manifestly discern to be round, and the _Cornea_ copped, or conical: The
Eye is at a great distance from the Brain, the Optick Nerve very slender
and long, reaching from the Eye through the intermediate Flesh, and so
passeth to the Brain, along with the pair of Nerves reaching to the Nose,
which are much the largest that are in all the Animal. These Creatures,
I imagine, have the Faculty of withdrawing their Eyes, if not quite into
the Head, (as _Snails_) yet more or less within the Hair, as they have
more or less Occasion to use or guard their Eyes.

_Galen_ saith, _Moles_ have Eyes, the _Crystalline_ and _Vitreous_
Humours, encompassed with _Tunicks_. _De Us. Part. l. 14. c. 6._ So
accurate an Anatomist was he for his Time.

[n] _Pliny_ tells us of a sort of _Heron_ with but one Eye, but ’twas
only by hear-say. _Inter Aves Ardeolarum genere, quos Leucos vocant,
altero oculo carere tradunt._ Nat. Hist. l. 11. c. 37. So the King of the
_Nigræ_ that hath but one Eye, and that in his Forehead, _l. 6. c. 30._
Which Fables I take notice of more for the Reader’s Diversion, than any
Truth in them.

[o] _Supra_, _Note (i)._

[p] The most celebrated Anatomists differ greatly about the Reason why
we see not double with two Eyes. This _Galen_, and others after him,
generally thought to be from a Coalition or Decussation of the Optick
Nerves, behind the _Os Sphenoïdes_. But whether they decussate, coalesce,
or only touch one another, they do not well agree. The _Bartholines_
expressly assert they are united, _non per simplicem contactum vel
intersectionem in homine, sed totalem substantiæ confusionem_, Anat.
l. 3. c. 2. And whereas _Vesalius_, and some others had found some
Instances of their being disunited; they say, _sed in plerisque ordinarie
confunditur interior substantia, ut accuratâ disquisitione deprehendi_.

But our Learned Dr. _Gibson_, (_Anat. l. 3. c. 10._) saith, they _are
united by the closest Conjunction, but not Confusion of their Fibres_.

But others think the Reason is not from any Coalescence, Contact, or
crossing of the Optick Nerves, but from a Sympathy between them. Thus
Monsieur _Cartes_ is of Opinion, that the _Fibrillæ_ constituting the
medullary Part of those Nerves, being spread in the _Retina_ of each Eye,
have each of them corresponding Parts in the Brain; so that when any of
those _Fibrillæ_ are struck by any part of an Image, the corresponding
Parts of the Brain are thereby affected, and the Soul thereby informed,
_&c._ but see more hereafter under _Note (oo)_, from _Cartes_ himself.

Somewhat like this is the Notion of our judicious Dr. _Briggs_, who
thinks the Optick Nerves of each Eye consist of _Homologous Fibres_,
having their rise in the _Thalamus Nervorum Opticorum_, and thence
continued to both the _Retinæ_, which are made of them; And farther, that
those _Fibrillæ_ have the same Parallelism, Tension, _&c._ in both Eyes;
and consequently when an Image is painted on the same corresponding,
sympathizing Parts of each _Retina_, the same Effects are produced, the
same Notice or Information is carried to the _Thalamus_, and so imparted
to the Soul, or judging Faculty. That there is such an Ὁμοιοπάθεια
between the _Retina_, &c. he makes very probable from the ensuing of
double Vision upon the Interruption of the Parallelism of the Eyes; as
when one Eye is depressed with the Finger, or their Symphony interrupted
by Disease, Drunkenness, _&c._ And lastly, That simple Vision is not
made in the former way, _viz._ by a Decussation or Conjunction of the
Optick Nerves, he proves, because those Nerves are but in few Subjects
decussated, and in none conjoined otherwise than by a bare Contact, which
is particularly manifest in Fishes; and in some Instances it hath been
found, that they have been separated without any double Vision ensuing
thereupon. _Vid._ _Brig. Ophthalmogr._ cap. 11. & 5. and _Nov. Vis.
Theor._ _passim_.

What the Opinion of our justly eminent Sir _Isaac Newton_ is, may be
seen in his _Opticks_, Qu. 15. _Are not the Species of Objects seen with
both Eyes, united where the Optick Nerves meet before they come into the
Brain, the Fibres on the right side of both Nerves uniting there, ~&c.~
For the Optick Nerves of such Animals as look the same way with both
Eyes, (as of Men, Dogs, Sheep, Oxen, ~&c.~) meet before they come into
the Brain; but the Optick Nerves of such Animals as do not look the same
way with both Eyes, (as of Fishes and of the Cameleon) do not meet, if I
am rightly informed._ Newt. Opt. Q. 15.

Willis de An. Brut. p. 1. c. 15.

Of this Opinion also was _Bartholine Anat._ l. 3. c. 8. and divers other
eminent Anatomists.

But Dr. _Briggs_ is of Opinion that the _Adnata_, and the other Muscles
sufficiently answer all those Ends ascribed to that Muscle by former
Anatomists, and thinks _Probabiliùs itaque esse hunc Musculum nervi
Optici actionem (per vices) confirmare, nè à prono Brutorum incessu &
copioso affluxu humorum debilitetur_, Ophthal. c. 2. §. 2.

The _Musculus Suspensorius_ being in the _Porpess_, as well as Brutes,
Dr. _Tyson_ thinks the Use of it is not to suspend the Bulk of the
Eye; but rather by its equal Contraction of the _Sclerotis_, to render
the Ball of the Eye more or less Spherical, and so fitter for Vision.
_Tyson’s Anat. of the Porpess_, p. 39.

[t] _Musculus obliquus inferior oritur à peculiari quodam foramine in

internum externumve canthum; quæ quidem Libratio omnino nulla fuisset,

Anatomicos latuit)._ And so this curious Anatomist goes on to shew
farther the stupendous Artifice of the great Creator in this Position of
the _Oblique Muscles_. Brigg’s _Nova Vis. Theor._ p. 11. _meo libro_.

[u] Besides those particular Motions which the Eye receives from the
_Oblique Muscles_, and I may add its Libration also in some Measure, some
Anatomists ascribe another no less considerable Use to them; namely, to
lengthen and shorten the Eye (by squeezing and compressing it) to make it
correspond to the Distances of all Objects, according as they are nigh
or far off. Thus the ingenious Dr. _Keil_; _The Aqueous Humour being the
thinnest and most liquid, easily changeth its Figure, when either the
~Ligamentum Ciliate~ contracts, or both the ~Oblique Muscles~ squeeze the
middle of the Ball of the Eye, to render it Oblong when Objects are too
near us._ _~Keil~’s Anat. Chap. 4. Sect. 4._ See _Note (y)._

[x] _Boyl_ of _Final Causes._

[y] It is easy to be observed, that the _Pupil_ openeth in dark Places;
as also when we look at far distant Objects, but contracts by an Increase
of Light, and when the Objects are nigh. This Motion of the _Pupil_
some say, is effected by the circular and strait Fibres of the _Uvea_,
and some attribute it to the _Ligamentum Ciliare_. Yet I have no great
doubt but that they both concur in that Action, and that the _Ligamentum
Ciliare_ doth, at the same time the Pupil opens or shuts, dilate or
compress the _Crystalline_, and bring it nigher unto, or carry it farther
off the _Retina_. For the Structure of the _Ligamentum Ciliare_, and its
two Sorts of Fibres, drawn with the Help of a Microscope, I shall refer
to Mr. _Cowper’s Anat._ T. 11.

[z] _In Bove, Caprâ, Equo, Ove, & quibusdam aliis elliptica est
~(Pupilla)~ ut eo magis in hisce forsan animalibus, quæ prono incessu

[aa] Thus _Cats_ (their Pupils being erect, and the shutting of their
Eye-lids transverse thereunto) can so close their Pupil, as to admit of,
as it were, one only single Ray of Light; and by throwing all open, they
can take in all the faintest Rays. Which is an incomparable Provision for
these Animals, that have occasion to watch and way-lay their Prey both by
Day and Night.

[bb] There is besides this large opening of the Pupil, in some nocturnal
Animals, another admirable Provision, enabling them to catch their Prey
in the Dark; and that is a Radiation of the Eyes: Of which Dr. _Willis_
thus; _Hujus usus est Oculi Pupillam, quasi jubare insito, illuminare,
ut res noctu, & in tenebris positas conspicere valeat: quare in Fele
plurimùm illustris est: at Homini, Avibus, & Piscibus deest._ This
Illumination he speaks of, is from the _Tapetum_, in the Bottom of the
Eye, or the shining of the _Retina_, round the optick Nerve.

Besides which, he saith, the _Iris_ hath a Faculty also, in some, of
darting out Rays of Light, so as to enable them to see in the Dark: Of
which he tells this Story; _Novi quendam cerebro calidiori præditum,
qui post uberiorem vini generosi potum in nocte atratâ, sive tenebris
profundis, literas distincte legere potuit. Cujus ratio videtur esse,
quòd spiritus animales velut accensi, adeòque ab hâc Iride irradiantes,
jubare infito Medium illuminabant._ Willis Ibid.

Such another Thing, _Pliny_ tells us, was reported of _Tiberius Cæsar_:
_Ferunt Tib. Cæs. nec alii genitorum mortalium, fuisse naturam,
ut expergefactus noctu paulisper, haud alio modo quam luce clarâ,
contueretur omnia._ Nat. Hist. l. 11. c. 37.

So Dr. _Briggs_: _Virum sanè calidæ indolis novi in Comitatu Bedfordiensi
degentem, qui oculis felineis——donatus est: adeò ut epistolam——mirè
admodùm in loco obscuro (ubi eadem mihi vix apparuit) perlegit. Hujus
verò Oculi (nisi quod Pupillas insigniores obsinuere) ab aliorum
formatione neutiquam discrepabant._ Ophthal. c. 5. §. 12.

[cc] The _Tunica Aranea_ is taken notice of by _Frier Bacon_, who
calls it, _Tela Aranea_, and saith, _in hâc continetur——glaciale vel
Crystallinum_. _~Rog. Bacon~’s Perspect. Distinct. 2. c. 3._ The
wrinkling of this, and the _Cornea_ (as the Skin is of old Persons)
he thinks is the Cause of the Obscurity of the Sight in such Persons.
_Bacon_ Ib. par. 2. cap. 2. But this _Tunick_ some deny, and others
allow of: Dr. _A. M._ of _Trinity-College, Dublin_, (in his _Relat. of
Anat. Obs._ in the Eyes of Animals, in a Letter to Mr. _Boyl_, _Ann.
1682._ annexed to his _Anat. Account of the Elephant burnt in ~Dublin~_,
p. 57.) affirms the _Tunica Aranea_, and saith, _I have often seen it
before ’twas exposed to the Air one Minute, notwithstanding what Dr.
~Briggs~ saith to the contrary, ~&c.~_ But Dr. _Briggs_ his Opinion is,
_Humor Crystallinus, nisi aeri diutiùs expositus, vel lenitèr coctus
(instar lactis) cuticulam non acquirit: quæ verò impropriè, Tunica Aranea
dicitur, cùm si tantùm adventitia, ut in Oculo Bovis recens execto
appareat._ _~Briggs~’s Ophthalm. c. 3._

The _Crystalline Humour_ being of a double Substance, outwardly like
a Gelly, towards the Center as consistent as hard Suet, upon occasion
whereof its Figure may be varied; which Variation may be made by the
_Ligamentum Ciliare_; Dr. _Grew_ doth, upon these Accounts, not doubt to
ascribe to the _Ligamentum Ciliare_, a Power of making the _Crystalline_
more Convex, as well as of moving it to, or from the _Retina_. See
_Grew_’s _Cosmolog. Sacr._ l. 1. c. 4. Now it is certain by the Laws
of Opticks, that somewhat of this is absolutely necessary to distinct
Vision, inasmuch as the Rays proceeding from nigh Objects do more
diverge, and those from distant Objects less: Which requires either that
the _Crystalline Humour_ should be made more Convex, or more flat; or
else an Elongation, or shortning of the Eye, or of the Distance between
the _Crystalline Humour_ and the _Retina_.

But although Dr. _Briggs_ (so good a Judge) denies the _Tunica
Crystallina_, contrary to the Opinion of most former Anatomists; yet
there is great Reason to conclude he was in a Mistake, in my Opinion,
from the Observations of the _French Anatomists_, of the _Crystalline_ of
the Eye, of the _Gemp_ or _Chamois_, who say, _The Membrana Arachnoïdes
was very thick, and hard, so that it was easily separated from the
Crystallinus_, p. 145.

The same Anatomists also favour the Surmise of Dr. _Grew_, This
[Contraction of the Fibres of the _Ligamentum Ciliare_ on one side,
and Dilatation on the other] _would make us think that these Fibres of
the ~Ligamentum Ciliare~, are capable of Contraction, and voluntary
Dilatation, like that of the Fibres of the Muscles; and that this Action
may augment, or diminish the Convexity of the ~Crystallinus~, according
as the Need which the Distance of the Objects may make it to have on the
Eye, to see more clearly and distinctly._ Anat. Descrip. of a _Bear_, p.
49.

Since my penning the foregoing Notes, having as critically as I could,
dissected many Eyes of Birds, Beasts and Fishes, I manifestly found the
_Membrana Arachnoïdes_, and will undertake to shew it any one, with
great Ease and Certainty. It is indeed so transparent, as not to be seen
distinct from the _Crystalline_. But if the _Cornea_ and _Uvea_ be taken
off before, or the _vitreous Humour_ behind it, and the out-side of the
_Crystalline_ be gently cut, the _Arachnoïdes_ may be seen to open, and
the _Crystalline_ will easily leap out, and part from the _Ligamentum
Ciliare_; which otherwise it would not do: For it is by the _Arachnoïdes_
braced to the _Ligamentum Ciliare_. This Membrane or Tunick, in the Ox,
is so substantial and strong, though thin, that it yields to, or sinks
under the sharpest Lancet, and requires (for so thin and weak a Membrane
in appearance) a strong Pressure to pierce it.

[dd] As Birds and Fishes are in divers Things conformable, so in some
sort they are in their Eye; to enable it to correspond to all the
Convergences, and Divergences of the Rays, which the Variations of each
of the Mediums may produce. For this Service the _Tunica Choroeides_,
(in Fishes) hath a musculous Substance at the Bottom of it, lying round
the optick Nerve, at a small Distance from it; by which Means I imagine
they are able to contract, and dilate the _Choroeides_, and thereby to
lengthen and shorten the Eye: For the helping in which Service, I imagine
it is that the _Choroeides_, and _Sclerotica_, are in a great Measure
parted, that the _Choroeides_ may have the greater Liberty of acting upon
the Humours within.

But in Birds, I have my self found, that although the _Choroeides_ be
parted from the _Sclerotica_; yet the _Choroeides_ hath no Muscle,
but instead thereof, a curious pectinated Work, seated on the optick
Nerve, represented in _Fig. 2._ In which _c.a.e.b.d._ represents the
_Choroeides_ and _Sclerotica_: _a.b._ the Part of the _optick Nerve_,
that is within the Eye: _v.v.v._ the _vitreous Humour_: _a.f.g.b._ the
_Pecten_: _h.i._ the _Crystalline_. For the Reception of this _Pecten_,
the _optick Nerve_ comes farther within the Eye, than in other Creatures.
The Structure of this _Pecten_, is very like that of the _Ligamentum
Ciliare_; and in the Eye of a _Magpy_, and some others, I could perceive
it to be musculous towards the Bottom. This _Pecten_ is so firmly fixed
unto, or embodied in the _vitreous Humour_, that the _vitreous Humour_
hangs firmly to it, and is not so easily parted from it. By which
Means all the Motions of the _Pecten_ are easily communicated to the
_vitreous Humour_, and indeed to all contained in the _Choroeides_. And
forasmuch as the _Crystalline_ is connected to the _vitreous Humour_,
therefore also the Alterations in the _vitreous Humour_ affect also the
_Crystalline_; and the _Crystalline_ is hereby brought nearer unto, or
farther from the _Retina_, as occasion is. Besides all which Observables
in the _Choroeides_, and inner Eye, I have also found this farther
remarkable in the _Sclerotica_, and outer-part of the Eye of Birds,
_viz._ That the fore-part of the _Sclerotica_ is horny and hard, the
middle-part thin and flexible, and _Braces_ intervene between the fore
and hind-part, running between the _Choroeides_ and _Sclerotica_; by
which Means the _Cornea_, and back-part of the Eye, are brought to the
same Conformity, that the rest of the Eye hath.

The great End and Design of this singular and curious _Apparatus_ in
the Eyes, both of Birds and Fishes, I take to be, 1. To enable those
Creatures to see at all Distances, far off, or nigh; which (especially in
the Waters) requireth a different Conformation of the Eye. In Birds also,
this is of great Use, to enable them to see their Food at their Bill’s
End, or to reach the utmost Distances their high Flights enable them
to view; as to see over great Tracts of Sea or Land, whither they have
occasion to fly; or to see their Food or Prey, even small Fishes in the
Waters, and Birds, Worms, _&c._ on the Earth, when they sit upon Trees,
high Rocks, or are hovering high in the Air. 2. To enable those Animals
to adapt their Eye to all the various Refractions of their _Medium_.
Even the Air it self varies the Refractions, according as it is rarer
or denser, more or less compressed; as is manifest from the learned and
ingenious Mr. _Lowthorp_’s Experiment in _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 257. and some
other Experiments since of the before-commended Mr. _Hawksbee_, both in
natural, rarify’d and compressed Air; in each of which, the Refractions
constantly varied in exact Proportion to the Rarity or Density of the
Air. _Vid._ _Hawksbee_’s _Exp._ pag. 175, _&c._

Besides this Conformity in general, between the Eyes of Birds and Fishes,
_Du Hamel_ tells us of a singular Conformity in the _Cormorant_’s Eye,
and that is, that the _Crystalline_ is globous, as in Fishes, to enable
it to see and pursue its Prey under Water: Which _J. Faber_, in Mr.
_Willoughby_ saith, they do _with wonderful Swiftness, and for a long
Time_. Will. Ornithol. p. 329.

[ee] The _Crystalline Humour_, when dry’d, doth manifestly enough appear
to be made up of many very thin spherical _Laminæ_, or Scales lying one
upon another. Mr. _Lewenhock_ reckons there may be 2000 of them in one
_Crystalline_, from the outermost to the Center. Every one of these
Scales, he saith, he hath discovered to be made up of one single Fibre,
or finest Thread wound, in a most stupendous Manner, this way, and that
way, so as to run several Courses, and meet in as many Centers, and yet
not to interfere, or cross one another, in any one Place. In _Oxen_,
_Sheep_, _Hogs_, _Dogs_ and _Cats_, the Thread spreads into three several
Courses, and makes as many Centers: In _Whales_ five; but in _Hares_ and
_Rabbets_ only two. In the whole Surface of an _Ox_’s _Crystalline_, he
reckons there are more than 12000 Fibres juxtaposited. For the right and
clear Understanding of the Manner of which admirable Piece of Mechanism,
I shall refer to his Cuts and Descriptions in _Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ. 165.
and 293. The Truth hereof I have heard some ingenious Men question; but
it is what I my self have seen, and can shew to any Body, with the Help
of a good Microscope.

[ff] _S. Malpighi_ observed the Middle of the _optick Nerve_ of the
_Sword-Fish_, to be nothing else but a large Membrane, folded according
to its Length in many Doubles, almost like a Fan, and invested by the
_Dura mater_; whereas in Land-Animals it is a Bundle of Fibres. _V._

[ii] Among all the other Security the Eye hath, we may reckon the
Reparation of the _aqueous Humour_; by which Means the Eye when
wounded, and that in all Appearance very dangerously too, doth often
recover its Sight: Of which _Bern. Verzascha_ gives divers Examples
ancient and modern. One is from _Galen_, of a Boy so wounded, that the
_Cornea_ fell, and became flaccid, but yet recovered his Sight. Other
such like Instances also he gives from _Realdus Columbus_, _Rhodius_,
and _Tulpius_; and one that he cured himself in these Words, _Ego in
Nobilissimi viri filiolâ similem casum observavi: hæc dum levibus
de causis cum fratre altercaret, iste iracundiâ percitus cultellum

Another Cure of this kind, was experimented by Dr. _Daniel Major_, upon a
Goose, Ann. 1670, the _aqueous Humour_ of both whose Eyes they let out,
so that the Eyes fell, and the _Goose_ became quite blind: But without
the Use of any Medicine, in about two Days Time, Nature repaired the
watery Humour again, the Eyes returned to their Former Turgency, and the
_Goose_ was in a Week after produced seeing before twenty eight or thirty
Spectators. _Ephem. Germ._ T. 1. Add. ad. Obs. 117.

From the same Cause, I doubt not, it was that the Eye of a Gentleman’s
Daughter, and those of a Cock, when wounded, so that the _Cornea_ sunk,
were restored by a _Lithuanian_ Chymist, that passed for a Conjurer, by
the Use of a Liquor found in _May_, in the Vesiculæ of _Elm_. Of which
see Mr. _Ray’s Catal. Cantab._ in _Ulmus_ from _Henr. ab Heers_.

_Tully_, in the Person of a _Stoick_, having so well accounted for
the Use of the _Eye-Lids_, I shall for a further Manifestation of the
Creator’s Contrivance and Structure of them, take notice of two or three
Things: 1. They consist of a thin and flexible, but strong Skin, by which
means they the better wipe, clean, and guard the _Cornea_. 2. Their Edges
are fortified with a soft _Cartilage_, by which means they are not only
enabled the better to do their Office, but also to close and shut the
better. 3. Out of these Cartilages grow a Pallisade of stiff Hairs, of
great Use to warn the Eye of the Invasion of Dangers, to keep off Motes,
and to shut out too excessive Light, _&c._ and at the same time to admit
of (through their Intervals) a sufficient Passage for Objects to approach
the Eye. And it is remarkable, that these Hairs grow but to a certain,
commodious Length, and need no cutting, as many other Hairs of the Body
do: Also, that their Points stand out of the way, and in the upper-lid
bend upwards, as they do downwards in the lower lid, whereby they are
well adapted to their Use. From which last Observables, we may learn how
critical and nice the great Author of Nature hath been, in even the least
and most trivial Conveniencies belonging to Animal Bodies; for which
Reason I have added it to _Tully_’s Remarks. And more might have been
added too, as particularly concerning the curious Structure and Lodgment
of the _Right Muscle_, which opens the Eye-Lids; and the _Orbicularis_,
or _Circular_ one, that shuts them; the nice _Apparatus_ of Glands that
keep the Eye moist, and serve for _Tears_; together with the Reason why
Man alone, who is a social Animal, doth exhibit his social Affections
by such outward Tokens as _Tears_; the _Nerves_ also, and other Organs
acting in this Ministry. I might also speak of the Passages for
discharging the superfluous Moisture of the Eyes through the Nostrils,
and much more of the like kind. But it would take up too much Room in
these Notes; and therefore it shall suffice to give only such Hints as
may create a Suspicion of a noble Œconomy and Contrivance in this (I had
almost said) least considerable part of the Eye. But for Particulars I
shall refer to the Anatomists; and for some of these Things, particularly
to Dr. _Willis_’s _Cereb. Anat._ and _de Anim. Brut._ and Mr. _Cowper_’s

To the Eye-Lids we may add another Guard afforded the Eyes of most
Quadrupeds, Birds, and Fishes, by the _nictitating Membrane_, which Dr.
_Willis_ gives this Account of, _Plurimis ~[Animalibus]~ quibus Musculus
suspensorius adest_ (which Limitation he needed not to have added)
_etiam alter Membranosus conceditur, qui juxta interiorem oculi canthum
situs, quando elevatur, Oculi globum ferè totum obtegit. Hujus usus esse
videtur, ut cùm Bestiæ inter gramina, ~&c.~ capita sua propter victum
capessendum demergunt, hic Musculus Oculi Pupillam, nè à stipularum
incursu seriatur, oculit, munitque._ De Anim. Brut. p. 1. c. 15.

This Membrane Man hath not, he having little Occasion to thrust his
Head into such Places of Annoyance, as Beasts and other Animals; or if
he hath, he can defend his Eyes with his Hands. But Birds (who frequent
Trees and Bushes) and Quadrupeds, (Hedges and long Grass) and who have no
part ready, like the Hand, to fence off Annoyances; these, I say, have
this incomparable Provision made for the Safety of their Eyes. And for
Fishes, as they are destitute of Eye-Lids, because in the Waters there is
no occasion for a Defensative against Dust and Motes, offensive to the
Eyes of Land Animals, nor to moisten and wipe the Eyes, as the Eye-Lids
do, so the _Nictitating-Membrane_ is an abundant Provision for all their
Occasions, without the Addition of the Eye-Lids.

And now, if we reflect, are these the Works of any Thing but a wise and
indulgent Agent?

[ll] Although the Hardness and Firmness of the _Adnata_, or _Sclerotica_
in Birds, is a good Guard to their Eyes, yet I do not think it is made
thus, so much for a Defence, as to minister to the lengthning and
shortning the Eye, mentioned before in _Note (cc)._

[mm] _Cochleis oculorum vicem Cornicula bina pratentu implent._ Plin.
Nat. Hist. l. 11. c. 37. See more of the Eyes of _Snails_ before in _Note
(k)_; and in _Note (l)_, I said that I suspected _Moles_ also might
thrust out, or withdraw their Eyes more or less within the Hair or Skin.

[nn] The diligent _Sturmius_ was fully persuaded there could not be any
speculative Atheism in any one that should well survey the Eye. _Nobis_,
saith he, _fuit persuasissimum. Atheismum, quem vocant speculativum, h.
e. obsirmatam de Deitate in Universo nullâ persuasionem, habere locum
aut inveniri non posse in eo homine, qui vel unius corporis organici, &

[oo] The glorious Landskips, and other Objects that present themselves
to the Eye, are manifestly painted on the _Retina_, and that not erect,
but inverted as the Laws of Opticks require; and is manifest to the Eye
from _Monsieur Cartes_’s Experiment, of laying bare the vitreous Humour
on the back part of the Eye, and clapping over it a Bit of white Paper,
or the Skin of an Egg; and then placing the fore-part of the Eye to the
Hole of the Window of a darkned Room. By which means we have a pretty
Landskip of the Objects abroad invertedly painted on the Paper, on the
back of the Eye. But now the Question is, How in this Case the Eye comes
to see the Objects erect? _Monsieur Cartes_’s Answer is, _Notitia illius
ex nullâ imagine pendet, nec ex ullâ actione ab objectis veniente, sed ex
solo situ exiguarum partium cerebri, è quibus Nervi expullulant.——E.g.
cogitandum in Oculo——situm capillamenti nervi optici——respondere ad
alium quendam partis cerebri——qui facit ut Anima singula loca cognoscat,
quæ jacent in rectâ, aut quasi rectâ lineæ; ut ita mirari non debeamus
corpora in naturali situ videri, quamvis imago in oculo delineata
contrarium habeat._ Dioptr. c. 6. But our most ingenious Mr. _Molyneux_
answereth thus, _The Eye is only the Organ or Instrument, ’tis the Soul
that sees by means of the Eye. To enquire then how the Soul perceives
the Object erect, by an inverted Image, is to enquire into the Soul’s
Faculties——But erect and inverted are only Terms of Relation to up and
down; or farther from, or nigher to the Center of the Earth, in Parts
of the same Thing.——But the Eye, or visive Faculty takes no notice of
the internal Posture of its own Parts, but useth them as an Instrument
only, contrived by Nature for the Exercise of such a Faculty.——Let us
imagine, that the Eye ~(on its lower Part)~ receives an Impulse ~[by a
Ray from the upper part of the Object]~ must not the visive Faculty be
necessarily directed hereby to consider this Stroke, as coming from the
top rather than the bottom ~[of the Object]~ and consequently be directed
to conclude it the Representation of the top? Hereof we may be satisfied,
by supposing a Man standing on his Head. For here, though the upper Parts
of Objects are painted on the upper Parts of the Eye, yet the Objects are
judged to be erect. What is said of Erect and Reverse, may be understood
of Sinister and Dexter._ Molyneux’s Dioptr. Nov. Part I. Prop. 28.




CHAP. III.

_Of the Sense of Hearing._


Concerning the Sense of _Hearing_, I shall take notice of two Things, the
Organ, the _Ear_; and its Object, _Sound_.

I. For the Organ, the _Ear_; I shall pass by its convenient Number of
being double, which (as in the last Sense) serves for the commodious
Hearing every way round us; as also a wise Provision for the utter Loss
or Injury[a] of one of the Ears. But I shall a little insist upon its
Situation, and its admirable Fabrick and Parts.

1. It is situated in the most convenient Part of the Body, (like as I
said the Eye is) in a Part near the common Sensory in the Brain, to give
the more speedy Information; in a Part where it can be best guarded, and
where it is most free from Annoyances and Harms it self, and where it
gives the least Annoyance and Hindrance to the Exercises of any other
Part; in a Part appropriated to the peculiar Use of the principal Senses,
in the most lofty, eminent Part of the Body, where it can perceive the
most Objects, and receive the greatest Information: And lastly, in a
Part in the Neighbourhood of its Sister Sense the Eye, with whom it
hath peculiar and admirable Communication by its Nerves, as I intend to
shew in its proper Place. In respect then of its Situation and Place in
the Body, this Sense is well designed and contrived, and may so far be
accounted the Work of some admirable Artist. But,

2. If we survey its Fabrick and Parts, it will appear to be an admirable
Piece of the Divine Wisdom, Art, and Power. For the Manifestation of
which, let us distinctly survey the outward and the inward Part of its
curious Organ.

1. For the _outward Ear_: If we observe its Structure in all Kinds of
Animals, it must needs be acknowledged to be admirably Artificial,
it being so nicely prepared, and adjusted to the peculiar Occasions
of each respective Animal. In Man[b], it is of a Form proper for the
erect Posture of his Body. In Birds, of a Form proper for Flight; not
protuberant, because that would obstruct their Progress, but close and
covered, to afford the easier Passage through the Air. In Quadrupeds,
its Form is agreeable to the Posture, and slower Motion of their Bodies;
and in these too, various, according to their various Occasions. In some
large, erect, and open, to hear the least Approaches of Dangers[c],
in others covered, to keep out noxious Bodies. In the Subterraneous
Quadrupeds, who are forced to mine, and dig for their Food and
Habitation, as a protuberant Ear, like that of other Quadrupeds, would
obstruct their Labours, and be apt to be torn and injured; so they have
the contrary[d], their Ears short, lodged deep and backward in their
Head, and passing to the under Part thereof, and all sufficiently fenced
and guarded. And as for Insects, Reptiles, and the Inhabitants of the
Waters, if they enjoy this Sense, (as there is great Reason to think they
do,) it may probably be lodged commodiously under the same Security and
Guard, as the Smelling, or some other Sense is.

And moreover, as the Form of this Organ is various in various Animals,
so in each of them its Structure is very curious and observable, being
in all admirably contrived to collect the wandering, circumambient
Impressions, and Undulations of Sound, and to convey them to the Sensory
within. If I should run over the several _Genera_ of Animals, we might
find a notable Prospect of the handy-work of God[e], even in this so
inconsiderable Part of Animals. But I shall only carry my Survey to that
of Man. And here the first Thing that offereth it self to our View, is
the _Helix_, with its tortuous Cavities, made to stop, and collect the
sonorous Undulations, to give them a gentle Circulation and Refraction,
and so convey them to the _Concha_, or larger and more capacious round
Cell at the Entrance of the Ear. And to bridle the Evagation of the
Sound, when arrived so far, but withal not to make a Confusion thereof,
by any disagreeable Repercussions, we may take notice of a very curious
Provision in those little Protuberances, called the _Tragus_, and
_Antitragus_ of the outward Ear, of a commodious Form and Texture[f], and
conveniently lodged for this Use. The great Convenience and Benefit of
this Form and Contrivance of the outward Ear, is sufficiently manifest
by the want thereof, which causeth a _Confusion in the Hearing, with a
certain Murmur, or Swooing like the Fall of Waters_[g].

Another wise Provision of the Creator, is in the Substance of the outward
Ear, which is cartilaginous, the fittest for this Place. For (as an
ingenious Anatomist[h] observes) “If it had been Bone, it would have been
troublesome, and might by many Accidents have been broken off: If Flesh,
it would have been subject to Contusion”. But indeed a worse Consequence
than this would have ensu’d such a Softness as that of Flesh, and that
is, it would neither have remain’d expanded, neither would it so kindly
receive and circulate the Sounds, but absorb, retard, or blunt their
Progress into the inward Organ. But being hard, and curiously smooth and
tortuous, Sounds find an easie Passage, with a regular Volutation and
Refraction: As in a well-built Arch, Grotto, or musical Instrument, which
magnify and meliorate Sounds; and some of which convey even a Whisper to
a large Distance[i]: But from the outward, let us carry our Survey,

2. To the inward Part of this admirable Organ. And here we find the
most curious and artful Provision for every Emergency and Occasion. The
_auditory Passage_, in the first Place, curiously tunnelled, and artfully
turned, to give Sounds an easie Passage, as well as a gentle Circulation
and Refraction; but withal, so as to prevent their too furious rushing
in, and assaulting the more tender Parts within.

And forasmuch as it is necessary that this Passage should be always
open, to be upon the Watch[k]; therefore to prevent the Invasion of
noxious Insects, or other Animals, (who are apt to make their retreat in
every little Hole), Nature hath secured this Passage[l], with a bitter
nauseous Excrement[m], afforded from the Glands[n] appointed for that
Purpose.

From hence let us approach the most inward Parts, in which we shall see
Strokes of the most exquisite Art. To pass over the _innate Air_, that
most Authors talk of[o], (because there is no such) the passage to the
Palate[p], and their Uses, with divers other curious Things that might
be named; let us stop a little at the Part containing the rest, namely,
the Bone[q]. The particular Texture and Hardness of which, above other
Bones of the Body, is very remarkable; whereby it serves not only as a
substantial Guard to the Sensory, but also to oppose the Impulses of the
ætherial Matter, that there may be no loss, nor Confusion in the Sound;
but that it may be conveyed regularly, and intirely to the auditory
Nerves.

The next Part I shall take Notice of, may be that fine Membrane, called
the _Tympanum_, or _Membrana Tympani_[r], with its inner Membrane[s];
together with the four little appendent Bones[t], and the three inner
Muscles to move them, and adjust the whole _Compages_ to the several
Purposes of Hearing, to hear all Manner of Sounds, loud or languid,
harsh or grateful[u].

From this Region of the _Tympanum_, I might pass to that of the
_Labyrinth_[w], and therein survey the curious and admirable Structure
of the _Vestibulum_, the _Semicircular Canals_[x], and _Cochlea_;
particularly the artificial Gyrations, and other singular Curiosities
observable in the two latter.

But I shall not expatiate on these recluse Parts; only there is one
special Contrivance of the Nerves, ministring to this Sense of Hearing,
which must not be passed by; and that is, the Branches of one of the
_auditory Nerves_[y], spread partly to the Muscles of the Ear, partly to
the Eye, partly to the Tongue and Instruments of Speech, and inosculated
with the Nerves to go to the Heart and Breast. By which Means there is an
admirable, and useful Content between these Parts of the Body; it being
natural for most Animals, upon the Hearing any uncouth Sound, to erect
their Ears, and prepare them to catch every Sound; to open their Eyes
(those constant faithful Sentinels) to stand upon their Watch; and to
be ready with the Mouth to call out, or utter what the present Occasion
shall dictate. And accordingly it is very usual for most Animals, when
surpriz’d, and terrify’d with any Noise, presently to shriek and cry out.

But there is besides this, in Man, another great Use of this nervous
Commerce between the Ear and Mouth: And that is, (as one of the best
Authors on this Subject expresseth it)[z], “That the Voice may correspond
with the Hearing, and be a kind of Echo thereof, that what is _heard_
with _one_ of the two Nerves, may be readily expressed with the Voice, by
the help of the _other_.”

Thus much shall suffice to have spoken concerning the Organ. Let us,

II. Take Notice of the _Object_ of this admirable Sense, namely, _Sound_;
and so conclude this Chapter. I shall not here enquire into the Nature
and Properties of _Sound_, which is in a great Measure intricate, and
hath puzzelled the best Naturalists: Neither shall I shew how this
admirable Effect of the divine Contrivance, may be improv’d to divers
Uses[aa] and Purposes in humane Life; but my Business will be to shew
that this Thing, of so admirable Use in the animal World, is the Work of
God. And this will appear, let the subject Matter of Sounds be what it
will; either the Atmosphere[bb] in Gross, or the ætherial Part thereof,
or soniferous Particles of Bodies, as some fancy, or whatever else the
Philosopher may think it. For who but an intelligent Being, what less
than an omnipotent and infinitely wise God could contrive, and make
such a fine Body, such a Medium, so susceptible of every Impression,
that the Sense of Hearing hath occasion for, to empower all Animals to
express their Sense and Meaning to others; to make known their Fears,
their Wants, their Pains and Sorrows in melancholick Tones; their Joys
and Pleasures in more harmonious Notes; to send their Minds at great
Distances[cc], in a short Time[dd], in loud Boations; or to express their
Thoughts near at hand with a gentle Voice, or in secret Whispers! And to
say no more, who less than the same most wise and indulgent Creator,
could form such an Oeconomy, as that of Melody and Musick is! That the
_Medium_ should (as I said) so readily receive every Impression of
Sound, and convey the melodious Vibration of every musical String, the
harmonious Pulses of every animal Voice, and of every musical Pipe; and
the Ear be as well adapted, and ready to receive all these Impressions,
as the _Medium_ to convey them: And lastly, that by Means of the curious
Lodgment, and Inosculations of the _auditory Nerves_ before-mentioned,
the Orgasms of the Spirits should be allay’d, and Perturbations of the
Mind, in a great Measure quieted and stilled[ee]: Or to express it in
the Words of the last-cited famous Author[ff], “That Musick should not
only affect the Fancy with Delight; but also give Relief to the Grief and
Sadness of the Heart; yea, appease all those turbulent Passions, which
are excited in the Breast by an immoderate Ferment, and Fluctuation of
the Blood”.

And now, who can reflect upon all this curious Apparatus of the _Sense of
Hearing_, and not give the great Creator his due Praise! Who can survey
all this admirable Work, and not as readily own it to be the Work of an
omnipotent, and infinitely wise and good _GOD_[gg], as the most artful
Melodies we hear, are the Voice or Performances of a living Creature!

FOOTNOTES:

[a] I presume it will not be ungrateful to take notice here of the
admirable, as well as useful Sagacity of some deaf Persons, that have
learnt to supply their want of _Hearing_ by understanding what is said
by the Motion of the Lips. My very ingenious Friend Mr. _Waller_, _R. S.
Secr._ gives this Account, _There live now and have from their Birth,
in our Town, a Man and his Sister, each about fifty Years old, neither
of which have the least Sense of Hearing,——yet both of these know, by
the Motion of the Lips only, whatever is said to them, and will answer
pertinently to the Question proposed to them——The Mother told me they
could hear very well, and speak when they were Children, but both lost
that Sense afterwards, which makes them retain their Speech; though
that, to Persons not used to them, is a little uncouth and odd, but
intelligible enough._ Phil. Trans. No. 312.

Such another Instance is that of Mr. _Goddy_, Minister of St. _Gervais_
in _Geneva_, his Daughter. _She is now about sixteen Years old. Her Nurse
had an extraordinary Thickness of Hearing; at a Year old, the Child spake
all those little Words that Children begin to speak at that Age.——At two
Years old, they perceived she had lost her Hearing, and was so Deaf, that
ever since, though she hears great Noises, yet she hears nothing that one
can speak to her.——But by observing the Motions of the Mouth and Lips
of others, she hath acquired so many Words, that out of these she hath
formed a sort of Jargon, in which she can hold Conversation whole Days
with those that can speak her own Language. I could understand some of
her Words, but could not comprehend a Period, for it seemed to be but a
confused Noise. She knows nothing that is said to her, unless she seeth
the Motion of their Mouths that speak to her; so that in the Night, when
it is necessary to speak to her, they must light a Candle. Only one thing
appeared the strangest part of the whole Narration: She hath a Sister,
with whom she hath practised her Language more than with any other: And
in the Night, by laying her Hand on her Sister’s Mouth, she can perceive
by that what she saith, and so can discourse with her in the Night._
Bishop _Burnet_’s Let. 4. p. 248.

[b] I cannot but admire that our most eminent modern Anatomists should
not agree, whether there be any Muscles in the outward Ear of Man or
not. Dr. _Keil_ saith there are two; Dr. _Drake_ the same Number; and
Dr. _Gibson_ makes them to be four. So also doth _Monsieur Dionis_, and
so did the ancient Anatomists: But Dr. _Schelhammer_ expressly denies
there are any, and saith, _Seduxit autem reliquos Brutorum Anatome,
in quorum plerisque tales Musculi plures inveniuntur; putârunt autem
fortassis ignominiosum Homini, si non & his instructus esset, & minùs
inde perfectum animal fore._ Schel. de Auditu p. 1. c. 1. §. 7. But
_Valsalva_, who wrote very lately, and is very accurate in his Survey
of the Ear, saith, _Musculi auriculæ posteriores quandoque quatuor,
quandoque duo; sed ut plurimùm tres adnotantur; & quando solùm duo se
manifestant, tunc unus ex illis duplicato tendine versùs Concham deferri
solet. Horum musculorum in numero varietatem non solùm in diversis; verùm
etiam in eodem subjecto quandoque vidi——Ex quibus differentiis subortæ
sunt Auctorum discrepantiæ in horum Musculorum numero, & positu:——quod
non evenisset, si pluries in diversis Corporibus iidem Musculi quæsiti
essent._ Ant. Mar. _Valsalva de Aur. Human._ c. 1. §. 6. But Dr. _Drake_
thinks some of _Valsalva_’s Muscles the Product of Fancy. Mr. _Cowper_
makes them to be three, one _Attollent_, and two _Retrabent Muscles_. See
_Anat._ Tab. 12.

[c] _Inter cætera ~[animalia aurita]~ maximè admirabilis est auris
leporinæ fabrica, quod cùm timidissimum animal sit, & prorsus inerme,
natura id tum auditu acurissimo, tanquam hostium exploratore ad
perfentienda pericula, tum pedibus ceu armis ad currendum aptis munisse
videtur._ A. Kircher’s _Phonurg._ l. 1. §. 7. Technas. 2.

[d] _Moles_ have no protuberant Ear, but only a round Hole between the
Neck and Shoulder; which Situation of it, together with the thick,
short Fur that covers it, is a sufficient Defensative against external
Annoyances. The _Meatus Auditorius_ is long, round and cartilaginous,
reaching to the under part of the Skull. Round the inside runs a little
Ridge, resembling two Threads of a Skrew; at the Bottom whereof is a
pretty Inlet, leading to the Drum, made, on one side with the aforesaid
cochleous Ridge, and on the other, with a small Cartilage. I observed
there was _Cerumen_ in the _Meatus_.

As to the _inner Ear_, it is somewhat singular, and different from that
of the other Quadrupeds, and much more from Birds, although I have met
with some Authors that make it agreeing with that of Birds. There are
three small Bones only (all hollow) by which the _Drum_ (to use the
old Appellation) or the _Membrana Tympani_ (as others call it) acteth
upon the _Auditory Nerve_. The first is the _Malleus_, which hath two
Processes nearly of equal Length; the longer of which is braced to
the _Membrana Tympani_, the shorter to the side of the _Drum_ or _Os
Petrosum_; the back part of it resembles the Head and Stalk of a small
_Mushroom_, such as are pickled. On the back of the _Malleus_ lies the
next small Bone, which may be called the _Incus_, long, and without any
Process, having somewhat the Form of the short Scoop wherewith Water-men
throw the Water out of their Wherries. To the end of this the third and
last small Bone is tacked by a very tender Brace. This little Bone bears
the Office of the _Stapes_, but is only forked without any Base. One of
these Forks is at one _Fenestra_, or _Foramen_, the other at another; in
which _Fenestra_ I apprehend the Forks are tacked to the Auditory Nerve.
These _Fenestra_ (equivalent to the _Fenestra Ovalis_, and _Rotunda_ in
others) are the Inlets into the _Cochlea_ and _Canales Semicirculares_,
in which the _Auditory Nerve_ lieth. The _Semicircular Canales_ lie at a
distance from the _Drum_, and are not lodged (as in other Animals) in a
strong, thick Body of Bone, but are thrust out, within the Skull, making
an _Antrum_, with an handsome _Arch_ leading into it, into which a part
of the Brain enters.

One Leg of the _Malleus_ being fastned to the _Membrana Tympani_, and the
_Incus_ to the back of the _Malleus_, and the top of that to the top of
the _Stapes_, and the Forks or Branches of the _Stapes_ to the _Auditory
Nerve_, I observed that whenever I moved the Membrane, all the little
Bones were at the same time moved, and consequently the _Auditory Nerve_
thereby affected also.

I hope the Reader will excuse me for being so particular in this Organ
only of the _Mole_, a despised Creature, but as notable an Example of
_God_’s Work, as its Life is different from that of other Quadrupeds; for
which Reason it partly is that I have enlarged on this part differing
from that of others, and which no Body that I know of, hath taken much
notice of, and which is not discoverable without great Patience and
Application; and partly because by comparing these Observations with
_Book VII. Chap. 2. Note (d)_, we may judge how the Sense of Hearing is
performed.

[e] _Among many Varieties, both in the inner and outer Ear, those which
appear in the Passage into the Rock-Bone, are remarkable. For in an ~Owl~,
that perches on a Tree or Beam, and hearkens after the Prey beneath
her, it is produced farther out above than it is below, for the better
Reception of the least Sound. But in a Fox, that scouteth underneath the
Prey at Roost; it is for the same Reason, produced farther out below. In
a ~Pole-Cat~, which hearkens strait forward, it is produced behind, for
the taking of a forward Sound. Whereas in a ~Hare~, which is very quick
of Hearing, and thinks of nothing but being pursued, it is supplied with
a bony Tube, which as a natural Otocoustick, is so directed backward, as
to receive the smallest and most distant Sound that comes behind her._
Grew’s Cosmolog. Sacr. _lib. 1. c. 5. §. 6_.

[f] The Texture of the _Tragus_ and _Antitragus_, is softer than that of
the _Helix_, which serveth gently to blunt, not forcibly to repel the
Sound in the _Concha_.

[g] Dr. _Gibson_’s Anatomy, _Chap. 22. Book III_.

_Those whose Ears are cut off, have but a confused way of Hearing, and
are obliged either to form a Cavity round the Ear with their own Hands,
or else to make use of a Horn, and apply the end of it to the inner
Cavity of the Ear, on order to receive the agitated Air. ’Tis likewise
observed, that those whose Ears jut out, hear better than flat-eared
Persons_. Monsieur Dionis’s _Anat. Demonstr. 8_.

[h] _Gibs._ Ibid.

[i] It would nauseate the Reader to reckon up the Places famed for the
Conveyance of Whispers, such as the Prison of _Dionysius_ at _Syracuse_,
which is said to encrease a Whisper to a Noise; the clapping ones Hands
to the Sound of a Cannon, &c. Nor the _Aquaducts_ of _Claudius_, which
carry a Voice sixteen Miles, and many others both Ancient and Modern. If
the Reader hath a mind to be entertained in this way, he may find enough
in _Kircher_’s _Phonurgia_. But it may not be irksome to mention one or
two of our own in _England_. Among which, one of the most famed is the
_Whispering-Place_ in _Gloucester Cathedral_, which is no other than a
Gallery above the East-end of the Choir, leading from one side thereof
to the other. It consisteth, (if I mistake not) of five Angles, and six
Sides, the middle-most of which is a naked, uncovered Window, looking
into a Chapel behind it. I guess the two Whisperers stand at about twenty
five Yards Distance from one another. But the _Dome_ of St. _Paul_’s,
_London_, is a more considerable _Whispering-Place_, where the ticking
of a Watch (when no Noise is in the Streets) may be heard from Side to
Side; yea, a Whisper may be sent all round the _Dome_. And not only in
the Gallery below, but above, upon the Scaffold, I tried, and found that
a Whisper would be carried over one’s Head round the top of the Arch,
notwithstanding there is a large Opening in the middle of it into the
upper part of the _Dome_.

[k] _Auditus autem semper patet: ejus enim sensu etiam dormientes egemus:
A quo cùm sonus est acceptus, etiam è somno excitamur. Flexuosum iter
habet, nè quid intrare possit, si simplex, & directum pateret; provisum
etiam, ut siqua minima bestiola conaretur irrumpere, in sordibus aurium,
tanquàm in visco, inhæresceret._ Cicer. de Nat. Deor. l. 2. c. 57.

It deserves a particular Remark here, that in Infants in the Womb, and
newly born, the _Meatus Auditorius_ is shut up very closely, partly by
the Constriction of the Passage, and partly by a glutinous Substance,
whereby the _Tympanum_ is guarded against the Water in the _Secundine_,
and against the Injuries of the Air as soon as the Infant is born.

[l] It is remarkable, that in most, if not all Animals, whose Ears are
tunnelled, or where the _Meatus Auditorius_ is long enough to afford
Harbour to _Ear-wigs_, or other Insects; that, I say, in the Ears of
such, _Ear-wax_ is constantly to be found. But in Birds, whose Ears are
covered with Feathers, and where the _Tympanum_ lies but a little way
within the Skull, no _Ear-wax_ is found, because none is necessary to the
Ears so well guarded, and so little tunnelled.

[m] The _Ear-wax_ was thought by the old Anatomists to be an Excrement of
the Brain: _Humor biliosus à cerebro expugnatus_, the _Bartholines_ say
of it, l. 3. _c. 9._ But as _Schelhammer_ well observes, _Nil absurdius,
quàm cerebri excrementum hoc statuere. Nam & ratio nulla suadet, ut in
cerebro fieri excrementum tale credamus:——neque viæ patent per quas ab eo
seclusum in meatum auditorium possit inde penetrare._ As to its Taste,
_Casserius_ gives Instances of its being sweet in some Creatures. But
_Schelhammer_ says, _Ego verò semper, cum amaritie aliquid dulcedinis in
illo deprehendi_. Vid. Schel. de Audit. _p. 1. c. 2. §. 10_. But I could
never distinguish any Sweetness in it; but think it insipid mixed with a
Bitterness.

1. c. 14_. _In the Skin——are little Glands, which furnish a yellow and
bitter Humour._ Monsieur Dionis’s Dem. 18. An handsome Cut of those
_Glandulæ ceruminosæ_ is in Dr. _Drake_, from _Valsalva_.

_Pliny_ attributes a great Virtue to the _Ear-wax_; _Morsus hominis inter
asperrimos numeratur: medentur sordes ex auribus: ac ne quis miretur,
etiam Scorpionum ictibus Serpentiumque statim impositæ._ Plin. Nat. Hist.
_l. 28. c. 4_. And that it hath an healing Quality, and may be accounted
a good Balsam, I my self have experienced.

[o] That there is such a Thing as the _innate Air_, (talked of much by
most Authors on this Subject) _Schelhammer_ very justly, I think, denies,
by Reason there is a Passage into the inner Ear from the Throat, through
which the _innate Air_ may pass out, and the outward Air enter in. _V._
_Par. Alt._ p. 2. c. 1. §. 10. When by stopping our Breath, and Straining,
we force the external Air into the Ear, it may be heard rushing in; and
if much be forced in, it may be felt also to beat against the _Tympanum_.
When the Passage to the Throat is by any Means stopp’d, as by a Cold in
the Head, &c. the Hearing thereby becomes dull and blunt; by Reason the
Communication between the outward and inward Air are obstructed: But when
by strong Swallowing, or such-like Motion of the Throat, the Passage is
opened, we perceive it by a sudden Smack or Crack, and we immediately
hear very clearly; the load of feculent Air being at that Time discharged
from the inner Ear.

It is a wise Provision, that the Passage for the Air into the Ear, is
from the Throat; _Ut non statim quivis aer externus irrumpere queat_ (as
_Schelhammer_ saith, _Par. Ult. c. 4. §. 8._) _sed nonnihil immutatus, ac
temperatus, calore ex medio ventre exspirante; imò fortassis non facilè
alius, nisi ex pulmonibus._

[p] _Valsalva_ hath given us a more accurate Description of the _Tuba
Eustachiana_, or _Passage to the Palate_, than any other Author, to whom
I therefore refer, _De Aur. Human._ c. 2. §. 16, _&c._

The chief Use hereof, he thinks, is to give way to the inner Air, upon
every Motion of the _Membrana Tympani_, the _Malleus_, _Incus_ and
_Stapes_. This Passage, if it be shut up, Deafness ensues: Of which he
gives two Instances: One a Gentleman, who lost his Hearing by a Polypus
in the Nose reaching to the _Uvula_; the other a Yeoman, labouring with
an Ulcer above the left Side of the _Uvula_; which when he stopt with
a Tent dipped in Medicine, he lost his Hearing in the left Ear, and
recovered it, as soon as the Tent was out. _Ibid. c. 5. §. 10._

impressionibus onusta, dum prædictis impingitur Parietibus, nihil aut

sonoris accepit, talem communicet spiritui animali contento intra
expansiones rami mollioris Nervorum auris._ Dr. _Raym. Vieussens_ of
_Montpellier_, in Phil. Trans. Nᵒ. 258.

[r] The _Tympanum_ of the Ear, or as _Valsalva_ and the Moderns, the
_Membrana Tympani_ was taken notice of as early as _Hippocrates_’s Time.
In Birds, it is strained towards the outward Parts; in other Animals
towards the Brain, or inner Parts. Monsieur _Dionis_ saith, _It is not
equally fastened to the whole Circumference of the bony Circle, in which
it is inchased; for on the upper Side it hath a free disengaged Part,
by which some can give vent to the Smoak in their Mouth._ Demonstr. 8.
That there is some Passage I doubt not, but I question whether Monsieur
_Dionis_ ever saw the disengaged Part he mentions. I have my self
carefully searched divers Subjects, and do not remember to have seen any
such Passage; and I perceive it escaped the diligent _Schelhammer_’s Eye.
_Valsalva_ also by injecting in through the _Tuba Eustachiana_, could
not force any Liquor into the _Meatus Auditorius_; but yet he imagines
he found the Passage out in another Place of the Drum, in some morbid,
and one sound Head. _Valsalv. de Aur. Hum._ c. 2. §. 8. Mr. _Cowper_ also
affirms there is a Passage by the upper Part of the Membrane. _Anat. Ap._
Fig. 8.

[s] Dr. _Vieussens_, before-named, discovered a Membrane,
_tenuissimæ raræque admodùm texturæ intra cavitatem Tympani_; as
he describes it. Whose use he saith is, _1. Occludens Labyrinthi
januam impedit nè naturalis purissimus ac subtilissimus Aer intra
cavitates——communicationem——habeat cum aere crasso. 2. Labyrinthi basin
calefacit, ~&c.~ ubi supra._ Probably this double Membrane may be such,
or after the same Manner as it is in the _Tympanum_ of Birds: Of which
see my Observations in _Book VII. Chap. 2. Note (d)._

[t] The four little Bones being treated of by all that have concerned
themselves about this Sense of Hearing, since their Discovery, I shall
take Notice of only two Things concerning them. 1. The Discovery of them
is owing wholly to the Diligence and Sagacity of the latter Ages; of
which _Schelhammer_ gives this Account from _Fallopius_, _Hæc Officula
antiquis Anatomicis——ignota fuere; primusque qui in lucem produxit
~[Malleum & Incum]~ fuit Jac. Carpensis; primus quoque procul omni dubio

Siculus, Philosophus ac Medicus doctissimus. Quartum, Thomâ Bartholin.

c. 3. §. 9. 2. Their Difference in Animals: In _Man_, and _Quadrupeds_,
they are four, curiously inarticulated with one another; with an external
and internal Muscle to draw, or work them, in extending, or relaxing the
_Drum_; but in _Fowls_ the Case is very different: _His unum Ossiculum
solùm largita est Natura, quod Collumellam fortè appellaveris: teres enim
est & subtilissimum, basi innitens latiori, rotundæ. Huic adnexa est
cartilago valde mobilis, quæ in Tympanum videtur terminari._ Id. Ib. §.
8. _In the Ears of all the Fowl that I could examine, I never found any
more than one Bone, and a Cartilage, making a Joynt with it, that was
easily moveable. The Cartilage had generally an Epiphyse, or two, one on
each Side.——The Bone was very hard and small, having at the end of it a
broad Plate, of the same Substance, very thin, upon which it rested, as
on its Basis._ Dr. _Al. Moulen_ in Phil. Trans. Nᵒ. 100.

These are the most material Things I find observed by others, concerning
the Ears of Fowls, and some of them hardly, I believe, observed before.
To which I shall subjoyn some other Things I have my self discovered,
that I presume escaped the Eyes of those most curious and inquisitive
Anatomists. Of which the last cited _Book VII. Chap. 2. Note (d)._

[u] _Videtur quòd Tympanum Auditionis instrumentum præliminare, & quasi

14.

For this Opinion of Dr. _Willis_, Dr. _Schelhammer_ is very severe upon
him, deriding the Refractions he speaks of; and therefore seriously
proves that they are the Humours, not Tunicks of the Eye, that refract
the Rays of Light; and then jeeringly demandeth, Whether the sonorous
Rays are refracted by passing through a different Medium? Whether the
Convexity or Concavity of the Drum collects those Rays into a focal
Point, or scatters them? _&c._ And then saith, _Ob has rationes à
clariss. Viri, ac de re Medicâ præclarè meriti, sententiâ non possumus
non esse alieniores; in quo uti ingenium admiror, quoties medicamentorum
vires, aut morborum causas explicat, sic ubi forum suum egressus,
Philosophum agit, ac vel Partium usum, vel Chymicarum rerum naturam
scrutetur, ejus haud semel non modò judicium desidero, verùm aliquando
etiam fidem._ This is so severe and unjust a Censure of our truly
famous Countryman, (a Man of known Probity) that might deserve a better
Answer; but I have only Time to say, that although Dr. _Schelhammer_
hath out-done all that wrote before him, in his Book _de Auditu_, and
shewed himself a Man of Learning and Industry; yet as our Countryman
wrote more than he, (though perhaps not free from Errors too) so he hath
manifested himself to have been as curious and sagacious an Anatomist,
as great a Philosopher, and as learned and skilful a Physician, as any
of his Censurers, and his Reputation for Veracity and Integrity, was no
less than any of theirs too. But after all this terrible Clamour, Dr.
_Schelhammer_ prejudicately mistaketh Dr. _Willis_’s Meaning, to say no
worse. For by _utræque Membranæ refringunt_, Dr. _Willis_ plainly enough,
I think, means no more than a Restriction of the Ingress of too many
Rays; as his following explicatory Words manifest, _viz. refringunt, &
quasi emolliunt, easque Sensorio non nisi proportionatas tradunt_. But
indeed Dr. _Schelhammer_ hath shewn himself a too rigid Censor, by making
Dr. _Willis_ say, the _Ear-Drum_ hath such like Braces as the _War-Drum_,
viz. _Quod porrò de machinis seu tæniis Tympani bellici adducit, dicitque
idem in Tympano auditorio conspici, id prorsus falsissimum est._ I wonder
Dr. _Schelhammer_ did not also charge Dr. _Willis_ with making it a
Porter, since he saith in the same Paragraph, _Janitoris officio, ~&c.~_
But Dr. _Willis_’s Meaning is plain enough, that the little Bones and
Muscles of the _Ear-Drum_ do the same Office in straining and relaxing
it, as the Braces of the _War-Drum_ do in that. And considering how
curious and solemn an Apparatus there is of Bones, Muscles, and Joynts,
all adapted to a ready Motion; I am clearly of Dr. _Willis_’s Opinion,
that one great Use of the _Ear-Drum_ is for the proportioning Sounds, and
that by its Extension and Retraction, it corresponds to all Sounds, loud
or languid, as the Pupil of the Eye doth to several Degrees of Light: And
that they are no other than secondary uses assigned by Dr. _Schelhammer_,
as the principal or sole Uses of keeping out the external colder Air,
Dust, and other Annoyances; but especially that, _ob solius aerís interni
potissimùm irrumpentis vim, hunc motum Tympani ac Mallei esse conditum,
ut cedere primùm, deinde sibi restitui queat_; as his Words are, _P.
ult._ c. 6. §. 13.

It was no improbable thought of _Rohault, nos attentos præbere, nil aliud
est, nisi ~Tympanum~, ubi ita opus est facto, contendere aut laxare, &
operam dare ut illud in eâ positione intentum stet, in quâ tremulum aeris
externi motum commodissimè excipere possit._ Roh. Phys. p. 1. c. 26. §.
48.

The Hearing of deaf Persons more easily by Means of loud Noises, is
another Argument of the Use of the Straining or Relaxation of the
_Tympanum_ in Hearing. Thus Dr. _Willis_ (ubi supra) _Accepi olim à viro
fide digno, se mulierem novisse, quæ licèt surda fuerit, quousque tamen
intra conclave Tympanum pulsaretur, verba quævis clarè audiebat: quare
Maritus ejus Tympanistam pro servo domestico conducebat, ut illius ope,
colloquia interdum cum Uxore suâ haberet. Etiam de alio Surdastro mihi
narratum est, qui prope Campanile degens, quoties unà plures Campanæ
resonarent, vocem, quamvis facilè audire, & non aliàs, potuit._

_Abscisso Musculo ~[Processus majoris Mallei]~ in recenti aure, relaxatur
~[Tympani Membrana]~._ _Valsalv. de Aur. Hum._ c. 2. §. 5.

Upon considering the great Difference in Authors Opinions, about the
Use of the Parts, and Manner how Hearing is performed, as also what a
curious Provision there is made in the Ear, by the four little Bones, the
Muscles, Membrane, _&c._ I was minded (since I penned this Note) to make
enquiry my self into this Part, and not to rely upon Authority. And after
a diligent search of various Subjects, I find we may give as rational and
easie an Account of Hearing, as of Seeing, or any other Sense; as I have
shewn in my last cited _Note (d) Book VII. Chap. 2._ with relation to
Birds. And as to Man and Beasts, the Case is the same, but the Apparatus
more complex and magnificent. For whereas in Birds, the _auditory Nerve_
is affected by the Impressions made on the _Membrane_, by only the
Intermediacy of the _Collumella_; in Man, it is done by the Intervention
of the four little Bones, with the Muscles acting upon them; his Hearing
being to be adjusted to all kinds of Sounds, or Impressions made upon
the _Membrana Tympani_. Which Impressions are imparted to the _auditory
Nerve_, in this Manner, _viz._ First they act upon the _Membrane_ and
_Malleus_, the _Malleus_ upon the _Incus_, and the _Incus_ upon the _Os
Orbiculare_ and _Stapes_; and the _Stapes_ upon the _auditory Nerve_:
For the Base of the _Stapes_ (the same as the _Operculum_ in Birds) not
only covers the _Fenestra Ovalis_, within which the _auditory Nerve_
lieth, but hath a Part of the _auditory Nerve_ spread upon it too. It
is manifest that this is the true Process of Hearing; because, if the
_Membrane_ be mov’d, you may see all the Bones move at the same Time, and
work the Base of the _Stapes_ up and down in the _Fenestra Ovalis_, as I
shewed in this Chapter, _Note (d)_ concerning the _Mole_; and as it may
be seen in other Ears carefully opened, if the Parts remain _in situ_.

[w] I do not confine the _Labyrinth_ to the _Canales Semicirculares_,
or any other Part, as the elder Anatomists seem to have done, who by
their erroneous and blind Descriptions seem not well to have understood
there Parts; but with those much more curious and accurate Anatomists,
_Monsieur de Vernay_, and Dr. _Valsalva_; under the _Labyrinth_, I
comprehend the _Canales Semicirculares_, and the _Cochlea_, together with
the intermediate Cavity, called by them the _Vestibulum_.

[x] In the _semicircular Canals_, two Things deserve to be noted. 1.
That the three Canals are of three different Sizes, _Major_, _Minor_,
and _Minimus_. 2. Although in different Subjects, they are frequently
different; yet in the same Subject they are constantly the same. The
Reason of all which, together with their Uses, _Valsalva_ ingeniously
thinks is, that as a Part of the tender _auditory Nerve_ is lodged in
these Canals, so they are of three Sizes, the better to suit all the
Variety of Tones; some of the Canals suiting some, and others, other
Tones. And although there be some Difference as to the Length and Size of
these Canals, in different Persons; yet, lest there should be any discord
in the auditory Organs of one and the same Man, those Canals are always
in exact Conformity to one another in one and the same Man. _V._ _Valsal._
_ubi supr._ c. 3. §. 7. and c. 6. §. 4. 9.

[y] _Hic posterior Nervus extra cranium delatus, in tres ramos dividitur,

[z] _Hujusmodi Nervorum conformatio in Homine usum alium insigniorem
præstas, nempe ut Vox, ~&c.~_ _Willis Ibid._

[aa] Among the Uses to which the Wit of Man hath employ’d Sounds, we
may reckon the Instruments useful in convocating Assemblies, managing
Armies, and many other Occasions, wherein Bells, Trumpets, Drums, Horns,
and other sounding Instruments are used; the Particularities of which
it would be tedious to recount: As that the biggest _Bell_ in _Europe_
is reckoned to be at _Erfurt_ in _Germany_, which they say may be heard
twenty four Miles; with much more to the same Purpose. I shall therefore
only for a Sample take notice of the _Speaking-Trumpet_; the Invention
of which is commonly ascribed to our eminent Sir _Samuel Morland_; but
was more probably _Ath. Kircher_’s; at least he had contrived such an
Instrument, before Sir _Samuel_ hit upon his. _Kircher_ in his _Phonurg._
saith, the _Tromba_ published last Year in _England_, he had invented
twenty four Years before, and published in his _Misurgia_; that _Jac.
Albanus Ghibbesius_, and _Fr. Eschinardus_ ascribe it to him; and that
_G. Schottus_ testifieth he had such an Instrument in his Chamber in the
_Roman College_, with which he could call to, and receive Answers from
the Porter. And considering how famed _Alexander_ the _Great_’s Tube was,
which is said might be heard 100 _Stadia_, it is somewhat strange that
no Body sooner hit upon the Invention. Of this _Stentorophonick Horn_
of _Alexander_, there is a Figure preserved in the _Vatican_, which for
Curiosity sake, I have from _Kircher_ represented in _Fig. 3._ He saith
its Diameter was five Cubits, and that it was suspended on a Supporter.

For the Make of the _Speaking-Trumpet_, and the Reason why it magnifies
Sounds, I shall refer to _Kircher_; especially to Sir _Samuel Morland_’s
_Tuba Stentorophonica_, Published in 1672.

[bb] That the Air is the Subject, or _Medium_ of Sound, is manifest
from the Experiments in rarefied and condensed Air. In an unexhausted
Receiver, a small Bell may be heard at the Distance of some Paces; but
when exhausted, it can scarce be heard at the nearest Distance: And if
the Air be compressed, the Sound will be louder, proportionably to the
Compression or Quantity of Air crouded in, as I have often tried my self,
and may be seen in Mr. _Hawksbee_’s curious Experiments, p. 97. Also his
Experiments in _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 321.

_Kircher_ saith, he took one of these Trumpets of fifteen Palms length,
along with him to the _Mons Eustachianus_, where he convocated 2200
Persons to Prayers, by means of the unusual Sound, at two, three, four,
and five _Italian_ Miles Distance.

With these _Bellowing Trumpets_, I shall join some _Bellowing-Caves_
for the Reader’s Diversion. _Ol. Magnus_ describes a Cave in _Finland_,
near _Viburg_, called _Smellen_, into which, if a Dog, or other Living
Creature be cast, it sends forth so dreadful a Sound, that knocks
down every one near it. For which Reason they have guarded the Cave
with high Walls, to prevent the Mischiefs of its Noise. _Vid._ _Ol.
Magn. Histor._ l. 11. c. 4. Such another _Peter Martyr_ saith is in
_Hispaniola_, which, with a small Weight cast into it, endangers Deafness
at five Miles Distance. And in _Switzerland_, _Kircher_ saith, in the
_Cucumer-Mountain_ is a Pit that sends out both a dreadful Noise and
a great Wind therewith; and that there is a Well in his Country 3000
Palms deep, whose Sound is equal to that of a great Gun. _Vid._ _Kirch.
Phonurg._

_Ol. Magnus_ speaking of the vast high Mountains of a Northern Province,
call’d _Angermannia_ saith, _Ubi bases eorum in profundissimo gurgite
stantes, casu aliquo, vel proposito Nautæ accesserint, tantum horrorem
ex altâ fluctuum collisione percipiunt, ut nisi præcipiti remigio,
aut valido vento evaserint, solo pavore ferè exanimes fiant, multoque
dierum curriculo, ob capitis turbationem, pristinæ mentis, & sanitatis
compotes vix evadant. Habent bases illorum montium in fluctuum ingressu &
regressu tortuosas rimas, sive scissuras, satis stupendo naturæ opificio
fabricatas, in quibus longâ varagine formidabilis ille Sonitus quasi
subterraneum tonitru generatur._ Ol. Magn. l. 2. c. 4. See also _Chap.
12._

Neither doth this succeed only in forced Rarefactions and Condensations
of the Air, but in such also as are natural; as is evident from _David
Frœdlichius_ in _Varenius_, upon the highest Eminencies of _Carpathus_,
near _Kesmarckt_ in _Hungary_. The Story of _Frœdlichius_ is this, _Ego
Mense Junii 1615. tum adolescens, sublimitatem horum montium, cum duobus
comitibus Scholaribus, experiri volens, ubi, cùm in primæ rupis vertice,
magno labore, me summum terminum assecutum esse putarem, demum sese
obtulit alia multo altior cautes, ubi pervasta eaque vacillantia saxa
(quorum unum, si loco à viatore dimovetur——aliquot centena——rapit, &
quidem tanto cum fragore, ut illi metuendum sit nè totus Mons corruat,
eumque obruat) enixus essem, iterum alia sublimior prodiit, ~&c.~ donec
summo vitæ periculo ad supremum cacumen penetraverim. Ex declivioribus
montibus cùm in subjectas valles,——nil nisi obscuram noctem, aut cœruleum
quid, instar profundi aeris, quod vulgò sudum cœlum appellatur, observare
potui, mihique videbar, si de monte caderem, non in terram, sed recte in
solum me prolapsurum. Nimiá enim declivitate, species visibiles extenuatæ
& hebetatæ fuerunt. Cum verò altiorem montem peterem, quasi intra
nebulas densissimas hærebam——Et cùm non procul à summo vertice essem de
sublimi quiescens prospexi & animadverti iis in locis, ubi mihi antea
videbar intra nebulas hæsisse, compactas atque albas sese movere nubes,
supra quas, per aliquot milliaria, & ultra terminos Sepusi commodus
mihi prospectus patuit. Alias tamen etiam nubes altiores, alias item
humiliores, necnon quasdam æqualiter à terrâ distantes vidi. Atque hinc
tria intellexi, 1. Me tum transivisse principium media Aeris regionis. 2.
Distantiam nubium à terrâ, non esse æqualem.——3. Distantiam nubium——non
72 Mill. Ger. ut quidam——sed tantum dimidiatum Mill. Ger. In summum
montis verticem cùm pervenissem, adeò tranquillum & subtilem aërem ibi

Carpathici ad Mill. Germ. à radicibus suis imis exsurgere, & ad supremam
usque aëris regionem, ad quam Venti non ascendunt, pertingere. Explosi
in eâ summitate Sclopetum: quod non majorem sonitum primò præ se tulit,
quàm si ligillum vel bacillum confregissem; post intervallum autem
temporis murmur prolixum invaluit, inferioresque montis partes, convalles
& sylvas opplevit. Descendendo per nives annosas intra convalles, cùm
iterum Sclopetum exonerarem, major & horribilior fragor, quàm ex tormento

The Story being diverting, and containing divers Things remarkable,
I have chosen to note the whole of it (altho’ somewhat long) rather
than single out the Passages only which relate to the diminishing the
Sound of his Pistol, by the Rarity of the Air at that great Ascent into
the Atmosphere; and the magnifying the Sound by the Polyphonisms or
Repercussions of the Rocks, Caverns, and other Phonocamptick Objects
below in the Mount.

But ’tis not the Air alone that is capable of the Impressions of Sound,
but the Water also, as is manifest by striking a Bell under Water, the
Sound of which may plainly enough be heard, but it is much duller, and
not so loud; and it is also a fourth deeper, by the Ear of some great
Judges in Musical Notes, who gave me their Judgments in the matter. But
_Mersenne_ saith, a Sound made under Water, is of the same Tone or Note,
if heard under Water; as are also Sounds made in the Air, when heard
under Water. _Vid._ _Mersen. Hydraul._

Having mentioned the hearing of Sounds under Water, there is another
Curiosity worth mentioning, that also farther proves Water to be
susceptible of the Impressions of Sound, _viz._ _Divers_ at the bottom
of the Sea, can hear the Noises made above, only confusedly. But, on
the contrary, those above cannot hear the Divers below. Of which an
Experiment was made, that had like to have been fatal: One of the Divers
blew an Horn in his Diving-Bell, at the bottom of the Sea; the Sound
whereof (in that compressed Air) was so very loud and irksome, that
stunned the Diver, and made him so giddy, that he had like to have dropt
out of his Bell, and to have been drowned. _Vid._ _Sturmii Colleg. Cur.
Vol. 2. Tentam. 1._

[cc] As to the Distance to which Sound may be sent, having some doubt,
whether there was any Difference between the Northern and Southern Parts,
by the Favour of my learned and illustrious Friend Sir _Henry Newton_,
her Majesty’s late Envoy at _Florence_: I procured some Experiments to be
made for me in _Italy_. His most Serene Highness the _Great Duke_, was
pleased to order great Guns to be fir’d for this purpose at _Florence_,
and Persons were appointed on purpose to observe them at _Leghorne_,
which they compute is no less than 55 Miles in a strait Line. But
notwithstanding the Country between being somewhat hilly and woody, and
the Wind also was not favouring, only very calm and still, yet the Sound
was plainly enough heard. And they tell me, that the _Leghorne_ Guns are
often heard 66 Miles off, at _Porto Ferraio_; that when the _French_
bombarded _Genoa_, they heard it near _Leghorne_, 90 Miles distant: and
in the _Messina Insurrection_, the Guns were heard from thence as far
as _Augusta_ and _Syracuse_, about 100 _Italian_ Miles. These Distances
being so considerable, give me Reason to suspect, that Sounds fly as
far, or nearly as far in the Southern, as in the Northern Parts of the
World, notwithstanding we have a few Instances of Sounds reaching farther
Distances. As Dr. _Hearn_ tells us of Guns fired at _Stockholm_ in 1685,
that were heard 180 _English_ Miles. And in the _Dutch_ War, 1672, the
Guns were heard above 200 Miles. _Vid._ _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 113. Also
there is this farther Reason of Suspicion, that the _Mercury_ in the
_Barometer_ riseth higher without than within the Tropicks, and the more
Northerly, still the higher, which may encrease the Strength of Sounds,
by _Note (bb)._

[dd] As to the Velocity of Sounds, by Reason the most celebrated Authors
differ about it, I made divers nice Experiments my self, with good
Instruments; by which I found, 1. That there is some, although a small
Difference in the Velocity of Sounds, with or against the Wind: which
also is, 2. Augmented or diminished by the Strength or Weakness of
the Wind. But that nothing else doth accelerate or retard it, not the
Differences of Day or Night, Heat or Cold, Summer or Winter, Cloudy or
Clear, Barometer high or low, _&c._ 3. That all kinds of Sounds have the
same Motion, whether they be loud or languid, of Bells, Guns, great or
small, or any other sonorous Body. 4. That they fly equal Spaces in equal
Times. Fifthly and Lastly, That the Mean of their Flight is at the Rate
of a Mile in 9¼ half Seconds, or 1142 Feet in one Second of Time. _Vid._
_Phil. Trans. Ibid._

[ee] _Timothy_ a Musician could excite _Alexander the Great_ to Arms with
the _Phrygian_ Sound, and allay his Fury with another Tone, and excite
him to Merriment. So _Ericus_ King of _Denmark_, by a certain Musician,
could be driven to such a Fury, as to kill some of his best and most
trusty Servants. More of this Power of Musick over the Affections, may
be seen in _Ath. Kirch. Phonurg. L. 2. §. 1._ Also in _Is. Vossius de
Poematum cantu, & Rythmi viribus_.

And not only upon the Affections, but also on the Parts of the Body.
Musick is able to exert its Force, as appears from the _Gascoigne_
Knight, _Cui Phormingis sono audito Vesica statim ad Urinam reddendam
vellicabatur_. Such another we have in Aᵒ. 1. _Ephem. Nat. Curios.
Observ. 134_. Also _Morhoff de Scyph. vitr. per cert. human. vocis
sonum fracto_: where there is not only the Account of the _Dutchman_ at
_Amsterdam_, one _Nich. Peter_, that brake Romer-Glasses with the Sound
of his Voice; but also divers other Instances of the Powers and Effects
of Sound. But to the Story of the _Gascoigne_ Knight, Mr. _Boyl_, from
_Scaliger_, adds a pleasant Passage, That one he had disobliged, to be
even with him, caused at a Feast, a Bag-pipe to be played, when he was
hemmed in with the Company; which made the Knight bepiss himself, to the
great Diversion of the Company, as well as Confusion of himself. _Boyl_’s
_Essay of the Effect of Lang. Motion._ In the same Book are other Matters
that may be noted here. One whose Arm was cut off, was exceedingly
tormented with the discharge of the great Guns at Sea, although he was
at a great Distance on Land. And a great Ship-Commander observed his
wounded Men, with broken Limbs, suffered in like manner at the Enemies
Discharges. An ingenious Domestick of his own would have his Gums bleed
at the tearing of Brown-Paper. And an ingenious Gentleman of Mr. _Boyl_’s
Acquaintance confessed to him, that he was inclined to the _Knight of
Gascoigne_’s Distemper, upon hearing the Noise of a Tap running. The
dancing to certain Tunes, of Persons bit with the _Tarantula_, he was
assured of by an ingenious Acquaintance at _Tarentum_, who saw several,
among the rest a Physician, affected with that Distemper. And many other
Accounts of this kind, seemingly credible, are related in _Morhoff_,
_Kircher_, and many others; although Dr. _Cornelio_ questions the Matters
of Fact relating to the cure of the _Tarantula_-bite, in _Phil. Trans._
Nᵒ. 83. Mr. _Boyl_ also saith, a sober Musician told him, he could make
a certain Woman weep, by playing one Tune, which others would be little
affected at. And he saith, that he himself had a kind of shivering at the
repeating two Verses in _Lucan_. And I add, that I very well know one
to have a sort of chill about his _Præcordia_ and Head, upon reading or
hearing the 53ᵈ Chapter of _Isaiah_; as also _David_’s Lamentations for
_Saul_ and _Jonathan_, 1 Sam. i.

Neither are our own Minds and Bodies only affected with Sounds, but
inanimate Bodies are so also. Of which many Stories may be met with in
_Kircher_, particularly a large Stone that would tremble at the Sound
of one particular Organ-Pipe; in _Morhoff_ also, who among many other
Relations hath this, _Memini cùm ipsi [clarif. Willisio] de experimento
Vitri per vocem fracti narrarem, ex eo audivisse, quod in adibus Musicis
sibi vicinis aliquoties collapsum pavimentum fuerit; quod ipse sonis
continuis adscribere non dubitavit._ Morhoff. cap. 12. _Mersenne_ also,
among many Relations in his _Harmon._ and other Books, tells a far
more probable Story, of a particular Part of a Pavement, that would
shake, as if the Earth would open, when the Organs played, than what he
relates about _Antipathy_, in his _Quæst. Comment. in Genes._ viz. That
the Sound of a Drum made of a Wolf’s Skin, will break another made of
Sheep’s Skin: That Hens will fly at the Sound of an Harp strung with
Fox-Gut-Strings, and more to the same purpose. Mr. _Boyl_ also, in his
last cited Book tells us, Seats will tremble at the Sound of Organs; and
that he hath felt his Hat do so too under his hand, at certain Notes both
of Organs, and in Discourse, that he tried an Arch that would answer to
C fa-ut, and had done so an 100 Years; and that an experienced Builder
told him any well-built Vault will answer some determinate Note. And at
_Eastbury-House_ near _Barking_, I my self discovered the Porch, (having
firm Brick-Walls,) not only to sound when struck on the Bottom, but also
to give almost as loud a Sound, when I sounded the same Note with my
Voice.

_Of the Sense of Smelling._


This Sense I shall dispatch in less Compass than the two last, because
its Apparatus (although sufficiently grand and admirable, yet) is not
so multiplicious as of the Eye and Ear; it being sufficient in this
Sense, that the odoriferous Effluvia of Bodies[a] can have an easy, free
Passage to the olfactory Nerves, without the Formalities of Refractions,
and other Preparations necessary to the Perfection of the two former
Senses. Accordingly the all-wise Creator hath made sufficient Provision
for the Reception of Smells, by the Apertures of the Nostrils[b]; made
not of Flesh, or Bone, but cartilaginous, the better to be kept open,
and withal, to be dilated or contracted, as there is occasion: For which
Service it hath several proper and curious Muscles[c].

And forasmuch as it is by Breathing[d], that the odorant Particles are
drawn in, and convey’d to the Sensory; therefore there is a very wise
Provision made in the _Laminæ_, with which the upper Part of the Nose is
barricaded, which serve to two excellent Uses: Partly, to fence out any
noxious Substances from entering the breathing Passages in our Sleep,
or when we cannot be aware[e]; and partly, to receive the Divarications
of the _olfactory Nerves_, which are here thick spread, and which do by
these Means meet the Smells entring with the Breath, and striking upon
them.

And accordingly, the more accurate this Sense is in any Animal, the
longer we may observe those _Laminæ_ are; and more of them in number
folded up, and crouded together, to contain the more nervous Filaments,
and to detain and fetter the odoriferous Particles in their Windings and
Turnings.

And an admirable Provision this is, which the great Creator hath made
for the good of brute Creatures[f]; the chief Acts of many of whose
Lives, are perform’d by the Ministry of this Sense. In insects, and many
other Creatures, it is of great Use in the Propagation of their Kind;
as particularly in helping them to safe and convenient Places for the
Incubation of their Eggs, and breeding up their Young. Others are by the
Accuracy of this Sense, of Use to Mankind, which would be otherwise of
little or no Use[g]. And most of the irrational Animals, Birds, Beasts,
and creeping Things, do, by their Smell, find out their Food; some at
great Distances, and some at Hand. With what Sagacity do some discover
their Food in the Midst of Mud and Dirt[h]? With what Curiosity do the
herbaceous Kind pick and chuse such Plants as afford them wholsome Food,
or sometimes such as are Medicinal[i], and refute such as would hurt and
destroy them? And all by the Help principally, if not only, of the Smell,
assisted by its near Ally the Taste. Of which I shall in the next Place
speak very briefly.

[c] Had not the Contriver of Animal Bodies been minded that his Work
should have all the Signatures of Accuracy, this Sense might have been
performed with a bare Aperture of the Nose; but that nothing might
go imperfect out of his Hand, he hath made a part of the Nose easily
moveable, and given a Set of Muscles to lift up, and open and shut the
Nostrils; and so adjust it to every Occasion of this Sense.

[e] For a further Guard against the Ingress of noxious Things, the
_Vibrissi_, or Hairs placed at the Entrance of the Nostrils serve, which,
in some measure, stop the Entrance of Things improper, or however give
Warning of them, but at the same Time allow an easy Passage to the Breath
and Odours.

in Hounds) their _Olfactory Nerves_ are not only remarkably large, (like
as they are in other Brutes,) but their Branches and Filaments are, in
the _Laminæ_ of the Nostrils, both more and larger than I have seen in
any other Creature whatsoever. Also there are more Convulsions of the
_Laminæ_ than I ever remember to have found in any other Animal.

_Of the Taste[a]._


In this, as in the last Sense, we have an _Apparatus_ abundantly
sufficient to the Sense; Nerves curiously divaricated about the
Tongue[b], and Mouth, to receive the Impressions of every Gusto; and
these Nerves guarded with a firm and proper Tegument to defend them from
Harms; but withal, so perforated in the papillary Eminences, as to give a
free Admission to Tastes.

But I shall say no more of this Sense; only a Word or two of its Consent
with the Smell, and the Situation of them both: Their Situation is
in the most convenient Place imaginable, for the Discharge of their
Offices; at the first Entrance[c], in the Way to the grand Receptacle
of our Food and Nourishment; to survey what is to be admitted therein;
to judge between what is wholsome, and fit for Nourishment, and what is
unsavoury and pernicious. And for this End, the all-wise Creator seems to
have establish’d a great Consent between the Eye, the Nose, and Tongue,
by ordering the Branches of the same Nerves[d], to each of those three
Parts; as also indeed to divers other Parts of the Body, which I may have
occasion to mention in a more proper Place[e]. By which Means, there is
all the Guard that can be, against pernicious Food; forasmuch as before
it is taken into the Stomach, it is to undergo the Trial of three of
the Senses; the Scrutiny of the Eye, the strict Surveyor of its outward
Appearance; and the Probation of the Smell and Taste, the two severest
Judges of its natural Constitution and Composition.

The Opinions of Anatomists concerning the Organ of _Taste_, are various.
_Bauhin_, _T. Bartholin_, _Bartholette_, _Vestinge_, _Deusinge_, &c.
place it in the laxer, fleshy Parts of the Tongue. Our famous _Wharton_,
in the Gland at the Root of the Tongue: _Laurentius_ in the thin Tunick
covering the Tongue; but the Learned _Malpighi_ with great Probability
concludes, because the outward Cover of the Tongue is perforated, under
which lie papillary Parts, (of which Mr. _Cowper_, hath very good Cuts
in his _Anat. Tab. 13._) that in these the Taste lieth. _Malpighi_’s
Words are, _Quare cùm dictis meatibus insignibus occurrant papillaria
corpora, probabilius est in his ultimo, ex subintranti sapido humore
titillationem, & mordicationem quandam fieri, quæ Gustum efficiat._

_Of the Sense of Feeling[a]._


Having spent so much Time upon the other Senses, and therein given such
ample Proofs of the infinite Creator’s Wisdom; I shall but briefly take
Notice of two Things relating to this last Sense.

One is its Organ, the Nerves. For as all Sensation is performed by the
Nerves[b], and indeed the other Senses (performed by Nerves) are a kind
of Feeling; so is this Sense of _Feeling_ performed by Nerves likewise,
spread in the most incomparable, curious Manner throughout the whole
Body. But to describe their Origine in the Brain, and Spinal-Marrow,
their Ramifications to all the Parts; their Inosculations with one
another; and other Matters; whereby not only the Sense of _Feeling_ is
perform’d, but also animal Motion, and an admirable Consent and Harmony
of all the Parts of the Body is effected: (To describe, I say, these
Things) would take up too much Time, and I have already, and shall, as I
go along, give some Hints thereof.

The other Thing I shall take Notice of, is, the Dispersion of this Sense
throughout the Body, both without, and within. The other Senses, I have
observ’d, are seated in the very best Place for the Relief and Comfort,
the Guard and Benefit of the Animal. And forasmuch as it is necessary to
the Being, and well-being of the Body, that every Part should be sensible
of Things safe, or Things prejudicial to it self; therefore it is an
admirable Contrivance of the great Creator, to disperse this Sense of
_Feeling_ throughout every Part[c]; to distinguish between Pleasure and
Pain; Things salutary, and Things hurtful to the Body.

Thus in the five Senses of Animals, we have an Œconomy worthy of the
Creator, and manifestly demonstrating his Power, Wisdom and Indulgence.
For whether we consider the Mechanism of the Organs, or the great Use
and Convenience of each Sense, we find it noble and grand, curious and
artificial; and every way worthy of its infinite Maker, and beyond the
Wit and Power of any Thing but a GOD: And therefore we must even deny our
Senses, by denying them to be God’s handy-work.

And now from those chief Machines of animal Performances and Enjoyments,
the five Senses; let us pass to another Thing in common to all the
Sensitive Creatures, which is Respiration.

FOOTNOTES:

[a] _Malpighi_ is of this Opinion, that as _Taste_ is performed by the
_Papillæ_ in the Tongue, so is _Feeling_ by such like _Papillæ_ under
the Skin. From several Dissections, and other Observations, he thus
concludes, _Ex his & similibus videbatur animus abundè certior redditus,
earundem Papillarum pyramidalium copiam, quas aliàs in Linguâ descripsi,
in locis præcipuè acquisitiori Tactui dicatis reperiri, eodem progigni

simulque extimam cuticulam. Hæc repetitis sectionibus deprehendi; ex
quibus non improbabiliter deducam, sicuti ex elatioribus——papillis——in

Microscopical Observations. _Vid._ _Cowper’s Anat._ Introd. and Tab. 4.

[b] Although the Eye be the usual Judge of Colours, yet some have been
able to distinguish them by their Feeling. _Quidam fuit qui venit ad M.

CHAP. VII.

_Of Respiration._


Of all the Acts of Animal Life, this is one of the chief, and most
necessary. For whatsoever hath Animal Life, hath also the Faculty of
Respiration, or somewhat equivalent thereto[a]. Indeed so congenial
is this with Life, that _Breath_ and _Life_ are in Scripture Phrase
and Common Speech taken as synonymous Things, or at least necessary
Concomitants of one another. _Moses_[b] expresseth animal Life, by [_The
Breath of Life_]. Saith he, _Gen._ vii. 21, 22. _All Flesh that moved on
the Earth, Fowl, Cattle, Beast, creeping Things, and Man; all in whose
Nostrils was the Breath of Life in the dry Land died._ So the Psalmist,
_Psal._ civ. 29. _Thou takest away their Breath, they die._ So grand an
Act therefore in common to all Animals, may justly deserve a Place in
this Survey of the Works of God in the animal Kingdom.

And here I might launch out into an ample Description of all the Parts
ministering to this necessary Act, and shew the curious Contrivance and
artificial Structure of them; but a transient View shall suffice. I
might begin with the outward Guards, the Nose and Mouth; but these have
been already touched upon. But the exquisite Mechanism of the _Larynx_,
its Variety of Muscles, its Cartilages, all so exquisitely made for the
Purpose of Respiration, and forming the Voice[c], are very admirable:
And no less so is the Tongue[d], which ministers to that, and many other
Uses too.

Next, the Fabrick of the[e] _Trachea_ deserves especial Remark. Its
Valve, the _Epiglottis_ on the Top, to fence against all Annoyances;
its cartilaginous Rings[f] nearly environing it, with its membranous
Part next the Gullet, to give the freer Passage to the Descent of the
Food. And Lastly, Its inner Tegument of exquisite Sense to be readily
affected with, and to make Efforts against every Thing that is hurtful or
offensive; these, I say, do all justly deserve our Admiration.

And no less prodigious are the Parts farther within; the _Bronchi_, the
_Vesiculæ_[g], with their muscular Fibres[h], as some assert they have,
together with the Arteries and Veins, which every where accompany the
airy Passages, for the Blood to receive there its Impregnations from the
Air.

From hence I might proceed to the commodious Form of the Ribs[i], the
curious Mechanism of the Intercostal-Muscles[k], the Diaphragm, and all
the other Muscles[l] ministring both to the ordinary, and extraordinary
Offices of Respiration. But passing them by, I shall stop at one
prodigious Work of Nature, and manifest Contrivance of the Almighty
Creator, which although taken notice of by others[m], yet cannot be
easily passed by in the Subject I am upon; and that is the Circulation
of the Blood in the _Fœtus in the Womb_, so different from the Method
thereof after it is Born. In the Womb, whilst it is as one Body with the
Mother, and there is no Occasion, nor Place for Respiration, there are
two Passages[n] on purpose for the Transmission of the Blood without
passing it through the Lungs. But as soon as the _Fœtus_ is Born, and
become thereby a perfectly distinct Being, and breathes for it self, then
these two Passages are shut up: one nearly obliterated, the other becomes
only a Ligament, except in some Creatures that are Amphibious, or are
forced to lie long under Water, in whom these Passages probably remain
open[o].

And now what Action of any rational Creature, what is there in a Man’s
Life, that doth more plainly shew Design, Reason, and Contrivance, than
this very Act of Nature doth the Contrivance and Design of the great GOD
of Nature? What is Thought and Contrivance, if this be not? Namely, That
there should be a temporary Part in the Body, made just for the present
Exigence; to continue whilst there is occasion for it, and to cease when
there is none; in some Creatures to remain always, by Reason of their
amphibious Way of Living, and in Land-animals (purely such) to cease?

Another excellent Contrivance, a-kin to the last, is, for the
Preservation of such Creatures whose occasions frequently necessitate
them to live without, or with but little Respiration: Fishes might
be named here, whose Habitation is always in the Waters; but these
belong to an Element which I cannot at present engage in. But there
are many Animals of our own Element, or partly so, whose Organs of
Respiration, whose Blood, whose Heart, and other Instruments of Life, are
admirably accommodated to their Method of Living: Thus many amphibious
Creatures[p], who live in Water as well as Air; many quadrupeds, Birds,
Insects, and other Animals, who can live some Hours, Days, yea, whole
Winters, with little or no Respiration, in a Torpitude, or sort of Sleep,
or middle State between Life and Death: The Provision made for these
peculiar Occasions of Life, in the Fabrick of the Lungs, the Heart, and
other Parts of such Creatures[q], is manifestly the Work of him, who as
St. _Paul_ saith[r], _giveth to all Breath, and Life, and all Things_.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] The Uses assign’d to _Respiration_ by all the Anatomists before
_Malpighi_’s Discoveries of the Structure of the Lungs, are so various,
and many of them so improbable, that it would be frivolous to recount
them. But the more eminent modern Anatomists assign these Uses. _Willis_
thus sums up his Opinion, _Præcipua Pulmonum functio, & usus sunt,
sanguinem & aerem per totas partium compages, intimosque recessus, atq;
ductus quosque minutissimos traducere, & ubique invicem committere; in
cum nempe finem, ut sanguis venosus à circuitu redux, & chymo recenti
dilutus,——tum perfectiùs misceatur & velut subigatur, tum potissimùm
ut secundùm omnes suas partes ab aëre nitroso de novo accendatur._
Pharmaceut. p. 2. S. 1. c. 2. §. 2. _Mayow_ saith rightly, that one grand
Use of _Expiration_ is, _Ut cum aëre expulso, etiam vapores è sanguine
exhalantes, simul exsufflentur._ And as for _Inspiration_, that it
coveyeth a nitro-aerial ferment to the Blood, to which the Animal-Spirits
are owing, and all Muscular-Motion. _Mayow de Respir._ p. 22. _&c._ _meâ
Edit_.

Somewhat of the Opinion of these two last cited, if I mistake not (it
being long since I read their Tracts, and have them not now at hand,)
were _Ent_, _Sylvius_, _Swammerdam_, _Diemerbroek_, and my Friend Mr.
_Ray_ in an unpublished Tract of his, and in his Letters now in my Hands.

But our Dr. _Thurston_, for good Reasons, rejects these from being
principal Uses of Respiration, and thinks, with great Reason, the
principal Uses to be to move, or pass the Blood from the right to
the left Ventricle of the Heart. Upon which account Persons hanged,
drowned, or strangled by Catarrhs, so suddenly die, namely, because
the Circulation of their Blood is stopped. For the same Reason also it
is, that Animals die so soon in the Air-Pump. Among other Proofs he
instanceth in an Experiment of Dr. _Croon_, _Profess. Gresh._ which he
made before our _R. S._ by strangling a Pullet, so that not the least
Sign of Life appear’d; but by blowing Wind into the Lungs through the
_Trachea_, and so setting the Lungs a playing, he brought the Bird to
Life again. Another Experiment was once tried by Dr. _Walter Needham_,
before Mr. _Boyl_, and others at _Oxford_, by hanging a Dog, so that
the Heart ceased moving. But hastily opening the Dog, and blowing Wind
into the _Ductus Pecquetianus_, he put the Blood in Motion, and by that
means the Heart, and so recovered the Dog to Life again. _V._ _Thurston
de Respir. Us._ p. 60, and 63. _meâ Edit_.

Such an Experiment as Dr. _Croon_’s my Friend, the late justly renowned
Dr. _Hook_ shewed also our _R. S._ He cut away the _Ribs_, _Diaphragm_,
and _Pericardium_, of a Dog; also the top of the Wind-Pipe, that he might
tie it on to the Nose of a Pair of Bellows; and by blowing into the
Lungs, he restored the Dog to Life; and then ceasing blowing, the Dog
would soon fall into dying Fits; but by blowing again, he recovered; and
so alternately would die, and recover, for a considerable Time, as long,
and often as they pleased. _Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ. 28.

For the farther Confirmation of Dr. _Thurston_’s Opinion, the ingenious
Dr. _Musgrave_ cut off, and close stopped up the Wind-Pipe of a Dog
with a Cork, and then threw open the _Thorax_; where he found the Blood
stagnating in the _Lungs_, the _Arteria Pulmonaris_ the _right Ventricle_
and _Auricle_ of the _Heart_, and the two great Trunks of the _Cava_,
distended with Blood to an immense Degree; but at the same Time, the
_Vena Pulmonaris_, the _left Ventricle_ and _Auricle_ of the _Heart_ in
a manner empty, hardly a spoonful of Blood therein. _Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ.
240. Or both the Experiments may be together met with in _Lowth. Abridg.
Vol. 3. p. 66, 67._

This Opinion of our learned _Thurston_, the late learned _Etmullerus_
espoused, who being particular in reckoning up the Uses of Respiration,
I shall therefore the more largely cite him. Respiration, saith
he, serves, _1. Ad Olfactum. 2. Ad Screatum & Sputationem. 3. Ad
Oscitationem, Tussim, Sternutationem, Emunctionemque. 4. Ad liquidorum
Sorbitionem, Suctionemve. 5. Ad Loquelam, Cantum, Clamorem, Risum,
Fletum, Flatum, ~&c.~ 6. Ad facum Alvi, Urinæ, Fœtûs Molæve, necnon
Secundinarum expulsionem. 7. Ad promovendi Ventriculi, Intestinorum,
Lacteorumque vasorum, ~&c.~ contenta. 8. Ad halitus aqueos Sanguinis è
pulmonibus, aëris ope, exportandos. 9. Ad Diapnoën. 10. Ad exactiorem
Chyli, Lymphaque, necnon Sanguinis——miscelam. 11. Ad conciliandum
sanguini——coccineam rubedinem, ~&c.~ 12. Nec merosè negabimus,
aërem——pulmones, & sanguinem illos transcurrentem, minùs calida reddere,
~&c.~ 13. Quod denique aër sanguini singulis Respirationibus aliquantillâ
sui parte, admixtus, paucissimas quasdam in spiritum animalium
elaboratione particulas simul contribuat._ All these Uses, although of
great Consequence, yet he thinks rather conduce to the _Well-Being_, than
the Being of the Animal; because without any of them, the Animal would
not so speedily die, as it doth by Strangling, or in the Air-Pump. He
therefore assigns a 14ᵗʰ, and the principal Use of Respiration to be,
_For the passing of the Blood through the Lungs, that is thrown into them
by the Heart._ Etmull. Dissert. 2. c. 10. §. 1. & 16.

But the late Dr. _Drake_, with great Ingenuity and Address, (like a
Person so considerable for his Years, as he was in his Time,) not only
establish’d this Notion of Respiration, but also carries it farther,
making it the true Cause of the _Diastole_ of the Heart; which neither
_Borelli_, _Lower_, or _Cowper_, much less any before those great Men,
have well accounted for. That the Heart is a Muscle, is made evident
beyond all doubt by Dr. _Lower_. And that the Motion of all Muscles
consists in Constriction, is not to be doubted also. By which means the
_Systole_ is easily accounted for. But forasmuch as the Heart hath no
_Antagonist-Muscle_, the _Diastole_ hath puzzled the greatest Wits. But
Dr. _Drake_ with great Judgment, and much Probability of Reason, maketh
the Weight of the Incumbent Atmosphere to be the true _Antagonist_
to all the Muscles which serve both for ordinary Inspiration and the
Constriction of the Heart. The Particulars of his Opinion may be seen in
his _Anatomy_, l. 2. c. 7. And in _Philos. Trans. 281._

And I remember when I was at the University, my most ingenious and
learned Tutor Dr. _Wills_, when he read Anatomy to us, was of Opinion,
that the Lungs were blown up by the Weight of the incumbent Air, and
represented the manner of Respiration in this manner, _viz._ He put a
Bladder into a Pair of Bellows, turning back the Neck of the Bladder,
and tying it fast, so that no Air might enter in between the Bladder
and Bellows. This being done, when the Bellows were opened, the Bladder
would be blown up by the Weight of the incumbent Air; and when shut,
the Air would be thereby pressed forcibly out of the Bladder, so as to
blow the Fire. This Experiment I take Notice of here; because (besides
the Illustration it gives to Respiration) that great _Genius_ seems to
have had a truer Notion of this _Phænomenon_, than was very common then,
_viz._ about the Year 1677 or 78; as also, because I have in some Authors
met with the same Experiment, without mention of Dr. _Wills_, whose I
take it to have been.

Another Use of great Consideration, the already commended Dr. _Cheyne_
assigns; namely, to form the elastick Globules of which the Blood
principally consists, without which there would be a general Obstruction
in all the capillary Arteries. _Cheyne_’s _Phil. Prin. of Nat. Rel._ or
_Harris_’s _Lex. Tech. in Lungs._

[b] _Gen._ ii. 7. vi. 17. _and_ vii. 15.

[c] Because it would be endless to specify the curious Mechanism of all
the Parts, concurring to the Formation of the Voice; I shall therefore
for a Sample note only two Things, 1. There are thirteen Muscles provided
for the Motion of the five Cartilages of the _Larynx_, _Gibs. Anat. l. 2.
c. 14_, a Sign of the careful and elaborate Provision that is made for
the Voice. 2. It is a prodigious Faculty of the _Glottis_, in contracting
and dilating itself with such Exquisiteness, as to form all Notes. For
(as the ingenious Dr. _Keil_ saith) _supposing the greatest Distance
of the two Sides of the ~Glottis~, to be one tenth Part of an Inch in
sounding 12 Notes, (to which the Voice easily reaches;) this Line must
be divided into 12 Parts, each of which gives the Aperture requisite for
such a Note, with a certain Strength. But if we consider the Sub-division
of Notes, into which the Voice can run, the Motion of the Sides of the
~Glottis~ is still vastly nicer. For if two Chords sounding exactly
Unisons, one be shortened, ⅟₂₀₀₀ Part of its Length, a just Ear will
perceive the Disagreement, and a good Voice will sound the Difference,
which is ⅟₁₉₆ Part of a Note. But suppose the Voice can divide a Note
into 100 Parts, it follows that the different Apertures of the ~Glottis~
actually divide the tenth Part of an Inch into 1200 Parts, the Effect
of each of which produces a sensible Alteration upon a good Ear. But
because each Side of the ~Glottis~ moves just equally, therefore the
Divisions are just double, or the Sides of the ~Glottis~, by their Motion
do actually divide one tenth Part of an Inch into 2400 Parts._ _Keil_’s
Anat. c. 3. Sect. 7.

[d] Among the Instruments of Speech, the Tongue is a necessary one; and
so necessary, that it is generally thought no Speech can be without it.
But in the third Tome of the _Ephem. Germ._ is published, _Jac. Rolandi
Aglossostomographia, sive Descriptio Oris sine Linguâ, quod perfecte
loquitur, & reliquas suas functiones naturalitèr exercet._ The Person
described is one _Pet. Durand_, a _French_ Boy of eight or nine Years
old, who at five or six lost his Tongue by a _Gangrene_, occasioned the
Small-Pox. Notwithstanding which, he could (as the Title saith) speak
perfectly, as also taste, spit, swallow, and chew his Food; but this
latter he could do only on that Side he put it into, not being able to
turn it to the other Side his Mouth.

In the same Tract, _Chap. 6._ is this Observation of _ventriloquous_
Persons, _Memini me à quodam sat celebri Anatomico audivisse, dum de
duplicaturâ Mediastini ageret, si Membrana ista duplex naturalitèr
unita in duas partes dividatur, loquelam quasi ex pectore procedere, ut
circumstantes credant Dæmoniacum hunc, aut Sternomythum._

[e] _The Variation of the Wind-pipe is observable in every Creature,
according as it is necessary for that of the Voice. In an ~Urchin~, which
hath a very small Voice, ’tis hardly more than membranous. And in a
~Pigeon~, which hath a low and soft Note, ’tis partly cartilaginous, and
partly membranous. In an ~Owl~, which hath a good audible Note, ’tis
more cartilaginous; but that of a ~Jay~, hath hard Bones instead of
Cartilages; and so of a ~Linnet~: Whereby they have both of them a louder
and stronger Note, ~&c.~_

_The Rings of the Wind-pipe are fitted for the Modulation of the Voice:
For in ~Dogs~ and ~Cats~, which in the Expression of divers Passions use
a great many Notes, (as Men do,) they are open and flexible, as in Man.
Whereby all, or any of them are dilated, or contracted, more or less, as
is convenient for a higher or deeper Note, ~&c.~ whereas in some other
Animals, as in the ~Japan-Peacock~, which useth hardly more than one
single Note, they are entire, ~&c.~_ _Grew_’s Cosmolog. Sacr. _Book I.
Chap. 5. §. 9, 10._

[f] It is a farther manifest Indication of singular Design in the
cartilaginous Rings of the _aspera Arteria_, that all the Way where they
are contiguous to the _Oesophagus_, they are membranous, to afford an
easie Passage to the Food; but after that, in the _Bronchi_; they are,
some compleatly annular, some triangular, _&c._ And another observable
is, the lower Parts of the superior Cartilages, receive the upper Parts
of the inferior, in the _Bronchi_; whereas in the _aspera Arteria_, the
Cartilages run and remain parallel to one another; which is a noble
Difference or Mechanism in this (in a Manner) one and the same Part,
enabling the Lungs and _Bronchi_ to contract themselves in Expiration,
and to extend and dilate themselves in Inspiration.

[g] I shall not here intrench so much upon the Anatomist’s Province, to
give a Description of the _Lungs_, although it be a curious Piece of
God’s Workmanship; but refer to Seignior _Malpighi_, the first Discoverer
of their _Vesiculæ_ in 1660, in his two Letters to _Borelli de Pulmon_.
Also to Dr. _Willis_’s _Pharm. Rat._ p. 2. S. 1. c. 1. _de Respir.
Orig. & Us._ who as he wrote after _Malpighi_, so hath more accurately
described those parts; and to Mr. _Cowper_’s _Anat._ Tab. 24, 25. And
if the Reader hath a Mind to see what Opposition Seignior _Malpighi_’s
Discoveries met with at Home and Abroad, and what Controversies he had
on that Account, as also his Censures of Dr. _Willis_’s Descriptions and
Figures, he may consult _Malpighi_’s Life written by himself, _pag. 4 to
21_.

That the _Lungs_ consist of _Vesiculæ_, or _Lobuli_ of _Vesiculæ_
admitting of Air from the _Bronchi_, is visible, because they may be
blown up, cleansed of Blood, and so dried. But Mr. _Cowper_ saith, he
could never part the _Lobuli_, (so as to make Dr. _Willis_’s _Fig.
1. Tab. 3. & 4._) so that probably the _Vesiculæ_ are contiguous to
one another throughout each Lobe of the Lungs. And not only Air; but
_Diemerbroeck_ proves, that the _Vesiculæ_ admit of Dust also, from two
asthmatick Persons he opened; one a Stonecutter’s Man, the _Vesiculæ_ of
whose Lungs were so stuffed with Dust, that in cutting, his Knife went as
if through an Heap of Sand; the other was a Feather-driver, who had these
Bladders filled with the fine Dust or Down of Feathers.

[h] There is a considerable Difference between Dr. _Willis_, and
_Etmuller_, _viz._ Whether the _Vesiculæ_ of the Lungs have any muscular
Fibres or not? _Etmuller_ expressly saith, _Nullas Fibras musculosas,
multo minùs rubicundam Musculorum compagem (sunt enim Vesiculæ albidæ &
fere diaphanæ) in ipsis reperiri._ ubi supr. c. 6. §. 2. And afterwards,
§. 3. _Pulmones esse molles flexilesque musculosis fibris ceu propriæ
explicationis organis destitutos._ But Dr. _Willis_ as expressly alerts
they have musculous Fibres, and assigns an excellent Use of them;
_Cellulæ istæ vesiculares, ut nixus pro expiratione contractivos edant,
etiam fibras, utì per Microscopium planè conspicere est, musculares
obtinent_, ubi supr. §. 16. And in the next §, _Ut pro datâ occasione
majorem aëris copiam exsufflent, aut materiam extussiendam ejiciant,
fibris muscularibus donatæ, sese arctiùs contrahunt, contentaque sua
penitùs exterminant. Et enim ordinariæ pectoris Systolæ, quas musculorum
relaxationes ex parte efficiunt, aërem forsan totum à Tracheâ &
Bronchiis, haud tamen à Vesiculis, quâque vice ejiciunt: propter has
(quoties opus erit) inaniendas, & totius Pectoris cavitas plurimùm
angustatur, & cellulæ ipsæ vesiculures à propriis fibris constrictis
coarctantur._

[i] _Circa hos motus [Scil. Pectoris dilatationem, &c.] divini Conditoris
mechanicen, ad regulas Mathematicas planè adaptaram, satis admirari non
possumus; siquidem nullâ aliâ in re manifestùs Ὁ Θεὸς γεωμετρεῖν videtur.
Quippe cùm pectoris, tum ampliato, tum coarctatio à quibusdam Musculis
(quorum munus unicum est contrahere) perfici debeat; res ita instituitur,
ut Costæ quæ thoracis, volut parallelogrammi oblongi versus cylindrum
incurvati, latera efformant, in figuram modò quadratam, cum angulis
rectis, pro pectoris ampliatione; modò in rhomboeidem, cum angulis acutis
pro ejusdem contractione, ducantur, ~&c.~_ Willis, _ubi supr._ §. 28.

_Galen_ having spoken of the Parts ministring to Respiration, concludeth,
_Nihil usquam à Naturâ ullo pacto per incuriam, fuisse præteritum,
qua cùm omnia præsentiret & provideret, quæ sunt necessaria illa, quæ
causa alicujus extiterunt, confecutura, omnibus instaurationes parare
occupavit, cujus apparatus copiosa facultas admirabilem Sapientiam
testantur._ De us. part. l. 5. c. 15. See also _l. 6. c. 1._

[k] For the Structure of the _Intercostals_, _Midriff_, &c. I shall
refer to Dr. _Willis_, and other Anatomists. Bur Dr. _Drake_ taxeth Dr.
_Willis_ with an Error in fancying there is an Opposition in the Office
of the _Intercostals_, by reason that the Fibres of the _external_ and
_internal Intercostals_ decussate; that therefore the _external_ serve
to raise the Ribs, the _internal_ to draw them down. But Dr. _Drake_
is of _Steno_’s, and Dr. _Mayow_’s Opinion, that notwithstanding the
Decussation of their Fibres, the Power they exert upon, and the Motion
they effect in the Ribs, is one and the same. _Drake_’s _Anat._ l. 2. c.
7. and l. 4. c. 5. _Mayow de Respir._ c. 7.

[l] Although Dr. _Drake_ and some others deny the _Intercostals_ being
Antagonist-Muscles, as in the preceding Note, yet they, and most other
Anatomists that I have met with, attribute a considerable Power to them
in the act of Respiration, as they do also to the _Subclavian_ and
_Triangular Muscles_: but the learned _Etmuller_ denies it for these
three Reasons, _1. Quia respirando nullam in illis contractionem sentio.
2. Quia——sibi invicem non adducuntur, ~&c.~ 3. Quia Costæ omnes ab aliis
modò enarratis musculis moventur, idque simul, ~&c.~ Intercostales
itaque, necnon Subclavios Musculos Costis, parietum instar, ad complenda
interstitia intercostalia, pectusque integrandum, ac Costas connectendas,
intertectos esse, probabiliter concludo; quo munere triangulares
etiam——fungi, rationi consentaneum est._ Etmul. Dissert. 2. cap. 4. §. 6.

But as to the Use of the _Triangular Muscle_ in Respiration, we may
judge of it, from its remarkable Size, and Use in a Dog; of which Dr.
_Willis_ gives this Account from _Fallopius_: _In Homine parvus adeò &
subtilis iste ~[Musculus]~ est, ut vix pro Musculo accipi queat: in Cane
per totum os pectoris protenditur, & cartilagines omnes, etiam verarum
Costarum sterno inosculatas, occupat: Cujus discriminis ratio divinam
circa Animalium fabricas Providentiam planè indigitat. Quippe cùm hoc
animal, ad cursus velocissimos & diu continuandos natum, quo sanguis, dum
intensiùs agitatur, ritè accendatur eventileturque, aërem celerrimè &
fortiter uti inspirare, ita etiam exspirare debet——idcirco propter hunc
actum firmiùs obeundum (cujus in Homine haud magnus est usus) musculus
caninas molem ingentem & tanto operi parem fortitur._ Willis _ubi supr._
§. 32.

[m] _Ray_’s Wisdom of God in the Creation, p. 343.

[n] Mr. _Cheselden_, an ingenious and most accurate Anatomist, having
somewhat particular in his Observations about the Circulation of the
Blood through the Heart of the _Fœtus_, I shall present the Reader with
some of his Observations, which he favoured me with the Sight of. _The
Blood_ (saith he) _which is brought to the Heart by the ascending Cava,
passes out of the right Auricle into the left, through a Passage called
~Foramen Ovale~, in the ~Septum~ ~[common to them both]~ without passing
through the right Ventricle (as after the Birth) while the Blood from
the descending Cava passeth through the right Auricle and Ventricle into
the pulmonary Artery, and thence into the ~Aorta~ through the Duct,
betwixt that and the pulmonary Artery, called ~Ductus Arteriosus~, whilst
a small Portion of the Blood, thrown into the pulmonary Artery passeth
through the Lungs, no more than is sufficient to keep open the pulmonary
Vessels. Thus both Ventricles are employed in driving the Blood through
the ~Aorta~ to all Parts of the ~Fœtus~, and to the Mother too. But after
the Birth, the Blood being to be driven from the ~Aorta~ through the
~Fœtus~ alone, and not the Mother too, one Ventricle becomes sufficient,
whilst the other is employed in driving the Blood through the Lungs,
the ~Ductus Arteriosus~ being shut up by means of the Alteration of its
Position, which happens to it from the raising the ~Aorta~ by the Lungs
when they become inflated. After that the Blood is thus driven into the
Lungs, in its return it shuts the ~Valve~ of the ~Foramen Ovale~ against
the ~Foramen~ it self, to whose Sides it soon adheres, and so stops up
the Passage. The ~Ductus Arteriosus~, or ~Ductus Arteriosus in Ligamentum
versus~, is seldom to be discerned in adult Bodies, but the Figure of the
Foramen ~Ovale~ is never obliterated._

[o] It hath been generally thought to be not improbable, but that on some
Occasions the _Foramen Ovale_ may remain open in Man. In a Girl of four
or five Years of Age, Dr. _Connor_ found it but half closed, and in the
Form of a Crescent. And he thinks somewhat of this kind might be in the
Person whose Skeleton was found to have no Joynts in the Back-Bone, Ribs,
_&c._ Of which a Description, with Cuts, may be found in _Phil. Trans._
Nᵒ. 215. and more largely in his _Dissert. Med. Phys. de stupendo Ossium
coalitu_, where he adds to the Girl, in whom the _For. Ov._ was not shut,
a like Observation of another Girl he opened at _Oxford_ of three Years
Old, _In quâ Foramen Ovals ferè erat occlusum, in medio tamen, exili
foramine, per quod Turundam facilè transmisi, erat pervium_, pag. 30. So
Mr. _Cowper_ (than whom none more accurate and a better Judge) saith, _I
have often found the ~Foramen Ovale~ open in the Adult._ Anat. Append.
Fig. 3. But Mr. _Cheselden_ is of a different Opinion. Of which in the
following Note.

From somewhat of this Cause I am apt to think it was that the
_Tronningholm Gardiner_ escaped drowning, and some others mentioned
by _Pechlin_. His Stories are, _Hortulanus Tronningholmensis etiamnum
vivens, annos natos 65, pro illâ ætate satis adhuc valens & vegetus, cùm
ante 18 annos, alii in aquas delapso opem ferre vellet, forte fortunâ &

Shall we to this Cause, or to the Ossification, or more than ordinary
Strength of the Wind-Pipe, attribute the Recovery to Life of Persons
hanged? Of which _Pechlin_ gives an Instance that fell under his own
Knowledge, of a Woman hanged, and in all Appearance dead, but recovered
by a Physician accidentally coming in, with a plentiful Administration
of _Spir. Sal. Armon. Pechl. ib._ c. 7. And the Story of _Anne Green_,
executed at _Oxford_, _Dec. 14. 1650._ is still well remembered among the
Seniors there. _She was hanged by the Neck near half an Hour, some of
her Friends in the mean Time thumping her on the Breast, others hanging
with all their Weight upon her Legs, sometimes lifting her up, and then
pulling her down again with a sudden Jirk, thereby the sooner to dispatch
her out of her Pain_: as her printed Account wordeth it. After she was in
her Coffin, being observed to breath, a lusty Fellow stamped with all his
Force on her Breast and Stomach, to put her out of her Pain. But by the
assistance of Dr _Peity_, Dr. _Willis_, Dr. _Bathurst_, and Dr. _Clark_,
she was again brought to Life. I my self saw her many Years after, after
that she had (I heard) born divers Children. The Particulars of her
Crime, Execution and Restauration, see in a little Pamphlet, called _News
from the Dead_, written, as I have been informed, by Dr. _Bathurst_,
(afterwards the most vigilant and learned President of _Trinity-College,
Oxon_,) and published in 1651. with Verses upon the Occasion.

[p] The Sea-Calf hath the _Foramen Ovale_, by which means it is enabled
to stay long under the Water, as the _Paris. Anatomists_. Of which see in
_Book VI. Chap. 5. Note (c)._

But the fore-commended Mr. _Cheselden_ thinks the _Foramen Ovale_ is
neither open in amphibious Creatures, nor any adult Land-Animals. _When
I first_ (saith he) _applied my self to the Dissection of Human Bodies,
I had no distrust of the frequent Accounts of the ~Foramen Ovale~ being
open in Adults: but I find since, that I mistook the ~Ostium Venarum
Coronariarum~ for the ~Foramen~. The like I suppose Authors have done,
who assert that it is always open in amphibious Animals: for we have made
diligent Enquiry into those Animals, and never found it open. Neither
would that (as they imagine) serve these Creatures to live under Water,
as the ~Fœtus~ doth in ~Utero~, unless the ~Ductus Arteriosus~ was open
also._

This Opinion of Mr. _Cheselden_ hath this to render it probable, that
the _Ostium Venarum Coronariarum_ is so near the _Foramen Ovale_, that
without due regard, it may be easily mistaken for it. Such therefore as
have Opportunity of examining this Part in amphibious Animals, or any
other Subject, ought to seek for the _Ostium_, whenever they suspect they
have met with the _Foramen_.

CHAP. VIII.

_Of the Motion of Animals._


Next to the two grand Acts of animal Life, their Sense or Respiration,
I shall consider their _Motion_, or _locomotive Faculty_; whereby they
convey themselves from Place to Place, according to their Occasions,
and Way of Life: And the admirable Apparatus to this Purpose, is a
plain Demonstration of God’s particular Foresight, Care, and especial
Providence towards all the animal World.

And here I might view in the first Place the Muscles, their curious
Structure[a], the nice tacking them to every Joynt, to pull it this
Way, and that Way, and the other Way, according to the special Purpose,
Design, and Office of every such Joint: Also their various Size and
Strength; some large and corpulent, others less, and some scarce visible
to the naked Eye; all exactly fitted to every Place, and every use of
the Body. And lastly, I might take Notice of the muscular Motions, both
involuntary and spontaneous[b].

Next, I might survey the special Fabrick of the Bones[c], ministring
to animal Motion. Next, I might take notice of the Joynts[d], their
compleat Form adjusted to the Place, and Office they are employed in;
their Bandage, keeping them from Luxations; the oily Matter[e] to
lubricate them, and their own Smoothness to facilitate their Motion.

And lastly, I might trace the various Nerves throughout the Body;
sent about to minister to its various Motions[f]. I might consider
their Origine[g], their Ramifications to the several Parts, and their
Inosculations with one another, according to the Harmony and Accord of
one Part with another, necessary for the Benefit of the Animal. But some
of those Things I have given some Touches upon already, and more I shall
mention hereafter[h], and it would be tedious here to insist upon them
all.

I shall therefore only speak distinctly to the Locomotive Act it self, or
what directly relates to it.

And here it is admirable to consider the various Methods of Nature[i],
suited to the Occasions of various Animals. In some their Motion is
swift, in others slow. In some performed with two, four, or more Legs: in
some with two, or four Wings: in some with neither[k].

And first for swift or slow Motion. This we find is proportional to the
Occasions of each respective Animal. _Reptiles_, whose Food, Habitation,
and Nests, lie in the next Clod, Plant, Tree, or Hole, or can bear
long Hunger and Hardship, they need neither Legs nor Wings for their
Transportation; but their vermicular or sinuous Motion (performed with
no less Art, and as curiously provided for as the Legs or Wings of other
Creatures: This, I say,) is sufficient for their Conveyance.

_Man_ and _Beasts_, whose Occasions require a large Room, have
accordingly a swifter Motion, with proper Engines for that Service;
answerable to their Range for Food, their Occupation of Business, or
their want of Armature, and to secure them against Harms[l].

But for the winged Creatures (Birds and Insects,) as they are to traverse
large Tracts of Land and Water, for their Food, for their commodious
Habitation, or Breeding their Young, to find Places of Retreat and
Security from Mischiefs; so they have accordingly the Faculty of flying
in the Air; and that swiftly or slowly, a long or short a Time, according
to their Occasions and Way of Life. And accordingly their Wings, and
whole Body, are curiously prepared for such a Motion; as I intend to shew
in a proper Place[m].

Another remarkable Thing in the motive Faculty of all Creatures, is the
neat, geometrical Performance of it. The most accurate Mathematician, the
most skilful in mechanick Motions, can’t prescribe a nicer Motion (than
what they perform) to the Legs and Wings of those that walk or fly[n],
or to the Bodies of those that creep[o]. Neither can the Body be more
compleatly poised for the Motion it is to have in every Creature, than
it already actually is. From the largest Elephant, to the smallest Mite,
we find the Body artfully balanced[p]. The Head not too heavy, nor too
light for the rest of the Body, nor the rest of the Body for it[q]. The
_Viscera_ are not let loose, or so placed, as to swag, over-balance,
or over-set the Body; but well-braced, and distributed to maintain the
æquipoise of the Body. The motive Parts also are admirably well fixed
in respect to the Center of Gravity; placed in the very Point, fittest
to support and convey the Body. Every Leg beareth his true Share of the
Body’s Weight. And the Wings so nicely are set to the Center of Gravity,
as even in that fluid _Medium_, the Air, the Body is as truly balanced,
as we could have balanced it with the nicest Scales.

But among all Creatures, none more elegant than the sizing the Body of
_Man_, the gauging his Body so nicely, as to be able to stand erect, to
stoop, to sit, and indeed to move any way, only with the Help of so small
a Stay as the Feet[r]: whose Mechanism of Bones, Tendons and Muscles to
this purpose, is very curious and admirable.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] That the Muscles are compounded of Fibres, is visible enough. Which
Fibres, the curious and ingenious _Borelli_ saith, are cylindraceous; not
hollow, but filled with a spungy, pithy Substance, after the manner of
Elder, as he discovered by his Microscopes. _Borel. de Mot. Animal._ Part
1. These Fibres, he saith, are naturally white; but derive their Redness
only from the Blood in them.

These Fibres do in every Muscle, (in the Belly at least of the Muscle,)
run parallel to one another, in a neat orderly Form. But they do not
at all tend the same Way, but some run aslant, some longways, _&c._
according to the Action or Position of each respective Muscle. The
Particulars of which, and of divers other Observables in the Muscles,
would, besides Figures, take up too much room in these Notes; and
therefore I must refer to the Anatomists, particularly _Steno_,
_Borelli_, _Cowper_, &c.

[b] The infinite Creator hath generally exerted his Art and Care, in
the Provision made by proper Muscles and Nerves, for all the different
Motions in animal Bodies, both involuntary, and voluntary. It is a noble
Providence that most of the vital Motions, such as of the Heart, Stomach,
Guts, _&c._ are involuntary, the Muscles acting whether we sleep or wake,
whether we will or no. And it is no less providential that some, even
of the vital Motions, are partly voluntary, partly involuntary, as that
for Instance, of Breathing, which is performed both sleeping and waking;
but can be intermitted for a short Time on occasion, as for accurate
hearing any Thing, _&c._ or can be encreased by a stronger Blast, to make
the greater Discharges of the Blood from the Lungs, when that any Thing
overcharges them. And as for the other Motions of the Body, as of the
Limbs, and such as are voluntary, it is a no less Providence, that they
are absolutely under the Power of the Will; so as that the Animal hath it
in his Power to command the Muscles and Spirits of any part of its Body,
to perform such Motions and Actions as it hath Occasion for.

habent, & ad stabilitatem aptas, & ad artus finiendos accommodatas, & ad
motum, & ad omnem corporis actionem._ Cicer. de Nat. Deor. l. 2. c. 55.

By Reason it would be endless to mention all the Curiosities observable
in the Bones, I shall for a Sample, single out only an Instance or two,
to manifest that Design was used in the Structure of these Parts in Man.

The first shall be in the _Back-Bone_, which (among many others) hath
these two Things remarkable. 1. Its different Articulations from the
other Joynts of the Body. For here most of the Joynts are flat, and
withal guarded with Asperities and Hollows, made for catching and
holding; so as firmly to lock and keep the Joynts from Luxations, but
withal to afford them such a Motion, as is necessary for the Incurvations
of the Body. 2. The difference of its own Joynts in the Neck, Back
and Loins. In the Neck, the _Atlas_, or upper _Vertebra_, as also the
_Dentata_, are curiously made, and joynted (differently from the rest)
for the commodious and easie bending and turning the Head every way. In
the _Thorax_, or Back, the Joynts are more close and firm; and in the
Loins, more lax and pliant; as also the Spines are different, and the
Knobs and Sockets turned the quite contrary way, to answer the Occasions
the Body hath to bend more there, than higher in the Back. I shall close
this Remark with the ingenious Dr. _Keil_’s Observation.

_The Structure of the ~Spine~ is the very best that can be contrived; for
had it been all Bone, we could have had no Motion in our Backs; had it
been of two or three Bones articulated for Motion, the ~Medulla Spinalis~
must have been necessarily bruised at every Angle or Joynt; besides,
the whole would not have been so pliable for the several Postures we
have occasion to put our selves in. If it had been made of several Bones
without intervening Cartilages, we should have had no more Use of it,
than if it had been but one Bone. If each ~Vertebra~ had had its own
distinct Cartilages, it might have been easily ~dislocated~. And lastly,
The oblique Processes of each superior and inferior ~Vertebra~, keep
the middle one that it can neither be thrust backwards nor forwards to
compress the ~Medulla Spinalis~._ _Keil_’s _Anat._ c. 5. §. 8.

Compare here what _Galen_ saith of the Articulations, Ligaments,
Perforation, _&c._ of the _Spine_, to prove the Wisdom and Providence of
the Maker of animal Bodies, against such as found fault with Nature’s
Works; among which he names _Diagoras_, _Anaxagoras_, _Asclepiades_ and
_Epicurus_. _V._ _Galen. de Us. Part. L. 12. init._ and _Chap. 11_, _&c._
also _L. 13. init._

2. The next Instance shall be in one or two Things, wherein the Skeletons
of Sexes differ. Thus the _Pelvis_ made in the Belly by the _Ilium_,
_Ossa Coxendicis_ and _Pubis_, is larger in a Female than Male Skeleton,
that there may be more room for the lying of the _Viscera_ and _Fœtus_.
So the Cartilage bracing together the two _Ossa Pubis_, or _Sharebones_,
_Bartholine_ saith, is twice thicker and laxer in Women than Men: As also
is the Cartilage that tieth the _Os Sacrum_ to its _Vertebra_; and all to
give way to the Passage of the _Fœtus_.

Another considerable Difference is in the cartilaginous Production of the
seven long Ribs, whereby they are braced to the Breast-Bone. These are
harder and firmer in Women than in Men; the better to support the Weight
of the Breasts, the sucking Infant, _&c._

[d] It is remarkable in the Joynts, and a manifest Act of Caution and
Design, 1. That altho’ the Motion of the Limbs be circular, yet the
Center of that Motion is not in a Point, but an ample Superficies. In
a Point, the Bones would wear and penetrate one another; the Joynts
would be exceedingly weak, _&c._ but the Joynts consisting of two large
Superficies, Concave and Convex, some furrowed and ridged, some like a
Ball and Socket, and all lubricated with an oily Substance, they are
incomparably prepared both for Motion and Strength. 2. That the Bones
next the Joynt are not spungy, as their Extremities commonly are, nor
hard and brittle, but capped with a strong, tough, smooth, cartilaginous
Substance, serving both to Strength and Motion.

But let us here take notice of what _Galen_ mentions on this Subject.
_Articulorum unusquisque Eminentiam Cavitati immissam habet: Veruntamen
hoc fortasse non adeò mirabile est: Sed si, consideratâ omnium totius
corporis ossium mutuâ connexione, Eminentias cavitatibus suscipientibus
æquales semper inveneris; Hoc mirabile. Si enim justo amplior esset
Cavitas, laxus sanè & infirmus fieret Articulus; si strictior, motus
difficulter fieret, ut qui nullam versionem haberet; ac periculum esset
non parvum, eminintias ossium arctatas frangi: sed horum neutrum factum
est.——Sed quoniam ex tam securâ constructione periculum erat, nè motiones
difficiliùs fierent, & eminentiæ ossium extererentur, duplex rursus
auxilium in id Natura molita est. 1. Cartilagine os utrumque subungens,
atque oblinens: alterum, ipsis Cartilaginibus humorem unctuosum, velut
oleum, superfundens; per quem facilè mobilis, & attritu contumax omnis
articulatio Ossium facta est.——Ut undique diligenter Articulus omnis
custodiretur, Ligamenta quædam ex utroque osse produxit Natura._ Galen de
Us. Part. l. 1. c. 15.

[e] For the affording this oily or mucilaginous Matter, there are
_Glandules_ very commodiously placed near the Joynts, so as not to suffer
too great Compression by the Motion of the neighbouring Bones, and yet
to receive a due Pressure, so as to cause a sufficient Emission of the
Mucilage into the Joynts. Also another Thing considerable is, that the
excretory Ducts of the _mucilaginous Glands_ have some Length in their
Passage from the Glands to their Mouths; which is a good Contrivance, to
prevent their Mouths being oppressed by the Mucilage, as also to hinder
the too plentiful Effusion thereof, but yet to afford a due Expressure
of it at all Times, and on all Occasions, as particularly in violent
and long-continued Motions of the Joynts, when there is a greater than
ordinary Expence of it. See _Cowper_’s _Anat. Tab._ 79.

[f] There is no doubt to be made, but that the Muscles receive their
Motion from the Nerves. For if a Nerve be cut, or straightly bound, that
goes to any Muscle, that Muscle shall immediately lose its Motion. Which
is doubtless the case of Paralyticks; whose Nerves are some of them by
Obstructions, or such like Means, reduced to the same State as if cut or
bound.

And this also is the cause of that _Numness_ or _Sleepiness_ we find
oftentimes, by long sitting or lying on any Part.

Neither is this a modern Notion only: For _Galen_ saith, _Principium
Nervorum omnium Cerebrum est, & spinalis Medulla.——Et Nervi à Cerebro
animalem virtutem accipiunt——Nervorum utilitas est facultatem Sensûs &
Motûs à principio in partes diducere._ And this he intimates to have been
the Opinion of _Hippocrates_ and _Plato_. De Us. Part. l. 1. c. 16. _&
passim_.

[g] Dr. _Willis_ thinks, that in the _Brain_ the Spirits are elaborated
that minister to voluntary Motion; but in the _Cerebellum_, such as
effect involuntary, or natural Motions; such as that of the Heart, the
Lungs, _&c._ _Cerebri Anat._ c. 15.

[h] See _Book V. Chap. 8._

[i] To the foregoing, I shall briefly add some Examples of the special
Provision made for the Motion of some Animals by _Temporary Parts_.
_Frogs_ and _Toads_, in their _Tadpole-state_, have Tails, which fall off
when their Legs are grown out. The _Lacerta aquatica_, or _Water-Newt_,
when Young, hath four neat ramified Fins, two on a Side, growing out a
little above its Fore-Legs, to poise and keep its Body upright, (which
gives it the Resemblance of a young Fish,) which fall off when the Legs
are grown. And the _Nymphæ_ and _Aureliæ_, of all or most of the Insects
bred in the Waters, as they have particular Forms, different from the
Insects they produce; so have also peculiar Parts afforded them for their
Motion in the Waters: Oars, Tails, and every Part adapted to the Waters,
which are utterly varied in the Insects themselves, in their mature State
in the Air.

alia volando, alia nando._ Cic. de Nat. Deor. l. 2. c. 47.

Compare also what _Galen_ excellently observes concerning the Number of
Feet in Man, and in other Animals; and the wise Provision thereby made
for the Use and Benefit of the respective Animals. _De Us. Part._ in the
beginning of the third Book.

[l] As I shall hereafter shew, that the indulgent Creator hath
abundantly provided for the Safety of Animals by their Cloathing,
Habitations, Sagacity and Instruments of Defence; so there appears to be
a Contemperament of their _Motion_ with these Provisions. They that are
well armed and guarded, have commonly a slower Motion; whereas they that
are destitute thereof, are swifter. So also timid helpless Animals are
commonly swift; thus Deer and Hares: But Animals endowed with Courage,
Craft, Arms, _&c._ commonly have a slower Motion.

[q] The Make of the Bodies of some Water-fowl, seems to contradict what
I here say, the Heads and long Necks of some, as of Swans, Ducks and
Geese; and the hinder Parts of others, as of the Doucker and More-hen,
and some other Kinds, seeming to be too heavy for the rest of their Body.
But instead of being an Argument against, it is a notable Instance of,
the divine Art and Providence, these Things being nice Accommodations to
their way of Life. Of such as have long Necks, see _Book VII. Chap. 2.
Note (i)._

And as for such whose hinder Parts seem to over-balance their foremost
Parts, whereby they fly with their Bodies in a manner erect, this also is
an excellent Accommodation to their way of Life, which is Diving rather
than Flying. _Vid._ _Book VII. Chap. 4. Note (k)._

_Of the Place allotted to the several Tribes of Animals._


Having dispatched the Motion of Animals, let us in the next Place
consider the _Place_ which the infinitely wise Creator hath appointed
them to move and act, and perform the Offices of the Creation in. And
here we find every Particular well ordered. All Parts of our Terraqueous
Globe fit for an Animal to live and act in, are sufficiently stocked
with proper Inhabitants: The watery Element (unfit, one would think,
for Respiration and Life) abounding with Creatures fitted for it; its
Bowels abundantly stored, and its Surface well bespread. The Earth also
is plentifully stocked in all its Parts, where Animals can be of any
Use; not probably the deepest Bowels thereof indeed, being Parts in all
likelihood unfit for Habitation and Action, and where a living Creature
would be useless in the World; but the Surface every where abundantly
stored.

But that which is most considerable in this Matter, and plainly sheweth
the divine Management in the Case, is, that those Creatures are
manifestly designed for the Place in which they are, and the Use and
Services they perform therein. If all the Animals of our Globe had been
made by Chance, or placed by Chance, or without the divine Providence,
their Organs would have been otherwise than they are, and their Place
and Residence confused and jumbled. Their Organs (for Instance) of
Respiration, of Vision, and of Motion, would have fitted any _Medium_, or
have needed none; their Stomachs would have served any Food, and their
Blood, and Covering of their Bodies been made for any Clime, or only one
Clime. Consequently all the Animal World would have been in a confused,
inconvenient, and disorderly Commixture. One Animal would have wanted
Food, another Habitation, and most of them Safety. They would have all
flocked to one, or a few Places, taken up their Rest in the Temperate
Zones only, and coveted one Food, the easiest to be come at, and most
specious in shew; and so would have poisoned, starved, or greatly
incommoded one another. Bur as the Matter is now ordered, the Globe is
equally bespread, so that no Place wanteth proper Inhabitants, nor any
Creature is destitute of a proper Place, and all Things necessary to its
Life, Health, and Pleasure. As the Surface of the Terraqueous Globe is
covered with different Soils, with Hills and Vales, with Seas, Rivers,
Lakes and Ponds, with divers Trees and Plants, in the several Places; so
all these have their Animal Inhabitants, whole Organs of Life and Action
are manifestly adapted to such and such Places and Things; whose Food
and Physick, and every other Convenience of Life, is to be met with in
that very Place appointed it. The watery, the amphibious[a], the airy
Inhabitants, and those on the dry Land Surface, and the Subterraneous
under it, they all live and act with Pleasure, they are gay, and flourish
in their proper Element and allotted Place, they want neither for Food,
Cloathing, or Retreat; which would dwindle and die, destroy, or poison
one another, if all coveted the same Element, Place, or Food.

Nay, and as the Matter is admirably well ordered, yet considering the
World’s increase, there would not be sufficient Room, Food, and other
Necessaries for all the living Creatures, without another grand Act of
the divine Wisdom and Providence, which is the _Balancing the Number
of Individuals_ of each Species of Creatures, in that Place appointed
thereto: Of which in the next Chapter.

_Of the Balance of Animals, or the due Proportion in which the World is
flocked with them._


The whole Surface of our Globe can afford Room and Support only to such a
Number of all Sorts of Creatures. And if by their doubling, trebling, or
any other Multiplication of their Kind, they should encrease to double or
treble that Number, they must starve, or devour one another. The keeping
therefore the Balance even, is manifestly a Work of the divine Wisdom
and Providence. To which end, the great Author of Life hath determined
the Life of all Creatures to such a Length, and their Increase to such
a Number, proportional to their Use in the World. The Life of some
Creatures is long, and their Increase but small, and by that means they
do not over-stock the World. And the same Benefit is effected, where the
Increase is great, by the Brevity of such Creatures Lives, by their great
Use, and the frequent Occasions there are of them for Food to Man, or
other Animals. It is a very remarkable Act of the Divine Providence, that
useful Creatures are produced in great Plenty[a], and others in less.
The prodigious and frequent Increase of Insects, both in and out of the
Waters, may exemplify the one; and ’tis observable in the other, that
Creatures less useful, or by their Voracity pernicious, have commonly
fewer Young, or do seldomer bring forth: Of which many Instances might
be given in the voracious Beasts and Birds. But there is one so peculiar
an Animal, as if made for a particular Instance in our present Case, and
that is the _Cuntur_ of _Peru_[b]: A Fowl of that Magnitude, Strength and
Appetite, as to seize not only on the Sheep, and lesser Cattle, but even
the larger Beasts, yea, the very Children too. Now these, as they are the
most pernicious of Birds, so are they the most rare, being seldom seen,
or only one, or a few in large Countries; enough to keep up the Species;
but not to over-charge the World.

Thus the Balance of the animal World, is, throughout all Ages, kept even;
and by a curious Harmony, and just Proportion between the Increase of all
Animals, and the Length of their Lives, the World is through all Ages
well; but not over-stored: _One Generation passeth away, and another
Generation cometh_[c]; so equally in its Room, to balance the Stock of
the terraqueous Globe in all Ages, and Places, and among all Creatures;
that it is an actual Demonstration of our Saviour’s Assertion, _Mat._ x.
29. that the most inconsiderable, common Creature, _Even a Sparrow (two
of which are sold for a Farthing) doth not fall on the Ground without our
heavenly Father._

This Providence of God is remarkable in every Species of living
Creatures: But that especial Management of the Recruits and Decays
of Mankind, so equally all the World over, deserves our especial
Observation. In the Beginning of the World, and so after _Noah_’s
Flood, the Longævity of Men, as it was of absolute Necessity to the
more speedy peopling of the new World; so is a special Instance of the
divine Providence in this Matter[d]. And the same Providence appears in
the following Ages, when the World was pretty well peopled, in reducing
the common Age of Man then to 120 Years, (_Gen._ vi. 3.) in Proportion
to the Occasions of the World at that Time. And lastly, when the World
was fully peopled after the Flood, (as it was in the Age of _Moses_, and
so down to our present Time) the lessening the common Age of Man to 70
or 80 Years[e], (the Age mentioned by _Moses_, _Psal_. xc. 10. this, I
say,) is manifestly an Appointment of the same infinite Lord that ruleth
the World: For, by this Means, the peopled World is kept at a convenient
Stay; neither too full, nor too empty. For if Men (the Generality of
them, I mean) were to live now to _Methusalah_’s Age of 969 Years, or
only to _Abraham_’s, long after the Flood, of 175 Years, the World would
be too much over-run; or if the Age of Man was limited to that of divers
other Animals, to ten, twenty, or thirty Years only; the Decays then of
Mankind would be too fast: But at the middle Rate mentioned, the Balance
is nearly even, and Life and Death keep an equal Pace. Which Equality
is so great and harmonious, and so manifest an Instance of the divine
Management, that I shall spend some Remarks upon it.

It appears from our best Accounts of these Matters, that in our
_European_ Parts[f], and I believe the same is throughout the World;
that, I say, there is a certain Rate and Proportion in the Propagation of
Mankind: Such a Number marry[g], so many are born, such a Number die; in
Proportion to the Number of Persons in every Nation, County, or Parish.
And as to Births, two Things are very considerable: One is the Proportion
of Males and Females[h], not in a wide Proportion, not an uncertain,
accidental Number at all Adventures; but nearly equal. Another Thing is,
that a few more are born than appear to die, in any certain Place[i].
Which is an admirable Provision for the extraordinary Emergencies and
Occasions of the World; to supply unhealthful Places, where Death
out-runs Life; to make up the Ravages of great Plagues, and Diseases, and
the Depredations of War, and the Seas; and to afford a sufficient Number
for Colonies in the unpeopled Parts of the Earth. Or on the other Hand,
we may say, that sometimes those extraordinary Expences of Mankind, may
be not only a just Punishment of the Sins of Men; but also a wise Means
to keep the Balance of Mankind even; as one would be ready to conclude,
by considering the _Asiatick_, and other the more fertile Countries,
where prodigious Multitudes are yearly swept away with great Plagues, and
sometimes War; and yet those Countries are so far from being wasted, that
they remain full of People.

And now upon the whole Matter, What is all this but admirable and plain
Management? What can the maintaining throughout all Ages, and Places,
these Proportions of Mankind, and all other Creatures; this Harmony in
the Generations of Men be, but the Work of one that ruleth the World? Is
it possible that every Species of Animals should so evenly be preserved,
proportionate to the Occasions of the World? That they should be so well
balanced in all Ages and Places, without the Help of almighty Wisdom and
Power? How is it possible by the bare Rules, and blind Acts of Nature,
that there should be any tolerable Proportion; for Instance, between
Males and Females, either of Mankind, or of any other Creature[k];
especially such as are of a ferine, not of a domestick Nature, and
consequently out of the Command and Management of Man? How could Life
and Death keep such an even Pace through all the animal World? If we
should take it for granted, that, according to the Scripture History, the
World had a Beginning, (as who can deny it[l]; or if we should suppose
the Destruction thereof by _Noah_’s Flood: How is it possible, after
the World was replenished,) that in a certain Number of Years, by the
greater Increases and Doublings of each Species of Animals; that, I say,
this Rate of Doubling[m] should cease; or that it should be compensated
by some other Means? That the World should be as well, or better stocked
than now it is, in 1656 Years (the Time between the Creation and the
Flood; this) we will suppose may be done by the natural Methods of each
Species Doubling or Increase: But in double that Number of Years, or at
this Distance from the Flood, of 4000 Years, that the World should not
be over stock’d, can never be made out, without allowing an infinite
Providence.

I conclude then this Observation with the Psalmist’s Words, _Psal._ civ.
29, 30. _Thou hidest thy Face, all Creatures are troubled; thou takest
away their Breath, they die, and return to their Dust. Thou sendest forth
thy Spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the Face of the Earth._

~Mocha~, an Island in the South-Sea,——they shot it sitting on a Cliff, by
the Sea-side; that it was 16 Feet from Wing to Wing extended; that the

they should prey upon their Children. And the Feather he gave me_ (saith

Fierceness, deny’d them the Talons which are given to the ~Eagle~; their
Feet being tipp’d with Claws like a Hen: However, their Beak is strong

them will attempt a ~Cow~ or ~Bull~, and devour him: And it hath often
happened, that one of then alone hath assaulted Boys of ten or twelve
Years of Age, and eaten them. Their Colour is black and white, like a
~Magpie~. It is well there are but few of them; for if they were many,
they would very much destroy the Cattle. They have on the forepart of
their Heads, a Comb, not pointed like that of a ~Cock~; but rather even,
in the Form of a Razor. When they come to alight from the Air, they make
such an humming Noise, with the fluttering of their Wings, as is enough
to astonish, or make a Man deaf._

[c] _Eccles._ i. 4.

[d] The Divine Providence doth not only appear in the Longævity of Man,
immediately after the Creation and Flood; but also in their different
Longævity at those two Times. Immediately after the Creation, when
the World was to be peopled by one Man, and one Woman, the Age of the
greatest Part of those on Record, was 900 Years, and upwards. But after
the Flood, when there were three Persons by whom the World was to be
peopled, none of those Patriarchs, except _Shem_, arriv’d to the Age
of 500; and only the three first of _Shem_’s Line, _viz._ _Arphaxad_,
_Salah_, and _Eber_, came near that Age; which was in the first Century
after the Flood. But in the second Century, we do not find any reached
the Age of 240. And in the third Century, (about the latter End of which
_Abraham_ was born,) none, except _Terah_, arriv’d to 200 Years: By which
Time the World was so well peopled, (that Part of it, at least where
_Abraham_ dwelt,) that they had built Cities, and began to be cantoned
into distinct Nations and Societies, under their respective Kings; so
that they were able to wage War, four Kings against five, _Gen._ xiv.
Nay, if the Accounts of _Anian_, _Berosus_, _Manetho_, and others, yea,
_Africanus_ be to be credited; the World was so well peopled, even before
the Times we speak of, as to afford sufficient Numbers for the great
Kingdoms of _Assyria_, _Ægypt_, _Persia_, &c. But learned Men generally,
with great Reason, reject these as legendary Accounts. If the Reader
hath a Mind to see a Computation of the Increase of Mankind, in the
three first Centuries after the Flood, he may find two different Ones
of the most learned Archbishop _Usher_, and _Petavius_; together with a
Refutation of the so early Beginning of the _Assyrian Monarchy_; as also
Reasons for placing _Abraham_ near 1000 Years after the Flood, in our
most learned Bishop _Stillingfleet_’s _Orig. Sacr._ Book III. Chap. 4. §.
9.

[e] That the common Age of Man hath been the same in all Ages since the
World was peopled, is manifest from prophane, as well as sacred History.
To pass by others: _Plato_ lived to the Age of 81, and was accounted
an old Man. And those which _Pliny_ reckons up, _l. 7. c. 48._ as rare
Examples of long Life, may for the most Part be match’d by our modern
Histories; especially such as _Pliny_ himself gave Credit unto. Dr.
_Plot_ hath given us divers Instances in his History of _Oxfordshire_,
c. 2. §. 3. and c. 8. §. 54. and History of _Staffordshire_, c. 8. §.
91, _&c._ Among others, one is of twelve Tenants of Mr. _Biddulph_’s,
that together made 1000 Years of Age. But the most considerable Examples
of aged Persons among us, is of old _Parre_ of _Shropshire_, who lived
152 Years 9 Months, according to the learned Dr. _Harvey_’s Account; and
_Henry Jenkins_ of _Yorkshire_, who lived 169 Years, according to the
Account of my learned and ingenious Friend Dr. _Tancred Robinson_; of
both which, with others, see _Lowth. Abridg. Phil. Trans._ V. 3. p. 306.
The great Age of _Parre_ of _Shropshire_, minds me of an Observation of
the Reverend Mr. _Plaxton_, that in his two Parishes of _Kinardsey_ and
_Donington_ in _Shropshire_, every sixth Soul was 60 Years of Age, or
upwards, _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 310.

And if we step farther North into _Scotland_, we shall find divers
recorded for their great Age: Of which I shall present the Reader with
only one modern Example of one _Laurence_, who married a Wife after he
was 100 Years of Age, and would go out to Sea a Fishing in his little
Boat, when he was 140 Years old; and is lately dead of no other Distemper
but mere old Age, saith Sir _Rob. Sibbald_, _Prodr. Hist. Nat. Scot._ p.
44. _and_ l. 3. p. 4.

As for Foreigners, the Examples would be endless; and therefore that of
_Joh. Ottele_ shall suffice, who was as famous for his Beard, as for
being 115 Years of Age. He was but two _Brabant_ Ells ³⁄₉ high; and his
long grey Beard was one Ell ¼ long. His Picture and Account may be seen
in _Ephem. Germ. T. 3. Obs. 163._

As for the Story _Roger Bacon_ tells, of one that lived 900 Years by the
Help of a certain Medicine, and many other such Stories, I look upon
them as fabulous. And no better is that of the _Wandring Jew_, named
_Joh. Buttadæus_, said to have been present at our Saviour’s Crucifixion;
although very serious Stories are told of his being seen at _Antwerp_,
and in _France_, about the Middle of the last Century but one; and
before in _Ann. 1542_, conversed with by _Paul_ of _Eitsen_, Bishop of
_Sleswick_; and before that, _viz._ in 1228, seen and convers’d with by
an _Armenian Archbishop_’s _Gentleman_; and by others at other Times.

If the Reader hath a Mind to see more Examples, he may meet with some
of all Ages, in the learned _Hakewill’s Apol. p. 181._ where he will
also find that learned Author’s Opinion of the Causes of the Brevity and
Length of humane Life. The Brevity thereof he attributeth to a too tender
Education, sucking strange Nurses, too hasty Marriages; but above all, to
Luxury, high Sauces, strong Liquors, _&c._ The Longævity of the Ancients
he ascribes to Temperance in Meat and Drink, anointing the Body, the
Use of Saffron and Honey, warm Clothes, lesser Doors and Windows, less
Physick and more Exercise.

Which Table I made from Major _Graunt_’s Observations on the Bills of
Mortality; Mr. _King_’s Observations in the first of Dr. _Davenant_’s
_Essays_; and what I find put together by my ingenious Friend Mr.
_Lowthorp_, in his _Abridgment_, Vol. 3. p. 668. and my own Register of
_Upminster_. That from _Aynho_ Register in _Northamptonshire_, I had
from the present Rector, the learned and ingenious Mr. _Wasse_: And I
was promised some Accounts from the North, and divers others Parts of
this Kingdom; but have not yet received them: Only those of _Leeds_
and _Harwood_ in _Yorkshire_, from my curious and ingenious friend Mr.
_Thoresby_.

[g] The preceding Table shews, that Marriages, one with another, do each
of them produce about four Births; not only in _England_, but in other
Parts of _Europe_ also.

And by Mr. _King_’s Estimate, (the best Computations I imagine of any,
being derived from the best Accounts; such as the Marriage, Birth,
Burial-Act, the Poll Books, _&c._ by his Estimate, I say,) about 1 in
104 marry. For he judgeth the Number of the People in _England_, to be
about five Millions and a half; of which about 41000 annually marry. As
to what might be farther remarked concerning Marriages, in regard of the
Rights and Customs of several Nations, the Age to which divers Nations
limited Marriage, _&c._ it would be Endless, and too much out of the Way
to mention them: I shall only therefore, for the Reader’s Diversion,
take Notice of the Jeer of _Lactantias_, _Quare apud Poetas salacissimus
~Jupiter~ desiit liberos tollere? Utrum sexagenarius factus, & ei Lex
Papia fibulam imposuit?_ Lactant. Instit. l. 1. c. 16. By which _Lex
Papia_, Men were prohibited to marry after 60, and Women after 50 Years
of Age.

[h] _Major Graunt_, (whose Conclusions seem to be well-grounded,) and Mr.
_King_, disagree in the Proportions they assign to Males and Females.
This latter makes in _London_, 10 Males to be to 13 Females; in other
Cities and Market-Towns, 8 to 9; and in the Villages and Hamlets, 100
Males to 99 Females. But Major _Graunt_, both from the _London_, and
_Country_ Bills, saith, there are 14 Males to 13 Females: From whence he
justly infers, _That Christian Religion, prohibiting Polygamy, is more
agreeable to the Law of Nature than_ Mahumetism, _and others that allow
it_, Chap. 8.

This Proportion of 14 to 13, I imagine is nearly just, it being agreeable
to the Bills I have met with, as well as those in Mr. _Graunt_. In the
100 Years, for Example, of my own Parish-Register, although the Burials
of Males and Females were nearly equal, being 636 Males, and 623 Females
in all that Time; yet there were baptized 709 Males, and but 675 Females,
which is 13 Females to 13.7 Males. Which Inequality shews, not only,
that one Man ought to have but one Wife; but also that every Woman may,
without Polygamy, have an Husband, if she doth not bar her self by the
want of Virtue, by Denial, _&c._ Also this Surplusage of Males is very
useful for the Supplies of War, the Seas, and other such Expences of the
Men above the Women.

That this is a Work of the Divine Providence, and not a Matter of Chance,
is well made out by the very Laws of Chance, by a Person able to do it,
the ingenious and learned Dr. _Arbuthnot_. He supposeth _Thomas_ to lay
against _John_, that for eighty two Years running, more Males shall
be born than Females; and giving all Allowances in the Computation to
_Thomas_’s side, he makes the Odds against _Thomas_, that it doth not
happen so, to be near five Millions of Millions, of Millions, of Millions
to one; but for Ages of Ages (according to the World’s Age) to be near an
infinite Number to one against _Thomas_. _Vid._ _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 328.

[i] The foregoing Table shews, that in _England_ in general fewer die
than are born, there being but 1 Death to 1¹²⁄₁₀₀ Births. But in _London_
more die than are born. So by Dr. _Davenant_’s Table, the Cities likewise
and Market-Towns bury ⁷⁄₁₀₀ to one Birth. But in _Paris_ they out-do
_London_, their Deaths being 1½ to one Birth: The Reason of which I
conceive is, because their Houses are more crowded than in _London_. But
in the Villages of _England_, there are fewer die than are born, there
being but 1 Death to 1¹⁷⁄₁₀₀ Births. And yet Major _Graunt_, and Dr.
_Davenant_, both observe, that there are more Breeders in _London_, and
the Cities and Market-Towns, than are in the Country, notwithstanding the
_London_-Births are fewer than the Country; the Reason of which see in
_Graunt_, _Chap. 7._ and _Davenant ubi supr. p. 21._

The last Remark I shall make from the foregoing Table, shall be, that we
may from thence judge of the Healthfulness of the Places there mentioned.
If the Year 1698 was the mean Account of the three _Marcks_, those Places
bid the fairest for being most healthful; and next to them, _Aynho_ and
_Cranbrook_ for _English_ Towns.

earum generis appareat? Nam primum aliæ Mares, aliæ Fœminæ sunt, quod
perpetuitatis causâ machinata natura est._ Cic. de Nat. Deor. l. 2. c. 51.

[l] Altho’ _Aristotle_ held the Eternity of the World, yet he seems to
have retracted that Opinion, or to have had a different Opinion when he
wrote his _Metaphysicks_; for in his first Book he affirms, that _God
is the Cause and Beginning of all Things_; and in his Book _de Mundo_
he saith, _There is no doubt, but God is the Maker and Conservator of
all Things in the World_. And the _Stoicks_ Opinion is well known, who
strenuously contended that the Contrivance and Beauty of the Heavens and
Earth, and all Creatures was owing to a wise, intelligent Agent. Of which
_Tully_ gives a large Account in his second Book _de Nat. Deor._ in the
Person of _Balbus_.

[m] I have before in _Note (g)_, observed, that the ordinary rate of
the Doubling or Increase of Mankind is, that every Marriage, one with
another, produces about four Births; but some have much exceeded that.
_Babo_, Earl of _Abensperg_, had thirty two Sons and eight Daughters,
and being invited to hunt with the Emperor _Henry_ II. and bring but few
Servants, brought only one Servant, and his thirty two Sons. To these
many others might be added; but one of the most remarkable Instances
I have any where met with, is that of Mrs. _Honywood_, mentioned by
_Hakewill_, _Camden_, and other Authors; but having now before me the
Names, with some Remarks (which I received from a pious neighbouring
Descendant of the same Mrs. _Honywood_) I shall give a more particular
Account than they. Mrs. _Mary Honywood_ was Daughter, and one of the
Co-Heiresses of _Robert Atwaters_, Esq; of _Lenham_ in _Kent_. She was
born in 1527, married in _February_ 1543, at sixteen Years of Age, to her
only Husband _Robert Honywood_, of _Charing_ in _Kent_, Esq; She died in
the ninety third Year of her Age, in _May 1620_. She had sixteen Children
of her own Body, seven Sons and nine Daughters; of which one had no
issue, three died young, and the youngest was slain at _Newport Battle_,
_June 20, 1600_. Her Grand-Children in the second Generation, were one
hundred and fourteen; in the third two hundred and twenty eight; and nine
in the fourth Generation. So that she could say the same that the Distick
doth, made of one of the _Dalburg_’s Family of _Basil_:

       1         2         3           4
    _Mater ait Natæ, dic Natæ, filia Natam_

                  5                 6
    _Ut moneat, Natæ, plangere Filiolam._

      1         2                       3
    _Rise up Daughter, and go to thy Daughter,_

                4         5               6
    _for her Daughters Daughter hath a Daughter._

Mrs. _Honywood_ was a very pious Woman, afflicted, in her declining
Age, with Despair, in some measure; concerning which, some Divines once
discoursing with her, she in a Passion said, _She was as certainly damned
as this Glass is broken_, throwing a _Venice_-Glass against the Ground,
which she had then in her Hand. But the Glass escaped breaking, as
credible Witnesses attested.




CHAP. XI.

_Of the Food of Animals._


The preceding Reflection of the _Psalmist_, mindeth me of another Thing
in common to Animals, that pertinently falleth next under Consideration,
which is the _Appointment of Food_, mentioned in Verse 27, 28, of the
last cited _Psalm_ civ. _These ~[Creatures]~ wait all upon thee, that
thou may’st give them their Meat in due Season. That thou givest them,
they gather; thou openest thy Hand, they are filled with Good._ The same
is again asserted in _Psal_. cxlv. 15, 16. _The Eyes of all wait upon
thee, and thou givest them their Meat in due Season. Thou openest thy
Hand, and satisfiest the Desire of every living Thing._

What the _Psalmist_ here asserts, affords us a glorious Scene of the
divine Providence and Management. Which, (as I have shew’d it to concern
it self in other lesser Things;) so we may presume doth exert it self
particularly in so grand an Affair as that of Food, whereby the animal
World subsists: And this will be manifested, and the _Psalmist_’s
Observations exemplified, from these six following Particulars:

I. From the subsisting and maintaining such a large Number of Animals,
throughout all Parts of the World.

II. From the proportionate Quantity of Food to the Eaters.

III. From the Variety of Food suited to the Variety of Animals: Or the
Delight which various Animals have in different Food.

IV. From the peculiar Food which peculiar Places afford to the Creatures
suited to those Places.

V. From the admirable and curious Apparatus made for the gathering,
preparing, and Digestion of the Food. And,

VI. _and lastly_, From the great Sagacity of all Animals, in finding out
and providing their Food.

I. It is a great Act of the divine Power and Wisdom, as well as Goodness,
to provide Food for such a World of Animals[a], as every where possess
the terraqueous Globe; on the dry Land; and in the Sea and Waters; in the
torrid and frozen Zones, as well as the temperate. That the temperate
Climates, or at least the fertile Valleys, and rich and plentiful Regions
of the Earth, should afford Subsistence to many Animals, may appear less
wonderful perhaps: But that in all other the most likely Places for
Supplies sufficient Food should be afforded to such a prodigious Number,
and so great Variety of Beasts, Birds, Fishes and Insects; is owing to
that Being, who hath as wisely adapted their Bodies to their Place and
Food, as well as carefully provided Food for their Subsistence there.

But I shall leave this Consideration, because it will be illustrated
under the following Points; and proceed,

II. To consider the Adjustment of the Quantity of Food, in Proportion
to the Eaters. In all Places there is generally enough; nay, such a
Sufficiency, as may be styled a Plenty; but not such a Superfluity,
as to waste and corrupt, and thereby annoy the World. But that which
is particularly remarkable here, is, that among the great Variety of
Foods, the most useful is the most plentiful, most universal, easiest
propagated, and most patient of Weather, and other Injuries. As the
herbaceous Eaters, (for Instance) are many, and devour much; so the
dryland Surface we find every where almost naturally carpeted over with
Grass, and other agreeable wholsome Plants; propagating themselves in a
Manner every where, and scarcely destroyable by the Weather, the Plough,
or any Art. So likewise for Grain, especially such as is most useful,
how easily is it cultivated, and what a large Increase doth it produce?
_Pliny_’s Example of Wheat[b], is a sufficient Instance in this Matter;
which (as that curious Heathen observes) being principally useful to the
Support of Man, is easily propagated, and in great Plenty: And an happy
Faculty that is of it, that it can bear either extreams of Heat or Cold,
so as scarce to refuse any Clime.

III. Another wise Provision the Creator hath made relating to the Food
of Animals, is, that various Animals delight in various Food[c]; some
in Grass and Herbs; some in Grain and Seeds; some in Flesh; some in
Insects; some in this[d], some in that; some more delicate and nice; some
voracious and catching at any Thing. If all delighted in, or subsisted
only with one Sort of Food, there would not be sufficient for all; but
every Variety chusing various Food, and perhaps abhorring that which
others like, is a great and wise Means that every Kind hath enough, and
oftentimes somewhat to spare.

It deserves to be reckoned as an Act of the divine Appointment, that what
is wholesome Food to one, is nauseous, and as a Poyson to another; what
is a sweet and delicate Smell and Taste to one, is fœtid and loathsome
to another: By which Means all the Provisions the Globe affords are
well dispos’d of. Not only every Creature is well provided for, but a
due Consumption is made of those Things that otherwise would encumber
the World, lie in the Way, corrupt, rot, stink and annoy, instead of
cherishing and refreshing it. For our most useful Plants, Grain and
Fruits, would mould and rot; those Beasts, Fowls and Fishes, which are
reckoned among the greatest Dainties, would turn to Carrion, and poyson
us: Nay, those Animals which are become Carrion, and many other Things
that are noysome, both on the Dry-land, and in the Waters, would be
great Annoyances, and breed Diseases, was it nor for the Provision which
the infinite Orderer of the World hath made, by causing these Things
to be sweet, pleasant, and wholsome Food to some Creature or other, in
the Place where those Things fall: To Dogs, Ravens, and other voracious
Animals, for Instance, on the Earth; and to rapacious Fishes, and other
Creatures inhabiting the Waters.

Thus is the World in some Measure kept sweet and clean, and at the same
Time, divers Species of Animals supply’d with convenient Food. Which
Providence of God, particularly in the Supplies afforded the _Ravens_, is
divers Times taken Notice of in the Scriptures[e]; but whether for the
Reasons now hinted, or any other special Reasons, I shall not enquire.
Thus our Saviour, _Luke_ xii. 24. _Consider the Ravens; for they neither
sow nor reap, which neither have Storehouse, nor Barn, and God feedeth
them._ It is a manifest Argument of the divine Care and Providence,
in supplying the World with Food and Necessaries, that the _Ravens_,
accounted as unclean, and little regarded by Man, destitute of Stores,
and that live by Accidents, by what falleth here and there; that such a
Bird, I say, should be provided with sufficient Food; especially if that
be true, which _Aristotle_[f], _Pliny_[g], and _Ælian_[h], report of
their unnatural Affection and Cruelty to their Young: “That they expel
them their Nests as soon as they can fly, and then drive them out of the
Country”.

Thus having considered the wise Appointment of the Creator, in suiting
the Variety of Food, to Variety of Animals: Let us in the

IV. Place, Take a View of the peculiar Food, which particular Places
afford to the Creatures inhabiting therein.

It hath been already observed[i], that every Place on the Surface of
the terraqueous Globe, is stocked with proper Animals, whose Organs of
Life and Action are curiously adapted to each respective Place. Now it
is an admirable Act of the divine Providence, that every Place affords a
proper Food to all the living Creatures therein. All the various Regions
of the World, the different Climates[k], the various Soils, the Seas,
the Waters, nay our very Putrefactions, and most nasty Places about the
Globe, as they are inhabited by some or other Animal, so they produce
some proper Food or other, affording a comfortable Subsistence to the
Creatures living there. I might for Instances[l] of this, bring the
great Variety of Herbs, Fruits and Grains on the Earth, the large Swarms
of Insects in the Air, with every other Food of the Creatures residing
in the Earth, or flying in the Air. But I shall stop at the _Waters_,
because the _Psalmist_, in the fore-cited civᵗʰ _Psalm_, speaks with
relation to the especial Provision for the Inhabitants of the Waters; and
also by reason that many Land Animals have their chief Maintenance from
thence.

Now one would think, that the Waters were a very unlikely Element
to produce Food for so great a Number of Creatures, as have their
Subsistence from thence. But yet how rich a Promptuary is it, not only
to large multitudes of Fishes, but also to many amphibious Quadrupeds,
Insects, Reptiles, and Birds! From the largest _Leviathan_, which the
_Psalmist_ saith[m] _playeth in the Seas_, to the smallest Mite in the
Lakes and Ponds, all are plentifully provided for; as is manifest from
the Fatness of their Bodies, and the Gaiety of their Aspect and Actions.

And the Provision which the Creator hath made for this Service in the
Waters is very observable; not only by the Germination of divers aquatick
Plants there, but particularly by appointing the Waters to be the Matrix
of many Animals, particularly of many of the Insect-Kind, not only of
such as are peculiar to the Waters, but also of many appertaining to the
Air and the Land, who, by their near Alliance to the Waters, delight to
be about them, and by that means become a Prey, and plentiful Food to the
Inhabitants of the Waters. And besides these, what prodigious Shoals do
we find of minute Animals, even sometimes discolouring the Waters[n]! Of
these (not only in the Water, but in the Air and on Land) I have always
thought there was some more than ordinary Use intended by the All-wise
Creator. And having bent many of my Observations that way, I have
evidently found it accordingly to be. For be they never so numberless or
minute, those Animals serve for Food to some Creatures or other. Even
those Animalcules in the Waters, discoverable only with good Microscopes,
are a Repast to others there, as I have often with no less Admiration
than Pleasure seen[o].

But now the usual Objection is, that Necessity maketh Use[p]. Animals
must be fed, and they make use of what they find: In the desolate
Regions, and in the Waters, for Instance, they feed upon what they can
come at; but, when in greater Plenty, they pick and chuse.

But this Objection hath been already in some measure answered by what
hath been said; which plainly argues Design, and a super-intending
Wisdom, Power and Providence in this special Business of Food.
Particularly the different Delight of divers Animals in different Food,
so that what is nauseous to one, should be Dainties to another, is a
manifest Argument, that the Allotment of Food is not a Matter of mere
Chance, but entailed to the very Constitution and Nature of Animals; that
they chuse this, and refuse that, not by Accident, or Necessity, but
because the one is a proper Food, agreeable to their Constitution, and
so appointed by the infinite Contriver of their Bodies; and the other is
disagreeable and injurious to them.

But all this Objection will be found frivolous, and the Wisdom and Design
of the great Creator will demonstratively appear, if we take a Survey,

V. Of the admirable and curious Apparatus in all Animals, made for the
Gathering, Preparing and Digestion of their Food. From the very first
Entrance, to the utmost Exit of the Food, we find every Thing contrived,
made and disposed with the utmost Dexterity and Art, and curiously
adapted to the Place the Animal liveth in, and the Food it is to be
nourished with.

Let us begin with the _Mouth_. And this we find, in every Species of
Animals, nicely conformable to the Use of such a Part; neatly sized and
shaped for the catching of Prey, for the gathering or receiving Food[q],
for the Formation of Speech, and every other such like Use[r]. In some
Creatures it is wide and large, in some little and narrow: in some with
a deep Incisure up into the Head[s], for the better catching and holding
of Prey, and more easy Comminution of hard, large and troublesome Food;
in others with a much shorter Incisure, for the gathering and holding of
herbaceous Food.

In _Insects_ it is very notable. In some forcipated; to catch hold and
tear their Prey[t]. In some aculeated, to pierce and wound Animals[u],
and suck their Blood. And in others strongly rigged with Jaws and Teeth,
to gnaw and scrape out their Food, to carry Burdens[w] to perforate the
Earth, yea the hardest Wood, yea even Stones themselves, for Houses[x]
to themselves, and Nests for their young.

And lastly, in _Birds_ it is no less remarkable. In the first Place,
it is neatly shaped for piercing the Air, and making Way for the Body
thro’ the airy Regions. In the next Place, it is hard and horny, which
is a good Supplement for the want of Teeth, and causeth the Bill to have
the Use and Service of the Hand. It’s hooked Form is of great Use to
the rapacious Kind[y], in catching and holding their Prey, and in the
Comminution thereof by tearing; to others it is no less serviceable to
their Climbing, as well as neat and nice Comminution of their Food[z].
Its extraordinary Length and Slenderness is very useful to some, to
search and grope for their Food in moorish Places[aa]; as its Length
and Breadth is to others to hunt and search in muddy Places[bb]: And
the contrary Form, namely, a thick, short, and sharp-edg’d Bill, is as
useful to other Birds, who have occasion to husk and flay the Grains
they swallow. But it would be endless, and tedious, to reckon up all
the various Shapes, and commodious Mechanism of all; the Sharpness and
Strength of those who have Occasion to perforate Wood and Shells[cc]; the
Slenderness and Neatness of such as pick up small Insects; the Cross-form
of such as break up Fruits[dd]; the compressed Form of others[ee], with
many other curious and artificial Forms, all suited to the Way of Living,
and peculiar Occasions of the several Species of Birds. Thus much for the
Mouth.

Let us next take a short View of the _Teeth_[ff], In which their
peculiar Hardness[gg] is remarkable, their Growth[hh] also, their firm
Insertion and Bandage in the Gums and Jaws, and their various Shape and
Strength, suited to their various Occasion and Use[ii]; the foremost
weak and farthest from the Center, as being only Preparers to the rest;
the others being to grind and mince, are accordingly made stronger,
and placed nearer the Center of Motion and Strength. Likewise their
various Form[kk], in various Animals is considerable, being all curiously
adapted to the peculiar Food[ll], and Occasions of the several Species
of Animals[mm]. And lastly, the temporary Defect of them[nn], is no less
observable in Children, and such young Creatures, where there is no
Occasion for them; but they would be rather an Annoyance to the tender
Nipples and Breasts.

From the Teeth, the grand Instruments of Mastication; let us proceed
to the other ministerial Parts. And here the _Parotid_, _Sublingual_,
and _maxillary Glands_; together with those of the Cheeks and Lips, are
considerable; all lodged in the most convenient Places about the Mouth
and Throat to afford that noble digestive salival Liquor, to be mixed
with the Food in Mastication, and to moisten and lubricate the Passages,
to give an easie descent to the Food. The commodious Form also of the
Jaws, deserves our Notice; together with the strong Articulation of
the lowermost, and its Motion. And lastly, the curious Form, the great
Strength, the convenient Lodgment and Situation of the several Muscles
and Tendons[oo], all ministring to this so necessary an Act of Life, as
Mastication is; they are such Contrivances, such Works, as plainly set
forth the infinite Workman’s Care and Skill.

Next to the Mouth, the _Gullet_ presenteth it self; in every Creature
well-siz’d to the Food it hath occasion to swallow; in some but narrow,
in others as large and extensive[pp]; in all exceedingly remarkable for
the curious Mechanism of its Muscles, and the artificial Decussation and
Position of their Fibres[qq].

And now we are arriv’d to the grand Receptacle of the Food, the
_Stomach_; for the most Part as various as the Food to be convey’d
therein. And here I might describe the admirable Mechanism of its
Tunicks, Muscles, Glands, the Nerves, Arteries and Veins[rr]; all
manifesting the super-eminent Contrivance and Art of the infinite
Workman[ss]; they being all nicely adjusted to their respective Place,
Occasion and Service. I might also insist upon that most necessary
Office of _Digestion_; and here consider that wonderful Faculty of the
Stomachs of all Creatures, to dissolve[tt] all the several Sorts of Food
appropriated to their Species; even sometimes Things of that Consistency
as seem insoluble[uu]; especially by such seemingly simple and weak
_Menstruums_ as we find in their Stomachs: But I shall only give these
Things a bare mention, and take more peculiar Notice of the Special
Provision made in the particular Species of Animals, for the Digestion of
that special Food appointed them.

And in the first Place it is observable, that, in every Species of
Animals, the Strength and Size of their Stomach[ww] is conformable to
their Food. Such whose Food is more delicate, tender, and nutritive, have
commonly this Part thinner, weaker, and less bulky; whereas such whose
Aliment is less nutritive, or whose Bodies require larger Supplies to
answer their Bulk, their Labours, and waste of Strength and Spirits, in
them it is large and strong.

Another very remarkable Thing in this Part, is, the Number of Ventricles
in divers Creatures. In many but one; in some two or more[xx]. In such as
make a sufficient Comminution of the Food in the Mouth, one suffices. But
where Teeth are wanting, and the Food dry and hard, (as in granivorous
Birds,) there the Defect is abundantly supply’d by one thin membranaceous
Ventricle, to receive and moisten the Food, and another thick, strong,
muscular one, to grind and tear[yy] it. But in such Birds, and other
Creatures, whose Food is not Grain, but Flesh, Fruits, Insects, or
partly one, partly the other, there their Stomachs are accordingly
conformable to their Food[zz], stronger or weaker, membranaceous or
muscular.

But as remarkable a Thing, as any in this Part of Animals, is, the
curious Contrivance and Fabrick of the several Ventricles of ruminating
Creatures. The very Act it self of _Rumination_, is an excellent
Provision for the compleat Mastication of the Food, at the Resting,
leisure Times of the Animal. But the Apparatus for this Service, of
divers Ventricles for its various Uses and Purposes, together with their
curious Mechanism, deserves great Admiration[aaa].

Having thus far pursu’d the Food to the Place, where by its Reduction
into Chyle, it becomes a proper Aliment for the Body; I might next trace
it through the several Meanders of the _Guts_, the _Lacteals_, and so
into the _Blood_[bbb], and afterwards into the very Habit of the Body:
I might also take Notice of the Separation made in the _Intestines_, of
what is nutritive, (which is received,) and what is feculent, (being
ejected;) and the Impregnations there from the _Pancreas_ and the
_Gall_; and after it hath been strained through those curious Colanders,
the _lacteal Veins_, I might also observe its Impregnations from the
_Glands_ and _Lymphæducts_; and, to name no more, I might farther view
the exquisite Structure of the Parts ministring to all these delicate
Offices of Nature; particularly the artificial Conformation of the
Intestines might deserve a special Enquiry, their Tunicks, Glands, Fibres
traversing one another[ccc], and peristaltick Motion in all Creatures;
and their cochleous Passage[ddd] to retard the Motion of the Chyle, and
to make amends for the Shortness of the Intestines, in such Creatures who
have but one Gut; together with many other Accommodations of Nature in
particular Animals that might be mention’d. But it shall suffice to have
given only a general Hint of those curious and admirable Works of God.
From whence it is abundantly manifest how little weight there is in the
former atheistical Objection. Which will receive a further Confutation
from the

VI. and last Thing relating to Food, that I shall speak of, namely, _The
great Sagacity of all Animals, in finding out and providing their Food._
In Man perhaps we may not find any Thing very admirable, or remarkable in
this Kind, by Means of his Reason and Understanding, and his Supremacy
over the inferior Creatures; which answereth all his Occasions relating
to this Business: But then even here the Creator hath shewed his Skill,
in not over-doing the Matter; in not providing Man with an unnecessary
Apparatus, to effect over and over again what is feasible, by the Reach
of his Understanding, and the Power of his Authority.

But for the inferior Creatures, who want Reason, the Power of that
natural Instinct, that Sagacity[eee] which the Creator hath imprinted
upon them, do amply compensate that Defect. And here we shall find a
glorious Scene of the divine Wisdom, Power, Providence and Care, if
we view the various Instincts of Beasts, great and small, or Birds,
Insects and Reptiles[fff]. For among every Species of them, we may find
notable Acts of Sagacity, or Instinct, proportional to their Occasions
for Food. Even among those whose Food is near at Hand, and easily come
at; as Grass and Herbs; and consequently have no great need of Art to
discover it; yet, that Faculty of their accurate Smell and Taste, so
ready at every turn, to distinguish between what is salutary, and what
pernicious[ggg], doth justly deserve Praise. But for such Animals, whose
Food is not so easily come at, a Variety of wonderful Instinct may be
met with, sufficient to entertain the most curious Observer. With what
entertaining Power, and Artifice do some Creatures hunt[hhh], and pursue
their Game and Prey! And others watch and way-lay theirs[iii]! With what
prodigious Sagacity do others grope for it under Ground, out of Sight,
in moorish Places, in Mud and Dirt[kkk]; and others dig and delve for it,
both above[lll], and under the Surface of the drier Lands[mmm]! And how
curious and well designed a Provision is it of particular large Nerves in
such Creatures, adapted to that especial Service!

What an admirable Faculty is that of many Animals, to discover their
Prey at vast Distances; some by their Smell some Miles off[nnn]; and
some by their sharp and piercing Sight, aloft in the Air, or at other
great Distances[ooo]! An Instance of the latter of which GOD himself
giveth, (_Job_ xxxix. 27, 28, 29.) in the Instinct of the _Eagle_:
_Doth the Eagle mount up at thy Command, and make her Nest on high? She
dwelleth and abideth on the Rock, upon the Crag of the Rock, and the
strong Place[ppp]. From thence she seeketh her Prey, and her Eyes behold
afar off._ What a commodious Provision hath the Contriver of Nature made
for Animals, that are necessitated to climb for their Food; not only
in the Structure of their Legs and Feet, and in the Strength of their
Tendons and Muscles, acting in that particular Office[qqq]; but also in
the peculiar Structure of the principal Parts, acting in the Acquest of
their Food[rrr]! What a Provision also is that in nocturnal Birds and
Beasts, in the peculiar Structure of their Eye[sss], (and we may perhaps
add the Accuracy of their Smell too) whereby they are enabled to discover
their Food in the Dark? But among all the Instances we have of natural
Instinct, those Instincts, and especial Provisions made to supply the
Necessities of Helpless Animals, do in a particular Manner demonstrate
the great Creator’s Care. Of which I shall give two Instances.

1. The Provision made for young Creatures. That Στοργὴ, that natural
Affection, so connatural to all, or most Creatures towards their
Young[ttt], what an admirable noble Principle is it, implanted in them
by the wise Creator? By Means of which, with what Alacrity do they
transact their parental Ministry? With what Care do they nurse up their
Young; think no Pains too great to be taken for them, no Dangers[uuu] too
great to be ventured upon for their Guard and Security? How carefully
will they lead them about in Places of Safety, carry them into Places
of Retreat and Security; yea, some of them admit them into their own
Bowels[www]? How will they caress them with their affectionate Notes,
lull and quiet them with their tender parental Voice, put Food into their
Mouths, suckle them, cherish and keep them warm, teach them to pick, and
eat, and gather Food for themselves; and, in a word, perform the whole
Part of so many Nurses, deputed by the Sovereign Lord and Preserver of
the World, to help such young and shiftless Creatures, till they are come
to that Maturity, as to be able to shift for themselves?

And as for other Animals (particularly Insects, whose Sire is partly
the Sun, and whose numerous Off-spring would be too great for their
Parent-Animal’s Care and Provision) these are so generated, as to need
none of their Care, by Reason they arrive immediately to their Ἡλικία,
their perfect, adult State, and are able to shift for themselves. But
yet, thus far their parental Instinct (equivalent to the most rational
Care and Fore-sight) doth extend, that the old ones do not wildly drop
their Eggs and Sperm any where, at all Adventures, but so cautiously
reposit it in such commodious Places (some in the Waters, some on Flesh,
some on Plants proper and agreeable to their Species[xxx]; and some shut
up agreeable Food in their Nests, partly for Incubation, partly for
Food[yyy],) that their young in their _Aurelia_, or _Nympha_ State, may
find sufficient and agreeable Food to bring them up, till they arrive to
their Maturity.

Thus far the Parental Instinct and Care.

Next we may observe no less in the young themselves, especially in those
of the irrational Animals. Forasmuch as the Parent-Animal is not able to
bear them about, to cloath them, and to dandle them, as Man doth; how
admirably hath the Creator contrived their State, that those poor young
Creatures can soon walk about, and with the little Helps of their Dam,
shift for, and help themselves? How naturally do they hunt for their
Teat, suck, pick[zzz], and take in their proper Food?

But for the young of Man, their Parents Reason, joined with natural
Affection, being sufficient to help, to nurse, to feed, and to cloath
them; therefore they are born helpless, and are more absolutely than
other Creatures, cast upon their Parents Care[aaaa]. A manifest Act and
Designation of the Divine Providence.

2. The other Instance I promised, is the Provision made for the
Preservation of such Animals as are sometimes destitute of Food, or in
Danger of being so. The Winter is a very inconvenient, improper Season,
to afford either Food or Exercise to Insects, and many other Animals.
When the flowry Fields are divested of their Gaiety; when the fertile
Trees and Plants are stripp’d of their Fruits, and the Air, instead of
being warmed with the cherishing Beams of the Sun, is chilled with rigid
Frost; what would become of such Animals as are impatient of Cold? What
Food could be found by such as are subsisted by the Summer-Fruits? But
to obviate all this Evil, to stave off the Destruction and Extirpation
of divers Species of Animals, the infinitely wise Preserver of the World
hath as wisely ordered the matter; that, in the first Place, such as are
impatient of Cold, should have such a special Structure of their Body,
particularly of their Hearts, and Circulation of their Blood[bbbb],
as during that Season, not to suffer any waste of their Body, and
consequently not to need any Recruits; but that they should be able to
live in a kind of sleepy, middle State, in their Places of safe Retreat,
until the warm Sun revives both them and their Food together.

The next Provision is for such as can bear the Cold, but would want
Food then; and that is in some by a long Patience of Hunger[cccc], in
others by their notable Instinct in laying up Food beforehand against
the approaching Winter[dddd]. Of this many entertaining Examples may
be given; particularly we may, at the proper Season, observe not only
the little Treasures and Holes well-stocked with timely Provisions, but
large Fields[eeee] here and there throughout bespread with considerable
Numbers of the Fruits of the neighbouring Trees, laid carefully up in
the Earth, and covered safe, by the provident little Animals inhabiting
thereabouts. And not without Pleasure have I seen and admired the
Sagacity of other Animals, hunting out those subterraneous Fruits, and
pillaging the Treasures of those little provident Creatures.

And now from this bare transient View of this Branch of the Great
Creator’s Providence and Government, relating to the _Food_ of his
Creatures, we can conclude no less, than that since this grand Affair
hath such manifest Strokes of admirable and wise Management, that since
this is demonstrated throughout all Ages and Places, that therefore it is
God’s Handy-Work. For how is it possible that so vast a World of Animals
should be supported, such a great Variety equally and well supplied with
proper Food, in every Place fit for Habitation, without an especial
Superintendency and Management, equal to, at least, that of the most
prudent Steward and Housholder? How should the Creatures be able to find
out their Food when laid up in secret Places? And how should they be able
to gather even a great deal of the common Food, and at last to macerate
and digest it, without peculiar Organs adapted to the Service? And what
less than an infinitely Wise God could form such a Set of curious Organs,
as we find every Species endowed with, for this very Life? Organs so
artificially made, so exquisitely fitted up, that the more strictly we
survey them, the more accurately we view them (even the meanest of them
with our blest Glasses) the less Fault we find in them, and the more
we admire them: Whereas the best polished, and most exquisite Works,
made by human Art, appear through our Glasses, as rude and bungling,
deformed and monstrous; and yet we admire them, and call them Works of
Art and Reason. And lastly, What less than Rational and Wise could endow
irrational Animals with various Instincts, equivalent, in their special
Way, to Reason it self? Insomuch that some from thence have absolutely
concluded, that those Creatures had some Glimmerings of Reason. But
it is manifestly Instinct, not Reason they act by, because we find no
varying, but that every Species doth naturally pursue at all Times the
same Methods and Way, without any Tutorage or Learning: Whereas _Reason_,
without Instruction, would often vary, and do that by many Methods, which
_Instinct_ doth by one alone. But of this more hereafter.

[l] Among the many noble Contrivances for Food, I cannot but attribute
that universal Aliment, _Bread_, to the Revelation, or at least the
Inspiration of the Creator and Conservator of Mankind; not only because
it is a Food used in all, or most Parts of the World; but especially
because it is of incomparable Use in the great Work of Digestion, greatly
assisting the Ferment, or whatever causes the Digestion of the Stomach.
Of which take this Example from the noble Mr. _Boyle_. “He extracted a
_Menstruum_ from Bread alone, that would work on Bodies more Compact
than many hard Minerals, nay even on Glass it self, and do many Things
that _Aqua-fortis_ could not do——Yet by no means was this so corrosive
a Liquor as _Aq. fort._ or as the other _acid Menstruum_”. _Vid._ the
ingenious and learned Dr. _Harris_’s _Lex. Tech. verbo Menstruum_, where
the way of preparing it may be met with.

[n] The Insects that for the most part discolour the Waters, are the
small Insects of the _Shrimp-kind_, called by _Swammerdam_, _Pulex
aquaticus arborescens_. These I have often seen so numerous in stagnating
Waters in the Summer-Months, that they have changed the Colour of the
Waters to a pale or deep Red, sometimes a Yellow, according to the Colour
they were of. Of this _Swammerdam_ hath a pretty Story told him by Dr.
_Florence Schuyl_, viz. _Se aliquando Studiis intentum, magno quodam &
horrifico rumore fuisse turbatum, & simul ad causam ejus inquirendam
excitatum; verùm se vix eum in finem surrexisse, cùm Ancilla ejus pœne
exanimis adcurreret, & multo cum singultu referret, omnem Lugduni
~[Batavorum]~ aquam esse mutatam in sanguinem_. The Cause of which,
upon Examination he found to be only from the numerous Swarms of those
_Pulices_. V. Swamm. Hist. Insect. p. 70.

The Cause of this great Concourse, and Appearance of those little
Insects, I have frequently observed to be to perform their Coït; which
is commonly about the latter end of _May_, and in _June_. At that Time
they are very venereous, frisking and catching at one another; and many
of them conjoined Tail to Tail, with their Bellies inclined one towards
another.

At this Time also they change their Skin or _Slough_; which I conceive
their rubbing against one another mightily promoteth. And what if at this
Time they change their Quarters? _Vid._ _Book VIII. Chap. 4. Note (f)._

These small Insects, as they are very numerous, so are Food to many
Water-Animals. I have seen not only _Ducks_ shovel them up as they swim
along the Waters, but divers Insects also devour them, particularly some
of the middle-sized _Squillæ aquaticæ_, which are very voracious Insects.

[o] Besides the _Pulices_ last mentioned, there are in the Waters other
Animalcules very numerous, which are scarce visible without a Microscope.
In _May_, and the Summer Months, the green Scum on the top of stagnating
Waters, is nothing else but prodigious Numbers of these Animalcules: So
is likewise the green Colour in them, when all the Water seems green.
Which Animalcules, in all Probability, serve for Food to the _Pulices
Aquatici_, and other the minuter Animals of the Waters. Of which I gave
a pregnant Instance in one of the _Nymphæ_ of _Gnats_, to my Friend the
late admirable Mr. _Ray_, which he was pleased to publish in the last
Edition of his _Wisdom of God in the Creation_, p. 430.

And afterwards,

    _Propterea capitur Cibus, ut suffulciat artus,_
    _Et recreet vireis interdatus, atque patentem_

And after the same manner he discourseth of Thirst, and divers other
Things. _Vid._ _Lucret. l. 4. v. 831, &c._

Against this Opinion of the _Epicureans_, _Galen_ ingeniously argues in
his Discourse about the Hand. _Non enim Manus ipsæ_ (saith he) _hominem
artes docuerunt, sed Ratio. Manus autem ipsæ sunt artium organa; sicut
Lyra musici——Lyra musicam non docuit, sed est ipsius artifex per eam, quâ
præditus est, Rationem: agere autem non potest ex arte absque organis,
ita & una quælibet anima facultates quasdam à suâ ipsius substantiâ
obtinet,——Quòd autem corporis particulæ animam non impellunt,——manifeste
videre licet, si animalia recèns nata confideres, quæ quidem priùs agere
conantur, quàm perfectas habeant particulas. Ego namque Bovis vitulum
cornibus petere conantem sæpenumero vidi, antequam ei nata essent
cornua; Et pullum Equi calcitrantem, ~&c.~ Omne enim animal suæ ipsius
Animæ facultates, ac in quos usus partes suæ polleant maximè, nullo
doctore, præsentit.——Quâ igitur ratione dici potest, animalia partium
usus à partibus doceri, cùm & antequam illas habeant, hoc cognoscere
videantur? Si igitur Ova tria acceperis, unum Aquilæ, alterum Anatis,
reliquum Serpentis, & calore modico foveris, animaliaque excluseris; illa
quidem alis volare conantia, antequàm volare possint; hoc autem revolvi
videbis, & serpere affectans, quamvis molle adhuc & invalidam fuerit.
Et si, dum perfecta erunt, in unâ eâdemque domo nutriveris, deinde ad
locum subdialem ducta emiseris, Aquila quidem ad sublime; Anas autem in
paludem;——Serpens verò sub terrâ irrepet——Animalia quidem mihi videntur

[q] _Alia dentibus prædantur, alia unguibus, alia rostri aduncitate

Pedum ministerio, ut rapiant, distrahant, teneant, premant, pendeant,

[r] Because it would be tedious to reckon up the Bones, Glands, Muscles,
and other Parts belonging to the Mouth, it shall suffice to observe,
that, for the various Services of Man’s Mouth, besides the Muscles in
common with other Parts, there are five Pair, and one single one proper
to the Lips only, as Dr. _Gibson_ reckons them: But my most diligent
and curious Friend the late Mr. _Cowper_, discovered a sixth Pair. And
accordingly Dr. _Drake_ reckons six Pair, and one single one proper to
the Lips, _l. 3._ c. 13.

[s] _Galen_ deserves to be here consulted, who excellently argues against
the casual Concourse of the Atoms of _Epicurus_ and _Asclepiades_, from
the provident and wise Formation of the Mouths of Animals, and their
Teeth answerable thereto. In Man, his Mouth without a deep Incisure,
with only one canine Tooth on a side, and flat Nails, because, saith he,
_Hic Natura certò sciebat, se animal mansuetum ac civile effingere, cui
robur & vires essent ex sapientiâ, non ex corporis fortitudine_. But for
_Lions_, _Wolfs_ and _Dogs_, and all such as are called Καρχαρόδοντες,
(or having sharp, serrated Teeth) their Mouths are large, and deep cut;
Teeth strong and sharp, and their Nails sharp, large, strong and round,
accommodated to holding and tearing. _Vid._ _Galen. de Us. Part. l. 11.
c. 9._

[t] Among Insects the _Squillæ aquaticæ_, as they are very rapacious,
so are accordingly provided for it: Particularly the _Squilla aquatica
maxima recurva_ (as I call it) who hath somewhat terrible in its very
Aspect, and in its Posture in the Water, especially its Mouth, which is
armed with long, sharp Hooks, with which it boldly, and greedily catcheth
any thing in the Waters, even one’s Fingers. When they have seized their
Prey, they will so tenaciously hold it with their forcipated Mouth, that
they will not part therewith, even when they are taken out of the Waters,
and jumbled about in one’s Hand. I have admired at their peculiar way of
taking in their Food; which is done by piercing their Prey with their
_Forcipes_ (which are hollow) and sucking the Juice thereof through them.

The _Squilla_ here mentioned, is the first and second in _Mouffet_’s
_Theat. Insect. l. 2. c. 37._

[u] For an Instance of Insects endued with a Spear, I shall, for its
Peculiarity, pitch upon one of the smallest, if not the very smallest of
all the _Gnat_-kind, which I call, _Culex minimus nigricans maculatus
sanguisuga_. Among us in _Essex_, they are called _Nidiots_, by _Mouffet
Midges_. It is about ⅒ of an Inch, or somewhat more long, with short
_Antennæ_, plain in the Female, in the Male feather’d, somewhat like a
Bottle-Brush. It is spotted with blackish Spots, especially on the Wings,
which extend a little beyond the Body. It comes from a little slender
Eel-like Worm, of a dirty white Colour, swimming in stagnating Waters by
a wrigling Motion; as in _Fig. 5._

Its _Aurelia_ is small, with a black Head, little short Horns, a spotted,
slender, rough Belly, _Vid._ _Fig. 6._ It lies quietly on the top of the
Water, now and then gently wagging it self this way and that.

These _Gnats_ are greedy Blood-Suckers, and very troublesome, where
numerous, as they are in some Places near the _Thames_, particularly in
the Breach-Waters that have lately befallen near us, in the Parish of
_Dagenham_; where I found them so vexatious, that I was glad to get out
of those Marshes. Yea, I have seen Horses so stung with them, that they
have had Drops of Blood all over their Bodies, where they were wounded by
them.

I have given a Figure (in _Fig. 7._) and more particular Description of
the _Gnats_, because, although it be common, it is no where taken notice
of by any Author I know, except _Mouffet_, who, I suppose, means these
_Gnats_, which he calls _Midges_, _c. 13. p. 82._

[w] _Hornets_ and _Wasps_ have strong Jaws, toothed, wherewith they can
dig into Fruits, for their Food; as also gnaw and scrape Wood, whole
Mouthfuls of which they carry away to make their Combs. _Vid._ _infr._
_Chap. 13. Note (c)._

[x] _Monsieur de la Voye_ tells of an ancient Wall of Free-Stone in
the _Benedictines-Abby_ at _Caen_ in _Normandy_, so eaten with Worms,
that one may run ones Hand into most of the Cavities: That these Worms
are small and black, lodging in a greyish Shell, that they have large
flattish Heads, a large Mouth, with four black Jaws, _&c._ _Phil. Trans._
Nᵒ. 18.

[y] _Pro iis ~[Labris]~ cornea & acuta Volucribus Rostra. Eadem rapto
viventibus adunca: collecto, recta: herbas ruentibus limumque lata, ut
Suum generi. Jumentis vice manûs ad colligenda pabula: ora apertiora
laniatu viventibus._ Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 11. c. 37.

[z] _Parrots_ have their Bills nicely adapted to these Services, being
hooked, for climbing and reaching what they have occasion for; and the
lower Jaw being compleatly fitted to the Hooks of the upper, they can as
minutely break their Food, as other Animals do with their Teeth.

[aa] Thus in _Woodcocks_, _Snipes_, _&c._ who hunt for Worms in moorish
Ground, and, as Mr. _Willughby_ saith, live also on the fatty unctuous
Humour they suck out of the Earth. So also the Bills of _Curlews_, and
many other Sea-Fowl, are very long, to enable them to hunt for the Worms,
_&c._ in the Sands on the Sea-shore, which they frequent.

[bb] _Ducks_, _Geese_, and divers others, have such long broad Bills, to
quaffer and hunt in Water and Mud; to which we may reckon the uncouth
Bill of the _Spoon-Bill_: but that which deserves particular Observation
in the Birds named in these two last Notes is, the Nerves going to the
end of their Bills, enabling them to discover their Food out of Sight; of
which see _Book VII. Chap. 2. Note (e)._

[cc] The _Picus viridis_, or _Green-Woodspite_, and all the
_Wood-Peckers_ have Bills, curiously made for digging Wood, strong, hard,
and sharp. A neat Ridge runs along the top of the green _Wood-Pecker_’s
Bill, as if an Artist had designed it for Strength and Neatness.

[dd] The _Loxia_, or _Cross-Bill_, whose Bill is thick and strong,
with the Tips crossing one another; with great Readiness breaks open
Fir-cones, Apples, and other Fruit, to come at their Kernels, which are
its Food, as if the crossing of the Bill was designed for this Service.

[ee] The _Sea-Pie_ hath a long, sharp, narrow Bill, compressed side-ways,
and every way so well adapted to the raising _Limpets_ from the Rocks
(which are its chief, if not only Food) that Nature (or rather the Author
of Nature) seems to have framed it purely for that Use.

[ff] _Those animals which have Teeth on both Jaws, have but one Stomach;
but most of those which have no upper Teeth, or none at all, have three
Stomachs; as in Beasts, the Paunch, the Read, and the Feck; and in all
granivorous Birds, the Crop, the Echinus and the Gizard. For as chewing
is to an easie Digestion, so is swallowing whole to that which is more
laborious._ Dr. _Grew_’s Cosmol. Sacr. c. 5. §. 24.

[gg] _J. Peyer_ saith, the Teeth are made of convolved Skins hardened;
and if we view the Grinders of _Deer_, _Horses_, _Sheep_, _&c._ we shall
find great Reason to be of his Mind. His Observations are, _Mirum autem
eos ~(_i.e._ Dentes)~ cùm primùm è pelliculis imbricatim convolutis & muco
viscido constarent, in tantam dirigescere soliditatem, quæ ossa cuncta
superet. Idem fit etiam in Ossiculis Ceraforum, ~&c.~——Separatione factâ,
per membranas conditur Magma locellis, quos formant laminæ tenues,
ac duriusculæ ad Dentis figuram anteà divinitùs compositæ._ J. Peyer
Merycol. l. 2. c. 8.

[hh] _Qui autem ~(_i.e._ Dentes)~ renascuntur, minimè credendi sunt à
facultate aliquâ plasticâ Brutorum denuò formari, sed latentes tantummodo
in conspectum producuntur augmento molis ex effluente succo._ Id. ibid.

[ii] From these, and other like Considerations of the Teeth, _Galen_
infers, that they must needs be the Work of some wise, provident _Being_;
not _Chance_, nor a fortuitous Concourse of _Atoms_. For the Confirmation
of which he puts the Case, That suppose the order of the Teeth should
have been inverted, the _Grinders_ set in the room of the _Incisors_,
_&c._ (which might as well have been, had not the Teeth been placed by
a wise Agent) in this case, what Use would the Teeth have been of? What
Confusion by such a slight Error in their Disposal only? Upon which he
argues, _At siquis choream hominum 32_ (the Number of the Teeth) _ordine
disposuit, eum ut hominem industrium laudaremus; cùm verò Dentium choream
Natura tam bellè exornârit, nonne ipsam quoque laudabimus?_ And then
he goes on with the Argument, from the Sockets of the Teeth, and their
nice fitting in them, which being no less accurately done, than what is
done by a Carpenter, or Stone-Cutter, in fitting a Tenon into a Mortice,
doth as well infer the Art and Act of the wise _Maker_ of Animal Bodies,
as the other doth the Act and Art of Man. And so he goes on with other
Arguments to the same Effect. _Galen. de Us. Part. l. 11. c. 8._

[kk] A curious Account of this may be found in an _Extract of a Letter
concerning the Teeth of divers Animals_. Printed at _Paris_, in _M.
Vaugnion_’s Compleat Body of Chirurg. Oper. Chap. 53.

[ll] As it hath been taken notice of, that various Animals delight
in various Food; so it constantly falls out, that their Teeth are
accordingly fitted to their Food; the rapacious to catching, holding
and tearing their Prey; the herbaceous to Gathering and Comminution
of Vegetables: And such as have no Teeth, as Birds, their Bill, Craw
and Gizard, are assisted with Stones, to supply the defect of Teeth.
But the most considerable Example of this Kind is in some Families of
the Insect-Tribes, as the _Papilio-Kind_, _&c._ who have Teeth, and
are voracious, and live on tender Vegetables in their _Nympha_, or
_Caterpillar-State_, when they can only creep; but in their mature
_Papilio-State_, they have no Teeth, but a _Proboscis_, or _Trunk_ to
suck up Honey, _&c._ their Parts for gathering Food, as well as their
Food being changed, as soon as they have Wings to enable them to fly to
it.

[mm] It is remarkable in the Teeth of Fishes, that in some they are
sharp, as also jointed, so as to fall back, the better to catch and
hold their Prey, and to facilitate its Passage into the Stomach: So in
others they are broad and flat, made to break the Shells of Snails and
Shell-Fish devoured by them. These _Teeth_, or _Breakers_, are placed, in
some, in the Mouth; in some, in the Throat; and in _Lobsters_, _&c._ in
the Stomach it self; in the bottom of whose Stomachs are three of those
_Grinders_, with peculiar Muscles to move them.

[nn] What is there in the World can be called an Act of Providence and
Design, if this temporary Defect of Teeth be not such; that Children, for
Instance, should have none whilst they are not able to use them, but to
hurt themselves; or the Mother; and that at the very Age when they can
take in more substantial Food, and live without the Breast, and begin to
need Teeth, for the sake of Speech; that then, I say, their Teeth should
begin to appear, and gradually grow, as they more and more stand in need
of ’em.

[oo] It would be endless to particularize here, and therefore I shall
refer to the Anatomists; among the rest, particularly to _Galen_, for the
sake of his Descant upon this Subject. For having described the great
Accuracy of the Contrivance and Make of these Parts, he saith, _Haud
scio an hominum sit sobriorum ad Fortunam opificem id revocare: alioqui
quid tandem erit, quod cum Providentiâ atque Arte efficitur? Omnino enim
hoc ei contrariaum esse debet, quod casu ac fortuitè fit._ Galen. de Us.

[pp] _The Bore of the Gullet is not in all Creatures alike answerable
to the Body or Stomach. As in the ~Fox~, which both feeds on Bones, and
swallows whole, or with little chewing; add next in a ~Dog~, and other
ossivorous Quadrupeds, ’tis very large, ~viz.~ to prevent a Contusion
therein. Next in a ~Horse~, which though he feeds on Grass, yet swallows
much at once, and so requires a more open Passage. But in a ~Sheep~,
~Rabbit~, or ~Ox~, which bite short, and swallow less at once, ’tis
smaller. But in a ~Squirrel~, still lesser, both because he eats fine,
and to keep him from disgorging his Meat upon his descending Leaps. And
so in ~Rats~ and ~Mice~, which often run along Walls with their Heads
downwards._ Dr. _Grew_’s Comp. Anat. of Stom. and Guts. _Chap. 5._

[qq] Of this see Dr. _Willis_’s _Pharm. Rat._ Part 1. Sect. 1. c. 2.
_Steno_ also, and _Peyer Mery_, l. 2.

The Description these give of the muscular Part of the Gullet, the late
ingenious and learned Dr. _Drake_ saith is very exact in Ruminants, but
not in Men. _In Men, this Coat ~(the second of the Gullet)~ consists
of two fleshy ~Lamellæ~, like two distinct Muscles. The outward being
compared of strait longitudinal Fibres.——The inner Order of Fibres
is annular, without any observable Angles.——The Use of this Coat,
and these Orders of Fibres is to promote Deglutition; of which the
Longitudinal,——shorten the ~Oesophagus~, and so make its Capacity larger,
to admit of the Matter to be swallowed. The Annular, on the contrary,
contract the Capacity, and closing behind the descending Aliment, press
it downwards._ Drake’s Anat. vol. 1. l. 1. c. 9.

[rr] See _Willis_, ibid. _Cowper_’s _Anat. Tab. 35._ and many other
Authors.

to make a ~Menstruum~, that should corrode all sorts of Flesh coming into
the Stomach, and yet not the Stomach it self, which is also Flesh?_ Dr.
_Grew_’s Cosmol. Sacr. c. 4.

[uu] The Food of the _Castor_ being oftentimes, if not always, dry
Things, and hard of Digestion, such as the Roots and Bark of Trees,
’tis a wonderful Provision made in that Creature’s Stomach, by the
digestive Juice lodged in the curious little Cells there. A Description
of whose admirable Structure and Order may be found in _Blasius_ from
_Wepser_; concerning which he saith, _In quibus Mucus reconditus, non
secus ac Mel in Favis.——Nimiram quia Castoris alimentum exsuccum, & coctu
difficillimum est, sapientissimus & summè admirandus in suis operibus
rerum Conditor, D. O. M. ipsi pulcherrimâ istâ & affabrè factâ structurâ

& comminuendum alimentum durum & asperum par foret._ Vid. Blas. Anat.
Animal. c. 10. _Confer etiam Act. Erud. Lips._ Ann. 1684. p. 360.

Most of our modern Anatomists and Physicians attribute Digestion to
a dissolving _Menstruum_; but Dr. _Drake_ takes it to be rather from
fermentative, dissolving Principles in the Aliment it self, with the
Concurrence of the Air and Heat of the Body; as in Dr. _Papin_’s
_Digester_. _Vid._ _Dr. Anat. vol. 1. c. 14._

[ww] _All carnivorous Quadrupeds have the smallest Ventricles, Flesh
going farthest. Those that feed on Fruits, and Roots, have them of a
middle Size. Yet the ~Mole~, because it feeds unclean, hath a very great
one. ~Sheep~ and ~Oxen~, which feed on Grass, have the greatest. Yet
the ~Horse~ (and for the same Reason the ~Coney~ and ~Hare~) though
Graminivorous, yet comparatively have but little ones. For that a
~Horse~ is made for Labour, and both this, and the ~Hare~, for quick
and continued Motion; for which, the most easie Respiration, and so the
freest Motion of the Diaphragme is very requisite; which yet could not
be, should the Stomach lie big and cumbersome upon it, as in ~Sheep~ and
~Oxen~ it doth_, Grew, ib. Chap. 6.

[xx] The _Dromedary_ hath four Stomachs, one whereof is peculiarly
endowed with about twenty Cavities, like Sacks, in all Probability for
the holding of Water. Concerning which, see _Book VI. Chap. 4. Note (a)._

[yy] To assist in which Office, they swallow small angular Stones, which
are to be met with in the Gizards of all granivorous Birds; but in the
Gizard of the _Iynx_, or _Wryneck_, which was full only of _Ants_, I
found not one Stone. So in that of the _Green Wood-Pecker_ (full of
_Ants_ and _Tree-maggots_) there were but few Stones.

[zz] _In most carnivorous Birds, the third Ventricle is Membranous; where
the Meat is concocted, as in a Man: Or somewhat Tendinous, as in an
~Owl~; as if it were made indifferently for Flesh, or other Meat, as he
could meet with either. Or most thick and tendinous, called the Gizard;
wherein the Meat, as in a Mill, is ground to Pieces._ Grew, _ubi supra_,
Chap. 9.

[aaa] It would be much too long a Task to insist upon it here as it
deserves, and therefore concerning the whole Business of Rumination,
I shall refer to _J. Conr. Peyeri Merycolog. seu de Ruminantibus &
Ruminatione Commentar._ where he largely treateth of the several
Ruminating Animals, of the Parts ministring to this Act, and the great
Use and Benefit thereof unto them.

[bbb] There are too many Particulars to be insisted on, observable in the
Passages of the _Chyle_, from the Guts to the _Left Subclavian Vein_,
where it enters into the Blood; and therefore I shall only, for a Sample
of this admirable Oeconomy, take notice of some of the main and more
general Matters. And,

1. After the Food is become Chyle, and gotten into the Guts, it is an
excellent Provision made, not only for its Passage through the Guts, but
also for its Protrusion into the _Lacteals_, by the _Peristaltick_ Motion
and _Valvulæ conniventes_ of the Guts. 2. It is an admirable Provision,
that the Mouths of the _Lacteals_, and indeed the _Lacteals primi
generis_ themselves are small and fine, not wider than the _Capillary
Arteries_ are, lest by admitting Particles of the Nourishment grosser
than the _Capillaries_, dangerous Obstructions might be thereby produced.
3. After the Reception of the Aliment into the _Lacteals primi generis_,
it is a noble Provision for the Advancement of its Motion, that in the
_Mesenterick Glands_, it meets with some of the _Lymphæ-Ducts_, and
receives the Impregnations of the _Lympha_. And passing on from thence,
it is no less Advantage. 4. That the _Lacteals_, and _Lymphæ-Ducts_
meet in the _Receptaculum Chyli_, where the Aliment meeting with more
of the _Lympha_, is made of a due Consistence, and Temperament, for its
farther Advancement through the _Thoracick Duct_, and so into the _Left
Subclavian Vein_ and Blood. Lastly, This _Thoracick Duct_ it self is a
Part of great Consideration. For (as Mr. _Cowper_ saith) _If we consider
in this Duct its several Divisions and Inosculations, its numerous Valves
looking from below upwards, its advantagious Situation between the great
Artery and ~Vertebræ~ of the Back, together with the Ducts discharging
their refluent ~Lympha~ from the Lungs, and other neighbouring Parts,
we shall find all conduce to demonstrate the utmost Art of Nature used
in furthering the steep and perpendicular Ascent of the Chyle._ Anat.
Introduct.

[ccc] These, although noble Contrivances and Works of God, are too
many to be insisted on, and therefore I shall refer to the Anatomists,
particularly Dr. _Willis_ _Pharmaceut._ Dr. _Cole_, in _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ.

[ddd] In the _Thornback_, and some other Fishes, it is a very curious
Provision that is made to supply the Paucity and Brevity of the Guts; by
the Perforation of their single Gut, going not strait along, but round
like a Pair of Winding Stairs; so that their Gut, which seems to be but
a few Inches long, hath really a Bore of many Inches. But of these, and
many other noble Curiosities and Discoveries in Anatomy, the Reader will,
I hope, have a better and larger Account from the curious and ingenious
Dr. _Dowglas_, who is labouring in those Matters.

[fff] Among Reptiles that have a strange Faculty to shift for Food, _&c._
may be reckoned _Eels_, which, although belonging to the Waters, can
creep on the Land from Pond to Pond, _&c._ Mr. _Mosely_ of _Mosely_, saw
them creep over the Meadows, like so many Snakes from Ditch to Ditch;
which he thought, was not only for bettering their Habitation, but also
to catch Snails in the Grass. _Plot_’s _Hist. of Staffordshire_, c. 7. §.
32.

And as early as the Year 1125, the Frost was so very intense, that the
_Eels_ were forced to leave the Waters, and were frozen to Death in the
Meadows. _Vid._ _Hakewill_’s _Apol_. _l. 2. Chap. 7. S. 2._

[hhh] It would be endless to give Instances of my own and others
Observations of the prodigious Sagacity of divers Animals in Hunting,
particularly Hounds, Setting-Dogs, _&c._ one therefore shall suffice
of Mr. _Boyl_’s, viz. _A Person of Quality——to make a Trial, whether a
young Blood-Hound was well instructed,——caused one of his Servants——to
walk to a Town four Miles off, and then to a Market-Town three Miles from
thence.——The Dog, without seeing the Man he was to pursue, followed him
by the Scent to the abovementioned Places, notwithstanding the Multitude
of Market-People that went along in the same Way, and of Travellers that
had occasion to cross it. And when the Blood-Hound came to the chief
Market-Town, he passed through the Streets, without taking notice of any
of the People there, and left not till he had gone to the House, where
the Man he sought rested himself, and found him in an upper Room, to the
wonder of those that followed him._ Boyl. Determ. Nat. of Effluv. Chap. 4.

[iii] There are many Stories told of the Craft of the _Fox_, to compass
his Prey; of which _Ol. Magnus_ hath many such, as, feigning the barking
of a _Dog_, to catch Prey near Houses; feigning himself dead, to catch
such Animals as come to feed upon him; laying his Tail on a Wasp-Nest,
and then rubbing it hard against a Tree, and then eating the _Wasps_
so killed: Ridding himself of _Fleas_, by gradually going into Water,
with a Lock of Wool in his Mouth, and so driving the _Fleas_ up into
it, and then leaving it in the Water; By catching _Crab_-Fish with his
Tail, which he saith he himself was an Eye-Witness of; _Vidi & ego in
Scopulis Norvegia Vulpem, inter rupes immissâ caudâ in aquas, plures
educere Cancros, ac demum devorare._ Ol. Mag. Hist. l. 18. c. 39, 40.
But _Pliny_’s fabulous Story of the _Hyæna_ out-does these Relations of
the _Fox_, _Sermonem humanum inter pastorum stabula assimulare, nomenque
alicujus addiscere, quem evocatum foràs laceret. Item Vomitionem hominis
imitari ad sollicitandos Canes quos invadat._ Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 8. c.
30.

[kkk] This do _Ducks_, _Woodcocks_, and many other Fowls, which seek
their Food in dirty, moorish Places. For which Service they have very
remarkable Nerves reaching to the end of their Bills. Of which see _Book
VII. Chap. 2. Note (e)._

[lll] _Swine_, and other Animals that dig, have their Noses made more
tendinous, callous, and strong for this Service, than others that do not
dig. They are also edged with a proper, tough Border, for penetrating and
lifting up the Earth; and their Nostrils are placed well, and their Smell
is very accurate, to discover whatsoever they pursue by digging.

[mmm] The _Mole_, as its Habitation is different from that of other
Animals, so hath its Organs in every respect curiously adapted to that
way of Life; particularly its Nose made sharp, and slender, but withal
tendinous and strong, _&c._ But what is very remarkable, it hath such
Nerves reaching to the end of its Nose and Lips, as _Ducks_, _&c_. have,
mentioned above in _Note (kkk)._ Which Pair of Nerves I observed to be
much larger in this Animal than any other Nerves proceeding out of its
Brain.

[nnn] Predacious Creatures, as _Wolfs_, _Foxes_, _&c._ will discover Prey
at great Distances; so will _Dogs_ and _Ravens_ discover Carrion a great
way off by their Smell. And if (as the Superstitious imagine) the latter
flying over and haunting Houses be a sign of Death, it is no doubt from
some cadaverous Smell, those Ravens discover in the Air by their accurate
Smell, which is emitted from those diseased Bodies, which have in them
the Principles of a speedy Death.

[ooo] Thus _Hawks_ and _Kites_ on Land, and _Gulls_ and other Birds that
prey upon the Waters, can at a great Height in the Air see _Mice_, little
Birds and Insects on the Earth, and small Fishes, _Shrimps_, _&c._ in the
Waters, which they will dart down upon, and take.

[rrr] _The Contrivance of the Legs, Feet and Nails [of the ~Opossum]~
seems very advantagious to this Animal in climbing Trees (which it doth
very nimbly) for preying upon Birds._ But that which is most singular
in this Animal, is the Structure of its Tail, to enable it to hang on
Boughs. _The Spines, or Hooks——in the middle of the under side of the
~Vertebræ~ of the Tail; are a wonderful Piece of Nature’s Mechanism. The
first three ~Vertebræ~ had none of these Spines, but in all the rest they
were to be observed.——They were placed just at the Articulation of each
Joynt, and in the middle from the Sides.——For the performing this Office
~[of hanging by the Tail]~ nothing, I think, could be more advantagiously
contrived. For when the Tail is twirled or wound about a Stick, this Hook
of the ~Spinæ~ easily sustains the Weight, and there is but little labour
of the Muscles required, only enough for bowing or crooking the Tail._

_Oposs._ in _Phil. Trans._ No. 239.

[ttt] _Quid dicam quantus amor bestiarum sit in educandis custodiendisque
iis, qua procreaverint, usque ad eum finem, dum possint seipsa
defendere?_ And having instanced in some Animals, where this Care is not
necessary, and accordingly is not employed, he goes on, _Jam Gallinæ,
avesque reliquæ, & quietum requirunt ad pariendum locum, & cubilia sibi,
nidosque construunt, eosque quàm possunt mollissimè substernunt, ut quàm
facillime ova serventur. Ex quibus pullos cùm excluserint, ita tuentur,
ut & pennis foveant, ne frigore lædantur, & si est calor, à sole se
opponant._ Cic. de Nat. Deor. l. 2. c. 51, 52.

To this natural Care of Parent-Animals to their young, we may add the
Returns made by the young of some towards the old ones. _Pliny_ saith
of _Rats_, _Genitores suos fesses senectâ, alunt insigni pietate._ Nat.
Hist. l. 8. c. 57. So _Cranes_, he saith, _Genitricum senectam invicem
educant._ L. 10. c. 23.

This St. _Ambrose_ takes Notice of in his _Hexameron_, and _Ol. Magnus_
after him, _Depositi patris artus, per longævum senectutis plumis
nudatos circumstans soboles pennis propriis fovet,——collatitio cibo
pascit, quando etiam ipsa naturæ reparat dispendia, ut hinc inde senem
sublevantes, fulcro alarum suarum ad volandum exerceant, & in pristinos
usus desueta membra reducant._ For which Reason this Bird is denominated
_Pia. Vid. Ol. Mag. Hist. l. 19. c. 14._

Hereto may be added also the conjugal Στοργὴ of the little green
_Æthiopian Parrot_, which Mr. _Ray_ describes from _Clusius_. _Fœmellea
senescentes (quod valdè notabile) vix edere volebant, nisi cibum jam à
mare carptum, & aliquandiu in prolobo retentum, & quasi coctum rostro suo
exciperent, ut Columbarum pulli à matre ali solent._ Synops. Meth. Av. p.

[uuu] The most timid Animals, that at other Times abscond, or hastily
fly from the Face of Man, Dogs, _&c._ will, for the sake of their young,
expose themselves. Thus among Fowls, _Hens_ will assault, instead of fly
from such as meddle with their Brood. So _Partridges_, before their young
can fly, will drop frequently down, first at lesser, and then at greater
Distances, to dodge and draw off Dogs from pursuing their young.

[www] The _Opossum_ hath a curious Bag on purpose for the securing and
carrying about her young. There are belonging to this Bag two Bones (not
to be met with in any other Skeleton) and four Pair of Muscles; and
some say Teats lie therein also. Dr. _Tyson_, _Anat._ of the _Oposs._
in _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 239. where he also, from _Oppian_, mentions the
_Dog-Fish_, that upon any Storm or Danger, receives the young Ones into
her Belly, which come out again when the Fright is over. So also the
_Squatina_ and _Glaucus_, the same Author saith, have the same Care for
their young, but receive them into different Receptacles.

[xxx] See _Book VIII. Chap. 6._

[yyy] See _Chap. 13. Note (c)._

[zzz] There is manifestly a superintending Providence in this Case, that
some Animals are able to suck as soon as ever they are born, and that
they will naturally hunt for the Teat before they are quite gotten out
of the Secundines, and parted from the Navel-String, as I have seen. But
for _Chickens_, and other young Birds, they not being able immediately
to pick till they are stronger, have a notable Provision made for such
a Time, by a part of the Yolk of the Egg being inclosed in their Belly,
a little before their Exclusion or Hatching, which serves for their
Nourishment, till they are grown strong enough to pick up Meat. _Vid._

To the long Abstinence mentioned of Brute-Animals, I hope the Reader
will excuse me if I add one or two Instances of extraordinary Abstinence
among Men. One _Martha Taylor_, born in _Derbyshire_, by a Blow on the
Back fell into such a Prostration of Appetite, that she took little
Sustenance, but some Drops with a Feather, from _Christmas 1667._
for thirteen Months, and slept but little too all the Time. See Dr.
_Sampson_’s Account thereof in _Ephem. Germ. T. 3. Obs. 173._

To this we may add the Case of _S. Chilton_, of _Tinsbury_, near _Bath_,
who in the Years 1693, 1696, and 97, slept divers Weeks together. And
although he would sometimes, in a very odd manner, take Sustenance, yet
would lie a long Time without any, or with very little, and all without
any considerable Decay. See _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 304.

[dddd] They are admirable Instincts which the _Sieur de Beauplan_
relates of his own Knowledge, of the little Animals called _Bohaques_ in
_Ukraine_. _They make Burroughs like ~Rabbets~, and in ~October~ shut
themselves up, and do not come out again till ~April~.——They spend all
the Winter under Ground, eating what they laid up in Summer.——Those that
are lazy among them, they lay on their Backs, then lay a great handful
of dry Herbage upon their Bodies, ~&c.~ then others drag those Drones to
the Mouths of their Burroughs, and so those Creatures serve instead of
Barrows, ~&c.~ I have often seen them practise this, and have had the
Curiosity to observe them whole Days together.——Their Holes are parted
like Chambers; some serve for Store-Houses, others for Burying-Places,
~&c.~ Their Government is nothing inferior to that of ~Bees~, ~&c.~ They
never go abroad without posting a Centinel upon some high Ground, to give
notice to the others whilst they are feeding. As soon as the Centinel
sees any Body, it stands upon his Hind-Legs and whistles._ Beauplan’s

[eeee] I have in _Autumn_, not without Pleasure observed, not only the
great Sagacity and Diligence of _Swine_, in hunting out the Stores of the
_Field-Mice_; but the wonderful Precaution also of those little Animals,
in hiding their Food beforehand against Winter. In the Time of Acorns
falling, I have, by means of the _Hogs_, discovered, that the Mice had,
all over the neighbouring fields, treasured up single Acorns in little
Holes they had scratched, and in which they had carefully covered up the
Acorn. These the _Hogs_ would, Day after Day, hunt out by their Smell.




CHAP. XII.

_Of the Cloathing of Animals._


Having in the foregoing Chapter somewhat largely taken a view of the
Infinite Creator’s Wisdom and Goodness towards his Creatures, in ordering
their Food, I shall be more brief in this Chapters in my View of their
_Cloathing_[a]; another necessary Appendage of Life, and in which
we have plain Tokens of the Creator’s Art, manifested in these two
Particulars; the _Suitableness of Animals Cloathing to their Place and
Occasions_; and the _Garniture and Beauty thereof_.

I. The Cloathing of Animals is suited to their Place of Abode, and
Occasions there; a manifest Act of Design and Skill. For if there was
a Possibility, that Animals could have been accoutred any other Way,
than by God that made them, it must needs have come to pass, that their
Cloathing would have been at all Adventures, or all made the same Mode
and Way, or some of it, at least, inconvenient and unsuitable. But on the
contrary, we find all is curious and compleat, nothing too much, nothing
too little, nothing bungling, nothing but what will bear the Scrutiny of
the most exquisite Artist; yea, and so far out-do his best Skill, that
his most exquisite Imitations, even of the meanest Hair, Feather, Scale,
or Shell, will be found only as so many ugly, ill-made Blunders and
Botches, when strictly brought to the Test of good Glasses. But we shall
find an Example remarkable enough in the present Case, if we only compare
the best of Cloathing which Man makes for himself, with that given by the
Creator for the Covering of the irrational Creatures. Of which it may be
said, as our _Saviour_ doth of the Flowers of the Field, _Mat_. vi. 29.
_That even Solomon, in all his Glory, was not arrayed like one of these._

But let us come to Particulars, and consider the Suitableness of the
different Method the Creator hath taken in the Cloathing of Man, and of
the irrational Animals. This _Pliny_[b] pathetically laments, and says,
_It is hard to judge, whether Nature hath been a kinder Parent, or more
cruel Step-Mother to Man._ For, says he, _Of all Creatures, he alone is
covered with other’s Riches, whereas Nature hath given various Cloathing
to other Animals, Shells, Hides, Prickles, Shag, Bristles, Hair, Down,
Quills, Scales, Fleeces; and Trees she hath fenced with a Bark or two
against the Injuries of Cold and Heat. Only poor naked Man_, says he, _is
in the Day of his Birth cast into the wide World, to immediate crying and
squalling; and none of all Creatures besides, so soon to Tears in the
very beginning of their Life._

But here we have a manifest Demonstration of the Care and Wisdom of God
towards his Creatures; that such should come into the World with their
Bodies ready furnished and accommodated, who had neither Reason nor
Forecast to contrive, nor Parts adapted to the Artifices and Workmanship
of Cloathing; but for Man, he being endowed with the transcending Faculty
of Reason, and thereby made able to help himself, by having Thoughts
to contrive, and withal Hands to effect, and sufficient Materials[c]
afforded him from the Skins and Fleeces of Animals, and from various
Trees and Plants: Man, I say, having all this Provision made for him,
therefore the Creator hath wisely made him naked, and left him to shift
for himself, being so well able to help himself.

And a notable Act this is of the Wisdom of God, not only as the more
setting forth his Care and Kindness to them that most needed his Help,
the helpless irrational Animals, and in his not over-doing his Work; but
also as it is most agreeable to the Nature and State of Man[d], both on
natural and political Accounts. That Man should cloath himself is most
agreeable to his Nature, particularly (among other Things,) as being
most salutary, and most suitable to his Affairs. For by this Means, Man
can adapt his Cloathing to all Seasons, to all Climates, to this, or to
any Business. He can hereby keep himself sweet and clean, fence off many
Injuries; but above all, by this Method of Cloathing, with the natural
Texture of his Skin adapted to it, it is that grand Means of Health,
namely, _insensible Perspiration_[e] is perform’d, at least greatly
promoted, without which an human Body would be soon over-run with Disease.

In the next Place, there are good political Reasons for Man’s cloathing
himself, inasmuch as his Industry is hereby employ’d in the Exercises
of his Art and Ingenuity; his Diligence and Care are exerted in keeping
himself sweet, cleanly, and neat; many Callings and Ways of Life arise
from thence, and, (to name no more,) the Ranks and Degrees of Men are
hereby in some Measure render’d visible to others, in the several Nations
of the Earth.

Thus it is manifestly best for Man that he should cloath himself.

But for the poor shiftless Irrationals, it is a prodigious Act of the
great Creator’s Indulgence, that they are all ready furnished with such
Cloathing, as is proper to their Place and Business[f]. Some covered
with Hair[g], some with Feathers[h], some with Scales, some with
Shells[i], some only Skin, and some with firm and stout Armature; all
nicely accommodated to the Element in which the Creature liveth, and
its occasions there[k]. To _Quadrupeds_ Hair is a commodious Cloathing;
which, together with the apt Texture of their Skin, fitteth them for
all Weathers, to lie on the Ground, and to do the Offices of Man; and
the thick and warm Furs and Fleeces of others, are not only a good
Defensative against the Cold and Wet; but also a soft Bed to repose
themselves in; and to many of them, a comfortable covering, to nurse and
cherish their tender Young.

And as Hair to Quadrupeds; so Feathers are as commodious a Dress to such
as fly in the Air, to Birds, and some Insects; not only a good Guard
against Wet and Cold, and a comfortable Covering to such as hatch and
brood their Young; but also most commodious for their Flight. To which
purpose they are nicely and neatly placed every where on the Body, to
give them an easie Passage through the Air[l], and to assist in the
wafting their Body through that thin Medium. For which Service, how
curious is their Texture for Lightness, and withal for Strength? Hollow
and thin for Lightness, but withal, context and firm for Strength. And
where ’tis necessary they should be filled, what a light and strong
medullary Substance is it they are filled with? By which curious
Contrivances, even the very heaviest Parts made for Strength, are so
far from being a Load to the Body, that they rather assist in making
it light and buoyant, and capacitate it for Flight. But for the Vanes,
the lightest part of the Feather, how curiously are they wrought with
capillary Filaments, neatly interwoven together[m], whereby they are
not only light, but also sufficiently close and strong, to keep the
Body warm, and guard it against the Injuries of Weather, and withal, to
impower the Wings, like so many Sails, to make strong Impulses upon the
Air in their Flight[n]. Thus curious, thus artificial, thus commodious
is the Cloathing of Beasts and Birds: Concerning which, more in proper
Place.

And no less might I shew that of Reptiles and Fishes[o] to be, if it was
convenient to enlarge upon this Branch of the Creator’s Works. How well
adapted are the _Annuli_ of some Reptiles, and the Contortions of the
Skin of others, not only to fence the Body sufficiently against outward
Injuries; but to enable them to creep, to perforate the Earth[p], and in
a word, to perform all the Offices of their Reptile State, much better
than any other Tegument of the Body would do? And the same might be said
of the Covering of the Inhabitants of the Waters, particularly the Shells
of some, which are a strong Guard to the tender Body that is within, and
consistent enough with their slower Motion; and the Scales and Skins of
others, affording them an easie and swift Passage through the Waters.
But it may be sufficient to give only a Hint of these Things, which more
properly belong to another Place.

Thus hath the indulgent Creator furnish’d the whole animal World with
convenient, suitable Cloathing.

II. Let us in the next Place take a short View of the _Garniture_[q],
and _Beauty_ thereof. And here we shall thus far, at least, descry it to
be beautiful; that it is compleat and workman-like. Even the Cloathing
of the most sordid Animals, those that are the least beautified with
Colours, or rather whose Cloathing may regrate the Eye[r]; yet when we
come strictly to view them, and seriously consider the nice Mechanism of
one Part, the admirable Texture of another, and the exact Symmetry of the
Whole; we discern such Strokes of inimitable Skill, such incomparable
Curiosity, that we may say with _Solomon_, Eccl. iii. 11. [God] _hath
made every Thing beautiful in his Time_.

But for a farther Demonstration, of the super-eminent Dexterity of his
almighty Hand, he hath been pleas’d, as it were on Purpose, to give
surprizing Beauties to divers Kinds of Animals. What radiant Colours are
many of them, particularly some Birds and Insects[s], bedeck’d with!
What a prodigious Combination is there often of these, yea, how nice
an Air frequently of meaner Colours[t], as to captivate the Eye of all
Beholders, and exceed the Dexterity of the most exquisite Pencil to copy?

And now, when we thus find a whole World of Animals, cloathed in the
wisest Manner, the most suitable to the Element in which they live,
the Place in which they reside, and their State and Occasions there;
when those that are able to shift for themselves, are left to their own
Discretion and Diligence, but the Helpless well accouter’d and provided
for; when such incomparable Strokes of Art and Workmanship appear in all,
and such inimitable Glories and Beauties in the Cloathing of others;
who can, without the greatest Obstinacy and Prejudice, deny this to be
_GOD_’s Handy-work? The gaudy, or even the meanest Apparel which Man
provideth for himself, we readily enough own to be the Contrivance, the
Work of Man: And shall we deny the Cloathing of all the Animal World
betides (which infinitely surpasseth all the Robes of earthly Majesty;
shall we, dare we, deny that) to be the Work of any Thing less than of
an infinite, intelligent Being, whose Art and Power are equal to such
glorious Work!

To this Guard against the Cold, namely, of Fire and Cloathing; I hope
the Reader will excuse me, if I take this Opportunity of adding some
other Defensatives Nature, (or rather the great Author of Nature,)
hath afforded these northern Regions: Such are their high Mountains,
abounding, as _Ol. Magnus_ saith, through all Parts; also their numerous
Woods, which besides their Fire, do, with the Mountains, serve as
excellent Screens against the Cold, piercing Air and Winds. Their
prodigious Quantities of Minerals, and Metals, also afford Heat, and warm
Vapours, _Mineræ septentrionalium regionum satìs multæ, magnæ, diversæ,
& opulentæ sunt_, saith the same curious, and (for his Time,) learned
Archbishop, _l. 6. c. 1._ and in other Places. And for the Warmth they
afford, the _Volcano_’s of those Parts are in Evidence; as are also their
terrible Thunder and Lightning, which are observ’d to be the most severe
and mischievous in their metalline Mountains, in which large Herds of
Cattle are sometimes destroy’d; the Rocks so rent and shatter’d, that new
Veins of Silver are thereby discover’d; and a troublesome Kind of Quinsie
is produc’d in their Throats, by the stench, and poisonous Nature of
the sulphureous Vapours, which they dissolve, by drinking warm Beer and
Butter together, as _Olaus_ tells us in the same Book, _Chap. 11._

To all which Defensatives, I shall, in the last Place add, the warm
Vapours of their Lakes, (some of which are prodigiously large, of 130
_Italian_ Miles in Length, and not much less in Breadth;) also of their
Rivers, especially the Vapours which arise from the Sea. Of which Guard
against severe Cold, we have lately had a convincing Proof in the _great
Frost_, in 1708, wherein, when _England_, _Germany_, _France_, _Denmark_;
yea, the more southerly Regions of _Italy_, _Switzerland_, and other
Parts suffer’d severely, _Ireland_ and _Scotland_ felt very little of
it, hardly more than in other Winters; of the Particulars of which,
having given an Account in the _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 324. I shall thither
refer the Reader. But it seems this is what doth ordinarily befal those
northern Parts; particularly the _Islands_ of _Orkney_, of which the
learned Dr. _Wallace_ gives this Account: _Here the Winters are generally
more subject to Rain than Snow; nor doth the Frost and Snow continue so
long here, as in other Parts of ~Scotland~; but the Wind in the mean
Time will often blow very boisterously; and it Rains sometimes, not by
Drops, but by spouts of Water, as if whole Clouds fell down at once. In
the Year 1680, in the Month of ~June~, after great Thunder, there fell
Flakes of Ice near a Foot thick._ _Wall._ Account of _Ork._ Chap. 1. _p.
4._ From which last Passage I observe; That although in those Parts, the
Atmosphere near the Earth be warm, it is excessively cold above; so as to
freeze some of those Spouts of Water in their Descent, into such great,
and almost incredible Masses of Hail. And whence can this Warmth proceed,
but from the Earth, or Sea, emitting Heat sufficient to stave off the
Cold above? Consult _Book II. Chap. 5. Note (c)._

[e] Concerning _insensible Perspiration_, _Sanctorius_ observes, That it
much exceeds all the Sensible put together. _De Stat. Med. Aph. 4._ That
as much is evacuated by _insensible Perspiration_ in one Day, as is by
_Stool_ in fourteen Days. Particularly, that, in a Night’s Time, about
sixteen Ounces is commonly sent out by _Urine_, four Ounces by Stool; but
above forty Ounces by _insensible Perspiration_, Aphor. 59, 60. That if a
Man eats and drinks 8 _l._ in a Day, 5 _l._ of it is spent in _insensible
Perspiration_, §. 1. Aph. 6. And as to the Times, he saith, _Ab assumpto
cibo 5 horis 1 l. circiter perspirabilis——exhalare solet, à 5a ad 12am 3
l. circiter; à 12a ad 16am vix selibram_, Aph. 56.

And as to the wonderful Benefits of _insensible Perspiration_, they are
abundantly demonstrated by the same learned Person, _ubi supra_; as also
by _Borelli_ in his second Part, _De Mot. Animal_, Prop. 168. who saith,
_Necessaria est insensibilis Transpiratio, ut vita Animalis conservetur._

[g] From _Malpighi_’s curious Observations of the _Hair_, I shall
note three Things. 1. Their Structure is fistulous, or tubular; which
hath long been a Doubt among the curious. _Fistulosum ~[esse Pilum]~
demonstrant lustratio pilarum à caudâ & collo Equorum, ~&c.~——præcipuè
setarum Apri, quæ patentiorem ex fistulis compositionem exhibent. Est
autem dictus Apri pilus Cylindricum corpus quasi diaphanum——fistularum
aggere conflatum, & speciem columnæ striatæ præ se fert. Componentes
fistulæ in gyrum situatæ in apice patentiores redduntur; nam hians pilus
in geminas dividitur partes, & componentes minimæ fistulæ——libersores
redditæ manifestantur, ita ut enumerari possunt; has autem 20, & ultra
numeravi.——Expositæ fistulæ——tubulosæ sunt, & frequentibus tunicis
transversaliter situatis, veluti valvulis pollent. Et quoniam Spinæ, in
Erinaceis præcipui, ~&c.~ nil aliud sunt, quam duri & rigidi pili, ideo,
~&c.~_ And then he describes the _Hedgehog_’s Spines, in which those
Tubes manifestly appear; together, with medullary Valves and Cells; not
inelegant, which he hath figur’d in _Tab. 16._ at the End of his Works.

That which this sagacious, and not enough to be commended Observer, took
notice of in the Structure of Hair, and its Parity to the Spines; I have
my self observ’d in some Measure to be true, in the Hair of _Cats_,
_Rats_, _Mice_, and divers other Animals; which look very prettily
when view’d with a good Microscope. The Hair of a _Mouse_, (the most
transparent of any I have view’d,) seems to be one single transparent
Tube, with a Pith made up of a fibrous Substance, running in dark Lines;
in some Hairs tranversly, in others spirally, as in _Fig. 14, 15, 16,
17._ These darker medullary Parts, or Lines, I have observ’d, are no
other than small Fibres convolved round, and lying closer together than
in other Parts of the Hair. They run from the Bottom, to the Top of
the Hair; and I imagine, serve to the gentle Evacuation of some Humour
out of the Body; perhaps the Hair serves as well for the _insensible
Perspiration_ of hairy Animals, as to fence against Cold and Wet. In
_Fig. 14, 16_, is represented the Hair of a _Mouse_, as it appears
through a small Magnifier; and in _Fig. 15, 17_, as it appears when
view’d with a larger Magnifier.

Upon another Review, I imagine, That although in _Fig. 14, 15_, the dark
Parts of the Pith seem to be transverse; that they, as well as in the two
other Figures, run round in a screw-like Fashion.

[i] See _Chap. XIV. Note (c)._

[k] It is a Sign some wise Artist was a Contriver of the Cloathing of
Animals; not only as their Cloathing varies, as their Way of Living doth;
but also because every Part of their Bodies is furnish’d with proper
suitable Cloathing. Thus divers Animals, that have their Bodies cover’d
for the most Part with short, smooth Hair; have some Parts left naked,
where Hair would be an Annoyance: And some Parts beset with long Hair;
as the Mane and Tail; And some with stiff, strong Bristles; as about the
Nose; And sometimes within the Nostrils; to guard off, or give warning of
Annoyances.

[l] The Feathers being placed from the Head towards the Tail, in close
and neat Order, and withal preened and dressed by the Contents of the
Oil-Bag, afford as easie a Passage through the Air, as a Boat new cleaned
and dressed finds in its Passage through the Waters. Whereas, were the
Feathers placed the contrary, or any other way (as they would have been,
had they been placed by Chance, or without Art) they would then have
gathered Air, and been a great Encumbrance to the Passage of the Body
through the Air. See _Book VII. Chap. 1. Note (b)._

[m] In _Book VII. Chap. 1. Note (e)._ there is a particular Account of
the Mechanism of their Vanes, from some nice Microscopical Observations,
and therefore I shall take no farther Notice of it here.

[p] For a Sample of this Branch of my Survey, let us chuse the Tegument
of _Earth-Worms_, which we shall find compleatly adapted to their Way
or Life and Motion, being made in the most compleat Manner possible for
terebrating the Earth, and creeping where their Occasions lead them.
For their Body is made throughout of small Rings, and these Rings have
a curious _Apparatus_ of Muscles, enabling those Creatures with great
Strength to dilate, extend, or contract their _Annuli_, and whole Body;
those _Annuli_ also are each of them armed with small, stiff, sharp
_Beards_, or _Prickles_, which they can open, to lay hold on, or shut
up close to their Body: And lastly, Under the Skin there lies a _slimy
Juice_, that they emit, as Occasion is, at certain Perforations between
the _Annuli_, to lubricate the Body, and facilitate their Passage into
the Earth. By all which Means they are enabled with great Speed, Ease,
and Safety, to thrust and wedge themselves into the Earth; which they
could not do, had their Bodies been covered with Hair, Feathers, Scales,
or such like Cloathing of the other Creatures. See more concerning this
Animal, _Book IX. Chap. 1. Note (a)._

[q] _Aristotle_, in his _Hist. Anim. l. 3. c. 12._ names several Rivers,
that by being drank of, change the Colour of the Hair.

[r] For an Example; Let us take the Cloathing of the _Tortoise_ and
_Viper_; because, by an incurious View, it rather regrateth, than
pleaseth the Eye: But yet, by an accurate Survey, we find the Shells
of the Former, and the Scales of the Latter, to be a curious Piece of
Mechanism, neatly made; and so compleatly, and well put, and tack’d
together, as to exceed any human Composures: Of the Latter see more in
_Book IX. Chap. 1. Note (c)._

[s] It would be endless to enter into the Particulars of the beautiful
_Birds_ and _Insects_ of our _European_ Parts; but especially those
inhabiting the Countries between the Tropicks, which are observed as much
to exceed our Birds in their Colours, as ours do theirs in their Singing.

[t] The _Wryneck_, at a Distance, is a Bird of mean Colour; neither are
indeed its Colours radiant, or beautiful, singly considered: But when it
is in the Hand we see its light and darker Colours so curiously mixed
together, as to give the Bird a surprizing Beauty. The same is also
observable in many Insects, particularly of the _Phalæna kind_.




CHAP. XIII.

_Of the Houses and Habitation of Animals._


Having in the last Chapter, as briefly as well I could, surveyed the
_Cloathing_ of Animals, I shall in this take a View of their _Houses_,
_Nests_, their _Cells_ and _Habitations_; another Thing no less
necessary to their Well-being than the last; and in which the Great
Creator hath likewise signalized his Care and Skill, by giving Animals
an architectonick Faculty, to build themselves convenient Places of
Retirement, in which to repose and secure themselves, and to nurse up
their Young.

And here, as before, we may consider the case of Man, and that of the
irrational Animals. Man having (as I said) the Gift of Reason and
Understanding, is able to shift for himself, to contrive and build, as
his Pleasure leads him, and his Abilities will admit of. From the meanest
Huts and Cottages, he can erect himself stately Buildings, bedeck them
with exquisite Arts of Architecture, Painting, and other Garniture,
ennoble them, and render them delightful with pleasant Gardens,
Fountains, Avenues, and what not? For Man therefore the Creator hath
abundantly provided in this respect, by giving him an Ability to help
himself. And a wise Provision this is, inasmuch as it is an excellent
Exercise of the Wit, the Ingenuity, the Industry and Care of Man.

But since Ingenuity, without Materials, would be fruitless, the Materials
therefore which the Creator hath provided the World with, for this
very Service of Building, deserves our Notice. The great Varieties of
Trees[a], Earth, Stones and Plants, answering every Occasion and Purpose
of Man for this Use, in all Ages and Places all the World over, is a
great Act of the Creator’s Goodness; as manifesting, that since he has
left Man to shift for himself, it should not be without sufficient Help
to enable him to do so, if he would but make use of them, and the Sense
and Reason which God hath given him.

Thus sufficient Provision is made for the Habitation of Man.

And no less shall we find is made for the rest of the Creatures; who
although they want the Power of Reason to vary their Methods, and cannot
add to, or diminish from, or any way make Improvements upon their natural
Way; yet we find that natural Instinct, which the Creator’s infinite
Understanding hath imprinted in them, to be abundantly sufficient, nay,
in all Probability, the very best or only Method they can take, or that
can be invented for the respective Use and Purpose of each peculiar
Species of Animals[b]. If some Creatures make their Nests in Holes, some
in Trees, some in Shrubs, some in the Earth[c], some in Stone, some in
the Waters, some here, and some there, or have none at all; yet we find,
that that Place, that Method of Nidification doth abundantly answer the
Creatures Use and Occasions. They can there sufficiently and well repose,
and secure themselves, lay, and breed up their Young. We are so far from
discovering any Inconvenience in any of their respective Ways, from
perceiving any Loss befal the Species, any decay, any perishing of their
Young; that in all Probability, on the contrary, in that particular
Way they better thrive, are more secure, and better able to shift for,
and help themselves. If, for Instance, some Beasts make to themselves
no Habitation, but lie abroad in the open Air, and there produce their
Young; in this case we find there is no need it should be otherwise, by
Reason they are either taken care of by Man [d], or in no Danger, as
other Creatures, from Abroad. If others reposite their Young in Holes[e]
and Dens, and secure themselves also therein, it is, because such
Guard, such Security is wanting, their Lives being sought either by the
Hostility of Man, or to satisfie the Appetite of rapacious Creatures[f].
If among Birds, some build their Nests close, some open, some with this,
some with another Material, some in Holes, some in Trees, some on the
Ground[g], some on Rocks and Crags on high (of which God himself hath
given an Instance in the _Eagle_, Job xxxix. 27, 28.) And so among the
Insect and Reptile Kinds, if some reposite their Eggs or Young in the
Earth, some in Wood, some in Stone, some on one Kind of Plant, some on
another, some in warm and dry Places, some in the Water and moist Places,
and some in their own Bodies only, as shall be shewn in proper Place; in
all these Cases it is in all Probability, the best or only Method the
Animal can take for the Hatching and Production of its Young, for their
Supplies, Safety, or some other main Point of their Being or Well-being.
This is manifest enough in many Cases, and therefore probable in all.
It is manifest that such Animals, for Instance, as breed in the Waters
(as not only Fish, but divers Insects, and other Land-Animals do) that
their Young cannot be hatched, fed, or nursed up in any other Element. It
is manifest also, that Insects, which lay their Eggs on this, and that,
and the other agreeable Tree, or Plant, or in Flesh, _&c._ that it is
by that Means their Young are fed and nursed up. And it is little to be
doubted also, but that these Matrixes may much conduce to the Maturation
and Production of the Young. And so in all other the like Cases of
Nidification, of Heat or Cold, Wet or Dry, Exposed or Open, in all
Probability this is the best Method for the Animal’s Good, most salutary
and agreeable to its Nature, most for its Fecundity, and the Continuance
and Increase of its Species; to which every Species of Animals is
naturally prompt and inclined.

Thus admirable is the natural Sagacity and Instinct[h] of the irrational
Animals in the Convenience and Method of their Habitations. And no less
is it in the Fabrick of them. Their architectonick Skill, exerted in
the Curiosity and Dexterity of their Works, and exceeding the Skill of
Man to imitate; this, I say, deserves as much or more Admiration and
Praise, than that of the most exquisite Artist among Men. For with what
inimitable Art[i] do these poor untaught Creatures lay a parcel of rude
and ugly Sticks and Straws, Moss and Dirt together, and form them into
commodious Nests? With what Curiosity do they line them within, wind and
place every Hair, Feather, or Lock of Wool, to guard the tender Bodies of
themselves and their Young, and to keep them warm? And with what Art and
Craft do many of them thatch over, and coat their Nests without, to dodge
and deceive the Eye of Spectators, as well as to guard and fence against
the Injuries of Weather[k]? With what prodigious Subtilty do some
foreign Birds[l] not only plat and weave the fibrous Parts of Vegetables
together, and curiously tunnel them, and commodiously form them into
Nests, but also artificially suspend them on the tender Twigs of Trees,
to keep them out of the reach of rapacious Animals?

And so for _Insects_, those little, weak, those tender Creatures; yet,
what admirable Artists are they in this Business of Nidification! With
what great Diligence doth the little _Bee_ gather its Combs from various
Trees[m] and Flowers, the _Wasp_ from solid[n] Timber! And with what
prodigious geometrical Subtilty do those little Animals work their deep
hexagonal Cells, the only proper Figure that the best Mathematician could
chuse for such a Combination of Houses[o]! With what Accuracy do other
Insects perforate the Earth[p], Wood, yea, Stone it self[q]! For which
Service, the compleat Apparatus of their Mouths[r], and Feet[s], deserves
particular Observation, as hath been, and will be hereafter observ’d.
And further yet; With what Care and Neatness do most of those little
sagacious Animals line those their Houses within, and seal them up, and
fence them without[t]! How artificially will others fold up the Leaves of
Trees and Plants[u]; others house themselves in Sticks and Straws; others
glue light and floating Bodies together[w], and by that Artifice make
themselves floating Houses in the Waters, to transport themselves at
Pleasure after their Food, or other necessary Occasions of Life! And for
a Close, let us take the scriptural Instance of the _Spider_, Prov. xxx.
28. which is one of the four little Things, which, v. 44. _Agur_ says, is
_exceeding Wise: The Spider taketh hold with her Hands, and is in Kings
Palaces_[x]. I will not dispute the Truth of our _English_ Translation
of this Text, but supposing the Animal mention’d to be that which is
meant; it is manifest, that the Art of that Species of Creatures, in
spinning their various Webs, and the Furniture their Bodies afford to
that Purpose, are an excellent Instinct, and Provision of Nature, setting
forth its glorious Author.

And now from this short and transient View of the architectonick Faculty
of Animals, especially the Irrationals; we may easily perceive some
superiour and wise Being was certainly concern’d in their Creation or
Original. For, how is it possible that an irrational Creature should,
with ordinary and coarse, or indeed any Materials, be ever able to
perform such Works, as exceed even the Imitation of a rational Creature?
How could the Bodies of many of them, (particularly the last mention’d,)
be furnish’d with architective Materials? How could they ever discover
them to be in their Bodies, or know what Use to make of them? We must
therefore necessarily conclude, That the Irrationals either have Reason
and Judgment, not only Glimmerings thereof, but some of its superiour
Acts, as Wisdom and Foresight, Discretion, Art and Care; or else, that
they are only passive in the Case, and act by Instinct, or by the Reason
of some superiour Being imprinted in their Nature, or some Way or other,
(be it how it will,) congenial with them. That they are Rational, or
excel Man in Art and Wisdom, none surely will be so foolish as to say:
And therefore we must conclude, That those excellent Ends they pursue,
and that admirable Art they exert, is none of their own, but owing
to that infinitely wise and excellent Being, of whom it may be said,
with reference to the irrational, as well as rational Creatures, as it
is, _Prov_. ii. _6_. _The Lord giveth Wisdom; out of his Mouth cometh
Knowledge and Understanding._

[c] Many of the _Vespæ-Ichneumones_ are remarkable enough for their
Nidification and Provision for their Young. Those that build in Earth
(who commonly have golden and black Rings round their _Alvi_) having
lined the little Cells, they have perforated, lay therein their Eggs,
and then carry into them Maggots from the Leaves of Trees, and seal them
up close and neatly. And another _Ichneumon_, more of the _Vespa_ than
_Musca-Ichneumon_ Kind (having a little Sting in its Tail, of a black
Colour) gave me the Pleasure, one Summer, of seeing it build its Nest
in a little Hole in my Study-Window. This Cell was coated about with an
odoriferous, resinous Gum, collected, I suppose, from some Fir-Trees
near; after which it laid two Eggs (I think the Number was) and then
carried in divers Maggots, some bigger than it self. These it very
sagaciously sealed close up into the Nest, leaving them there doubtless,
partly to assist the Incubation; and especially for Food to the future
Young when hatched.

Of this Artifice of these _Ichneumons_, _Aristotle_ himself takes Notice,
(but I believe he was scarce aware of the Eggs sealed up with the
Spiders). Ὁι δὲ Σφῆκες Ιχνεύμονες καλούμενοι, &c. _As to the ~Vespæ~,
called ~Ichneumones~, (less than others) they kill ~Spiders~, and carry
them into their Holes, and having sealed them up with Dirt, they therein
hatch, and produce those of the same Kind._ Hist. Anim. l. 5. c. 20.

To what hath been said about these _Ichneumon Wasps_, I shall add one
Observation more, concerning the providential Structure of their Mouth in
every of their Tribes, _viz._ their Jaws are not only very strong, but
nicely sized, curved and placed for gnawing and scraping those compleat
little Holes they perforate in Earth, Wood, yea in Stone it self.

[d] _Tully_ having spoken of the Care of some Animals towards their
Young, by which they are nursed and brought up, saith, _Accedit etiam ad

& salutem, hominum etiam solertia & diligentia. Nam multæ & pecudes, &
stirpes sunt, quæ fine procuratione hominum salvæ esse non possunt._ Cic.

[g] It is a notable Instinct which _Ol. Magnus_ tells of the _Galli
Sylvestres_ in his Northern Country, to secure themselves against
the Cold and Storms of the Winter. _Cùm nives instar collium terræ
superficiem ubique cooperiunt, ramosque arborum diutiùs deprimunt &
condensant, certos fructus Betulæ arboris——in formâ longi Piperis
vorant, & glutiunt indigestos; idque tantâ aviditate, ac quantitate, ut
repletum guttur toto corpore majus appareat. Deinde partitis agminibus
sese inter medios nivium colles immergunt, præfortim in Jan. Febr.
Martio, quando nives ut turbines, typhones, vel tempestates gravissimæ

[h] It is a very odd Story (which I rather mention for the Reader’s
Diversion, than for its Truth) which Dr. _Lud. de Beaufort_ relates,

[i] Of the Subtilty of Birds in Nidification, see _Plin. Nat. Hist. l.
10. c. 33._

[k] Among many Instances that might be given of this Subtilty of birds,
and other Creatures, that of the _long-tailed Titmouse_ deserves
Observation, who with great Art builds her Nest with Mosses, Hair, and
the Webs of _Spiders_, cast out from them when they take their Flight
(see _Book VIII. Chap. 4. Note (e)_) with which the other Materials are
strongly tied together. Having neatly built, and covered her Nest with
these Materials without; she thatcheth it on the top with the _Muscus
arboreus ramosus_, or such like broad, whitish Moss, to keep out Rain,
and to dodge the Spectator’s Eye; and within she lineth it with a great
Number of soft Feathers; so many, that I confess I could not but admire
how so small a Room could hold them, especially that they could be laid
so close and handsomely together, to afford sufficient Room for a Bird
with so long a Tail, and so numerous an Issue as this Bird commonly hath,
which Mr. _Ray_ saith (_Synops. Method. Avium_, p. 74.) _Ova inter omnes
aviculas numerosissima ponit._ See more of the Nest of this Bird, from
_Aldrovand._ in _Willugh. Ornith._ p. 243.

[l] The Nest of the _Guira tangeima_, the _icterus minor_, and the
_Jupujuba_, or whatever other Name the _American Hang-Nests_ may be
called by, are of this Kind. Of which see _Willughby_’s _Ornith. Lib. 2.
Chap. 5. Sect. 12, 13._ Also Dr. _Grew_’s _Museum Reg. Soc. Part 1. Sect.
4. Chap. 4._ These Nests I have divers Times seen, particularly in great
Perfection in our _R. S._ Repository, and in the noble and well-furnished
_Museum_ of my often-commended Friend Sir _Hans Sloane_; and at the
same Time I could not but admire at the neat Mechanism of them, and the
Sagacity of the Bird, in hanging them on the Twigs of Trees, to secure
their Eggs and Young from the _Apes_.

[m] I mention Trees, because I have seen _Bees_ gather the Gum of
Fir-Trees, which at the same Time gave me the Pleasure of seeing their
way of loading their Thighs therewith; performed with great Art and
Dexterity.

[n] _Wasps_, at their first Coming, may be observ’d to frequent Posts,
Boards, and other Wood that is dry and sound; but never any that is
rotten. There they may be heard to scrape and gnaw; and what they so gnaw
off, they heap close together between their Chin and Fore-Legs, until
they have gotten enough for a Burden, which they then carry away in their
Mouths, to make their Cells with.

[o] Circular Cells would have been the most capacious; but this would
by no Means have been a convenient Figure, by Reason much of the Room
would have been taken up by Vacancies between the Circles; therefore
it was necessary to make Use of some of the rectilinear Figures. Among
which only three could be of Use; of which _Pappus Alexandrin_. thus
discourseth; _Cùm igitur tres figuræ sunt, quæ per seipsas locum circa
idem punctum consistentem replere possunt, Triangulum seil. Quadratum
& Hexagonum, Apes illam quæ ex pluribus angulis constat sapienter
delegerunt, utpote suspicantes eam plus mellis capere quàm utramvis
reliquarum. At Apes quidem illud tantùm quod ipsis utile est cognoscunt,
viz. Hexagonum Quadrato & Triangulo esse majus & plus Mellis capere
posse, nimirum æquali materiâ in constructionem uniuscujusque consumptâ.
Nos verò qui plus sapientiæ quàm Apes habere profitemur, aliquid etiam
magìs insigne investigabimus._ Collect. Math. l. 5.

[s] Among many Examples, the Legs and Feet of the _Mole-Cricket_,
(_Gryllotalpa_,) are very remarkable. The Fore-Legs are very brawny and
strong; and the Feet armed each with four flat strong Claws, together
with a small Lamina, with two larger Claws, and a third with two little
Claws: Which Lamina is joynted to the Bottom of the Foot, to be extended,
to make the Foot wider, or withdrawn within the Foot. These Feet are
placed to scratch somewhat sideways as well as downward, after the Manner
of _Moles_ Feet; and they are very like them also in Figure.

Somewhat of this Nature, _Swammerdam_ observes of the Worms of the
_Ephemeron_. _To this Purpose, ~[to dig their Cells,]~ the wise Creator
hath furnish’d them_, (saith he,) _with fit Members. For, besides that
their two Fore-Legs are formed somewhat like those of the ordinary
~Moles~, or ~Gryllotalpa~; he hath also furnish’d them with two toothy
Cheeks, somewhat like the Sheers of ~Lobsters~, which serve them more
readily to bore the Clay._ Swammerdam’s Ephem. Vit. Publish’d by Dr.
_Tyson_, Chap. 3.

[t] See the before-cited _Note (c)._

[u] They are for the most Part, some of the _Phalænæ_-Tribe, which
inhabit the tunnelled, convolved Leaves, that we meet with on Vegetables
in the Spring and Summer. And it is a somewhat wonderful Artifice, how
so small and weak a Creature, as one of those newly-hatch’d Maggots,
(for doubtless it is they, not the Parent-Animal, because she emits no
Web, nor hath any tectrine Art,) can be able to convolve the stubborn
Leaf, and then bind it in that neat round Form, with the Thread or Web
it weaves from its own Body; with which it commonly lines the convolved
Leaf, and stops up the two Ends, to prevent its own falling out; and
_Earwigs_, and other noxious Animals getting in.

[w] The several Sorts of _Phryganea_, or _Cadews_, in their _Nympha_, or
_Maggot-state_, thus house themselves; one Sort in Straws, call’d from
thence _Straw-Worms_; others in two or more Sticks, laid parallel to one
another, creeping at the Bottom of Brooks; others with a small Bundle of
Pieces of Rushes, Duck-weed, Sticks, _&c._ glu’d together, where-with
they float on the Top, and can row themselves therein about the Waters,
with the Help of their Feet: Both these are call’d _Cob-bait_. Divers
other Sorts there are, which the Reader _may_ see a Summary of, from
Mr _Willughby_, in _Raii Method. Insect._ p. 12. together with a good,
though very brief Description of the _Papilionaceous_ Fly, that comes
from the _Cod-bait Cadew_. It is a notable architectonick Faculty,
which all the Variety of these Animals have, to gather such Bodies as
are fittest for their Purpose, and then to glue them together; some to
be heavier than Water, that the Animal may remain at the Bottom, where
its Food is; (for which Purpose they use Stones, together with Sticks,
Rushes, _&c._) and some to be lighter than Water, to float on the Top,
and gather its Food from thence. These little Houses look coarse and shew
no great Artifice outwardly; but are well tunnelled, and made within with
a hard tough Paste; into which the hinder Part of the Maggot is so fix’d,
that it can draw its Cell after it any where, without Danger of leaving
it behind; as also thrust its Body out, to reach what it wanteth; or
withdraw it into its Cell, to guard it against Harms.

[x] Having mention’d the _Spider_, I shall take this Occasion, (although
it be out of the Way,) to give an Instance of the Poyson of some of them.
_Scaliger Exerc. 186. relates, That in ~Gascony~, his Country, there are
~Spiders~ of that virulency, that if a Man treads upon them, to crush
them, their Poyson will pass through the very Soles of his Shoe._ Boyl.
Subtil. of Effluv. c. 4.

Mr. _Leewenhoek_ put a _Frog_ and a _Spider_ together into a Glass, and
having made the _Spider_ sting the _Frog_ divers Times, the _Frog_ dy’d
in about an Hour’s Time. _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 272.

In the same _Transaction_, is a curious Account of the Manner how
_Spiders_ lay, and guard their eggs, _viz._ they emit them not out of the
hindermost Part of the Body, but under the upper Part of her Belly, near
the Hind-Legs, _&c._ Also there is an Account of the Parts from which
they emit their Webs, and divers other Things worth Observation, with
Cuts illustrating the Whole.

But in _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 22. Dr. _Nath. Fairfax_, from _S. Redi_, and
his own Observations, thinks _Spiders_ not venomous; several Persons, as
well as Birds, swallowing them without Hurt: Which I my self have known
in a Person of Learning, who was advis’d to take them medicinally at
first, and would at any Time swallow them, affirming them to be sweet,
and well tasted: And not only innocuous, but they are very salutiferous
too, in some of the most stubborn Diseases, if the pleasant Story in
_Mouffet_ be true; of a rich _London_ Matron, cur’d of a desperate
_Tympany_, by a certain Debauchee, that hearing of her Case, and that she
was given over by the Doctors, went to her, pretending to be a Physician,
and confidently affirming he would cure her; which she being willing to
believe, agrees with him for so much Money, one half to be paid down, the
other upon Cure. Upon which he gives her a _Spider_, promising her Cure
in three Days. Upon which, (not doubting but that he had poison’d her,
and fearing he might be call’d to account for it,) he gets out of Town
as fast as he could. But instead of being poison’d, she soon recover’d.
After some Months, the Quack gets privately to Town, when he thought the
Bustle might be over; and enquiring how his Patient did, was inform’d
of her Cure; and thereupon visiting her, and making an Excuse for his
Absence, he receiv’d his Pay with great Applause and Thanks. _Mouff.

Having said so much of _Spiders_, I might here add their Flight: But of
this, see _Book VIII. Chap. 4. Note (e)._




CHAP. XIV.

_Of Animals Self-Preservation._


Having thus consider’d the Food, Cloathing, and Houses of Animals; let us
in this Chapter take a Glance of another excellent Provision, the wise
Creator hath made for the Good of the animal World; and that is, the
Methods which all Animals naturally take for their _Self-Preservation_
and _Safety_. And here it is remarkable, (as in the Cases before,)
that _Man_, who is endow’d with Reason, is born without Armature, and
is destitute of many Powers, which irrational Creatures have in a much
higher Degree than he, by Reason he can make himself Arms to defend
himself, can contrive Methods for his own Guard and Safety, can many Ways
annoy his Enemy, and stave off the Harms of noxious Creatures.

But for others, who are destitute of this super-eminent Faculty; they are
some Way or other provided with sufficient Guard[a], proportionate to
their Place of Abode, the Dangers they are like to incur there[b]; and in
a Word, to their greatest Occasions, and Need of Security. Accordingly,
some are sufficiently guarded against all common Dangers, by their
natural Cloathing, by their Armature of Shells, or such like hard, and
impregnable Covering of their Body[c]. Others destitute of this Guard,
are armed, some with Horns[d], some with sharp Quills and Prickles[e],
some with Claws, some with Stings[f]; some can shift and change their
Colours[g]; some can make their Escape by the Help of their Wings, and
others by the Swiftness of their Feet; some can screen themselves by
diving in the Waters, others by tinging and disordering the Waters[h],
can make their Escape; and some can guard their Bodies, even in the very
Flames, by the Ejection of the Juice of their Bodies[i]; and some by
their accurate Smell, Sight or Hearing, can foresee Dangers[k]; others
by their natural Craft, can prevent or escape them[l]; others by their
Uncouth Noise[m]; by the horrid Aspect, and ugly Gesticulations of their
Body[n]; and some even by the Power of their Excrements, and their
Stink[o], can annoy their Enemy, and secure themselves; and against
some[p], the divine Providence it self hath provided a Guard.

By such Shifts and Means as these, a sufficient Guard is ministred to
every Species of Animals, in its proper respective Place; abundantly
enough to secure the Species from Destruction, and to keep up that
Balance, which I have formerly shew’d, is in the World among every, and
all the Species of Animals; but yet not enough to secure Individuals,
from becoming a Prey to Man, or to other Creatures, as their Necessities
of Life require. To which Purpose, the natural Sagacity and Craft of the
one intrapping[q], and captivating, being in some Measure equivalent to
that of the other in evading, is as excellent a Means for the maintaining
the one, as preserving the other; and if well consider’d, argues the
Contrivance of the infinitely wise Creator and Preserver of the World.

[c] Shells deserve a Place in this Survey, upon the Account of their
great Variety; the curious and uncouth Make of some, and the beautiful
Colours, and pretty Ornaments of others; but it would be endless to
descend to Particulars. Omitting others, I shall therefore only take
Notice of the _Tortoiseshell_, by Reason a great deal of Dexterity
appears, even in the Simplicity of that Animal’s Skeleton. For, besides
that the Shell is a stout Guard to the Body, and affords a safe Retreat
to the Head, Legs and Tail, which it withdraws within the Shell upon
any Danger; besides this, I say, the Shell supplieth the Place of all
the Bones in the Body, except those of the extreme Parts, the Head and
Neck, and the four Legs and Tail. So that at first Sight, it is somewhat
surprizing to see a compleat Skeleton consisting of so small a Number of
Bones, and they abundantly sufficient for the Creature’s Use.

[f] The _Sting_ of a _Wasp_, or _Bee_, &c. is so pretty a Piece of Work,
that it is worth taking Notice of, so far as I have not found others to
have spoken of it. Others have observ’d the Sting to be an hollow Tube,
with a Bag of sharp penetrating Juices, (its Poison,) joined to the End
of it, within the Body of the _Wasp_, which is, in Stinging, injected
into the Flesh through the Tube. But there are besides this, two small,
sharp, bearded Spears, lying within this Tube or Sting, as in a Sheath.
In a _Wasp_’s Sting, I counted eight Beards on the Side of each Spear,
somewhat like the Beards of Fish-hooks. These Spears in the Sting, or
Sheath, lie one with its Point a little before that of the other; as is
represented in _Fig. 21._ to be ready, (I conceive,) to be first darted
into the Flesh; which being once fix’d, by Means of its foremost Beard,
the other then strikes in too, and so they alternately pierce deeper and
deeper, their Beards taking more and more hold in the Flesh; after which
the Sheath or Sting follows, to convey the Poison into the Wound. Which,
that it may pierce the Better, it is drawn into a Point, with a small
Slit a little below that Point, for the two Spears to come out at. By
Means of this pretty Mechanism in the Sting, it is, that the Sting when
out of the Body, and parted from it, is able to pierce and sting us:
And by Means of the Beards being lodged deep in the Flesh, it comes to
pass that _Bees_ leave their Stings behind them, when they are disturbed
before they have Time to withdraw their Spears into their Scabbard. In
_Fig. 21._ is represented the two Spears as they lie in the Sting. In
_Fig. 22._ the two Spears are represented when squeez’d out of the Sting,
or the Scabbard; in which Latter, _Fig. A c b_, is the Sting, _c d_, and
_b e_, the two bearded Spears thrust out.

[g] The _Camelion_ is sufficiently fam’d on this Account. Besides which,
_Pliny_ tells us of a Beast as big as an _Ox_, called the _Tarandus_,
that when he pleaseth, assumes the Colour of an _Ass_, and _Colorem
omnium fruticum, arborum, florum, locorumgue reddit, in quibus latet
metuens, ideoque rarò capitur._ Plin. l. 8. c. 34.

How true this is, there may be some Reason to doubt; but if any Truth
be in the Story, it may be from the Animal’s chusing such Company,
or Places, as are agreeable to its Colour: As I have seen in divers
_Caterpillars_, and other Insects, who I believe were not able to change
their Colour, from one Colour to another; yet I have constantly observ’d,
do fix themselves to such Things as are of the same Colour; by which
Means they dodge the Spectator’s Eye. Thus the _Caterpillar_ that feeds
on _Elder_, I have more than once seen, so cunningly adhering to the
small Branches of the same Colour, that it might be easily mistaken for
a small Stick, even by a careful View. So a large green _Caterpillar_,
that feeds on _Buckthorn_, and divers others. To which I may add the
prodigious Sagacity of the _Ichneumon Flies_, that make the _Kermes_,
(for of that Tribe all the _Kermes_ I ever saw was;) how artificially
they not only inclose their Eggs within that gummy Skin, or Shell; but
also so well humour the Colour of the Wood they adhere to, by various
Streaks and Colours, that it is not easie to distinguish them from the
Wood it self.

re-kindled, and by this Means sav’d it self from the Force of the Fire

Nests, or touching the Bird; daring no more to venture my Hand into their
Holes, than if a Serpent had lodged in it.

CHAP. XV.

_Of the Generation of Animals._


There remains now only one Thing more of the ten Things in common
to Animals, and that is what relates to their Generation[a], and
Conservation of their Species[b], by that Means. It would not be
seemly to advance far in this admirable Work of God; neither shall I
at all insist upon that of Man for the same Reason. And as for the
Irrationals[c], I shall confine my self to these five Matters.

I. Their natural Sagacity in chusing the fittest Places to reposite their
Eggs and Young.

II. The fittest Times and Seasons they make use of for their Generation.

III. The due and stated Number of their Young.

IV. Their Diligence and earnest Concern in their Breeding up.

V. Their Faculty of Feeding them, and their Art and Sagacity exerted
therein.

I. The natural Sagacity of irrational Animals, in chusing the fittest
Places to reposite their Eggs and Young. Of this I have given larger
Hints already than I needed to have done, when I spake of the
Architecture[d] of Animals, intending then to have wholly pass’d by this
Business of Generation; I shall therefore now only superadd a few other
Instances, the more to illustrate this Matter.

It hath been already shewn, and will hereafter[e] farther appear, that
the Places in which the several Species of Animals lay up their Eggs,
and Young, are the best for that Purpose; Waters[f] for one; Flesh
for another; Holes in Wood[g], Earth, or Stone[h], for others; and
Nests for others; and we shall find, that so ardent is the Propensity
of all Animals, even of the meanest Insects, to get a fit Place for
the Propagation of their Young; that, as will hereafter appear, there
is scarce any Thing that escapeth the Inquest of those little subtile
Creatures. But besides all this, there are two or three Things more
observable, which plainly argue the Instinct of some superior rational
Being. As,

1. The compleat and neat Order which many Creatures observe in laying up
their Seed, or Eggs, in proper Repositories: Of which I shall speak in
another Place[i].

2. The suitable Apparatus in every Creature’s Body, for the laying-up its
Eggs, Seed, or Young, in their proper Place. It would be as endless as
needless to name all Particulars, and therefore an Instance or two of the
Insect-Tribe may serve for a Specimen in this Place, till I come to other
Particulars. Thus Insects, who have neither Feet adapted to scratch, nor
Noses to dig, nor can make artificial Nests to lay up their Young; yet
what abundant Amends is there made them, in the Power they have either to
extend the _Abdomen_[k], and thereby reach the commodious Places they
could not otherwise come at; or else they have some aculeous Part or
Instrument to terebrate, and make Way for their Eggs into the Root[l],
Trunk[m], Fruit[n], Leaves[o], and the tender Buds of Vegetables[p], or
some other such curious and secure Method they are never destitute of. To
which we may add,

3. The natural Poison[q], (or what can I call it?) which many or most of
the Creatures, last intended, have, to cause the Germination of such
Balls, Cases, and other commodious Repositories, as are an admirable
Lodgment to the Eggs and Young; that particularly in the Incubation and
Hatching the Young, and then afford them sufficient Food and Nourishment
in all their _Nympha-State_, in which they need Food; and are afterwards
commodious Houses and Beds for them in their _Aurelia-State_, till they
are able to break Prison, fly abroad, and shift for themselves. But this
shall be taken Notice of, when I come to treat of Insects.

II. As irrational Animals chuse the fittest Place, so also the fittest
Times and Seasons for their Generation. Some indeed are indifferent
to all Times, but others make use of peculiar Seasons[r]. Those, for
Instance, whose Provisions are ready at all Seasons, or who are under
the Tuition of Man, produce their Young without any great regard to Heat
or Cold, Wet or Dry, Summer or Winter. But others, whose Provisions
are peculiar, and only to be met with at certain Seasons of the Year,
or who, by their Migration and Change of Place, are tied up to certain
Seasons; these (as if endowed with a natural Care and Foresight of what
shall happen) do accordingly lay, hatch and nurse up their Young in the
most proper Seasons of all the Year for their Purpose; as in Spring,
or Summer, the Times of Plenty of Provisions, the Times of Warmth for
Incubation, and the most proper Seasons to breed up their Young, till
they are able to shift for themselves, and can range about for Food, and
seek Places of Retreat and Safety, by flying long Flights as well as
their Progenitors, and passing into far distant Regions, which (when
others fail) afford those helpless Creatures the Necessaries of Life.

III. To the special Seasons, I may add the peculiar Number of Young
produced by the irrational Creatures. Of which I have already taken some
Notice, when I spake of the Balance of Animals[s]. Now, if there was not
a great deal more than Chance in this Matter, even a wise Government of
the Creation, it could never happen that every Species of Animals should
be tied up to a certain Rate and Proportion of its Increase; the most
useful would not be the most fruitful, and the most pernicious produce
the fewest Young, as I have observed it commonly is. Neither would every
Species produce such a certain Rote as it is only able to breed up: But
all would be in a confused, huddled State. Instead of which, on the
contrary, we find every Thing in compleat Order; the Balance of _Genera_,
Species and Individuals always proportionate and even; the Balance of
Sexes the same; most Creatures tied up to their due Stint and Number
of Young, without their own Power and Choice, and others (particularly
of the winged[t] Kind) producing their due Number at their Choice and
Pleasure; some large Numbers, but not more than they can cover, feed and
foster; others fewer, but as many as they can well nurse and breed up.
Which minds me,

IV. Of the Diligence and earnest Concern which irrational Animals have of
the Production and Breeding up their Young. And here I have already taken
Notice of their Στοργὴ, or natural Affection, and with what Zeal they
feed and defend, their Young. To which may be added these two Things.

1. The wonderful Instinct of Incubation. It is utterly impossible,
that ever unthinking, untaught Animals should take to that only Method
of hatching their Young, was it not implanted in their Nature by the
infinitely wise Creator. But so ardent is their Desire, so unwearied is
their Patience when they are ingaged in that Business, that they will
abide their Nests for several Weeks, deny themselves the Pleasures, and
even the Necessaries of Life; some of them even starving themselves
almost, rather than hazard their Eggs, to get Food, and others either
performing the Office by Turns[u], or else the one kindly seeking out,
and carrying Food to the other[w], engaged in the office of Incubation.
But of these Matters in a more proper Place[x].

2. When the young ones are produced, not only with what Care do they feed
and nurse them, but with what surprizing Courage do all or most Creatures
defend them! It is somewhat strange to see timid Creatures[y], who at
other Times are cowardly, to be full of Courage, and undaunted at that
Time; to see them furiously and boldly encounter their Enemy, instead
of flying from him, and expose themselves to every Danger, rather than
hazard and forsake their Young.

With this earnest Concern of the irrational Animals for their Young, we
may join in the

V. And last Place, Their Faculty and Sagacity of feeding them. About
which I shall take notice of three Things.

1. The Faculty of suckling the Young, is an excellent Provision
the Creator hath made for those helpless Creatures. And here the
Agreeableness and Suitableness of that Food to young Creatures, deserves
particular Observation, as also their Delight in it, and Desire and
Endeavours after it, even as soon as born[z], together with the
Willingness of all, even the most savage and fierce Animals, to part
with it, and to administer it to their Young, yea, to teach and institute
them in the Art of taking it.

And lastly, to name no more, the curious _Apparatus_ which is made
for this Service in the divers Species of Animals, by a due Number of
Breasts, proportionable to the Occasions of each Animal, by curious
Glands in those Breasts, to separate that nutritive Juice, the Milk,
by Arteries and Veins to convey it to them, and proper Rivulets and
Channels to convey it from them, with Dugs and Nipples, placed in the
most convenient Part of the Body[aa] of each Animal, to administer it to
their Young; all these Things, I say, do manifestly proclaim the Care and
Wisdom of the great Creator.

2. As for such Animals as do in another manner breed up their Young, by
finding out Food, and putting it into their Mouth, the Provision made in
them for this Service, to strike, catch, to pouch and convey their Prey
and Food to their Young[bb], is very considerable. And so is also their
Sagacity in equally distributing it among them, that among many, all
shall be duly, equally, and in good Order, fed.

3. There is yet another Instinct remaining, of such Animals as can
neither administer Suck to their Young, neither lay them in Places
affording Food, nor can convey and bring them Food, but do with their
Eggs, lay up Provisions for their future Young. Somewhat of this is
reported of some Birds[cc]; but I have my self with Pleasure, frequently
seen some of the Species of Insects to carry ample Provisions into
their dry and barren Cells, where they have seal’d them carefully and
cautiously up with their Eggs, partly, ’tis like, for Incubation sake,
and partly as an easy Bed to lodge their Young; but chiefly for future
Provision for their Young, in their _Nympha-State_, when they stand in
need of Food[dd].


FOOTNOTES:

[a] _Spontaneous Generation_, is a Doctrine so generally exploded, that
I shall not undertake the Disproof of it. It is so evident, that all
Animals, yea, Vegetables too, owe their Production to Parent-Animals and
Vegetables; that I have often admir’d at the Sloath and Prejudices of the
ancient Philosophers, in so easily taking upon Trust the _Aristotelian_,
or rather, the _Ægyptian_ Doctrine of _equivocal Generation_; that
when they saw _Flies_, _Frogs_ and _Lice_, for Instance, to be Male
and Female, and accordingly to ingender, lay Eggs, _&c._ they could
ever imagine any of these Creatures should be spontaneously produc’d,
especially in so romantick a Manner, as in the Clouds: as they
particularly thought _Frogs_ were, and that they dropp’d down in Showers
of Rain. For an Answer to this Case of _Frogs_, I shall refer to a
Relation of my own, which my late most ingenious, and learned Friend, the
great Mr. _Ray_, requested of me, and was pleas’d to publish in his last
Edition of his _Wisdom of God manifested_, &c. _p. 365_.

But some will yet assert the Raining of _Frogs_; among which the curious
Dr. _Plot_ is somewhat of this Opinion; telling us of _Frogs_ found on
the Leads of the Lord _Aston_’s Gatehouse, at _Tixal_ in _Staffordshire_,
which he thinks by some such Means came there; as also on the
Bowling-Green, frequently after a Shower of Rain. _Plot_’s _Hist. Staff._
c. 1. §. 47.

But we may take a Judgment of this, and an Hundred such like Reports, to
be met with in considerable Authors, from other the like Reports that
have been better inquir’d into. In a Scarcity in _Silesia_, a mighty
Rumour was spread of its _raining Millet-Seed_; but the Matter being
inquir’d into, ’twas found to be only the Seeds of the _Ivy-leaved
Speedwell_, or _small Henbit_, growing in the Place in great Plenty.
_Eph. Germ. An. 3. Obs. 40._ So in the _Archipelago_, it was thought
Ashes were rain’d, Ships being cover’d therewith at a hundred Leagues
Distance; but in all Probability, it was from an Eruption of _Vesuvius_,
that then happen’d. About _Warminster_ in _Wilts_, ’twas reported it
_rain’d Wheat_; but a curious Observer, Mr. _Cole_, found it to be only
_Ivy-Berries_, blown thither in a considerable Quantity by a Tempest. In
the Year 1696, at _Cranstead_ near _Wrotham_ in _Kent_, a Pasture-Field
was over-spread with little young _Whitings_, suppos’d to fall from the
Clouds, in a Tempest of Thunder and Rain; but doubtless they were brought
thither with Waters from the Sea by the Tempest. See the before-commended
Mr. _Lowth_. _Abridg. Philos. Trans. Vol. 2._ p. 143, 144.

Neither needeth it seem strange, that _Ashes_, _Ivy-Berries_, small
_Fishes_, or young _Frogs_, (which yet may have some other Conveyance,)
should be thus transported by tempestuous Winds, considering to what
Distance, and in what Quantities the Sea-Waters were carry’d by the
_Great-Storm_, _Nov. 26. 1703_, of which an ingenious Friend sent
me these Accounts from _Lewes_ in _Sussex_, viz. _That a Physician
travelling soon after the Storm, to ~Tisehurst~, twenty Miles from the
Sea, as he rode along pluck’d some Tops of Hedges, and chewing them,
found them Salt: That some ~Grapes~ hanging on the Vines at ~Lewes~ were
so too. That Mr. ~Williamson~ Rector of ~Ripe~, found the Twigs in his
Gardens Salt the ~Monday~ after the Storm; and others observ’d the same
a Week after. That the Grass of the Downs about ~Lewes~, was so Salt,
that the Sheep would not feed till Hunger compell’d them: And that the
~Miller~ of ~Berwick~, (three Miles from the Sea,) attempting with his
Man to secure his Mill, were so wash’d with Flashes of Sea-Water, like
the Breakings of Waves against the Rocks, that they were almost strangled
therewith, and forced to give over their Attempt._

I call’d this Doctrine of _equivocal Generation_, an _Ægyptian Doctrine_;
because probably it had its Rise in _Ægypt_, to salve the Hypothesis, of
the Production of Men, and other Animals, out of the Earth, by the Help
of the Sun’s Heat. To prove which, the _Ægyptians_, (as _Diod. Sicul._
saith,) _produce this Observation, That about ~Thebes~, when the Earth is
moistened by the ~Nile~, by the Intense Heat of the Sun, an innumerable
Number of ~Mice~ do spring out._ From whence he infers, That all Kinds of
Animals, might as well at first come likewise out of the Earth. And from
these the learned Bishop _Stillingfleet_ thinks other Writers, as _Ovid_,
_Mela_, _Pliny_, &c. have, without examining its Truth, taken up the same
Hypothesis. _V._ _Stillingfleet_’s _Orig. Sacr._ Part 2. Book 1. Chap. 1.

The before-commended Dr. _Harris_, from the Observations of Dr. _Harvey_,
Sr. _Malpighi_, Dr. _de Graaf_, and Mr. _Leewenhoeck_, infers three
Things concerning _Generation_ as highly probable. _1. That Animals
are ~ex Animalculo~. 2. That the Animalcules are originally ~in femine
Marium, & non in Fœminis~. 3. That they can never come forward, or
be formed into Animals of the respective Kind, without the ~Ova in
Fœminis~._ His Proofs and Illustrations, see under the Word _Generation_,
in his _Lex. Techn. Vol. 2._

[f] The _Ephemeron_, as it is an unusual and special Instance of the
Brevity of Life; so I take to be a wonderful Instance of the special Care
and Providence of God, in the Conservation of the Species of that Animal.
For, 1. As an Animal, whose Life is determin’d in about five or six Hours
Time, (_viz._ from about six in the Evening, till about eleven a Clock
at Night,) needs no Food; so neither doth the _Ephemeron_ eat, after it
is become a _Fly_. 2. As to its Generation; in those five Hours of its
Life, it performs that, and all other necessary Offices of Life: For in
the Beginning of its Life, it sheds its Coat; and that being done, and
the poor little Animal thereby render’d light and agile, it spends the
rest of its short Time in striking over the Waters, and at the same Time
the Female droppeth her Egg on the Waters, and the Male his Sperm on them
to impregnate them. These Eggs are spread about by the Waters; descend
to the Bottom by their own Gravity; and are hatch’d by the Warmth of the
Sun, into little Worms, which make themselves Cases in the Clay, and feed
on the same without any Need of parental Care. _Vid._ _Ephem. vita_,
translated by Dr. _Tyson_ from _Swammerdam_. See also _Book VIII. Chap.
6. Note (r)._

[g] See _Chap. 13. Note (c)_, and _Book VIII. Chap. 6._

[h] The _Worms_ in _Chap. 11. Note (x)_, breed in the Holes they gnaw in
Stone, as manifest from their Eggs found therein.

[i] See _Book VIII. Chap. 6. Note (q)._

[k] Many, if not most Flies, especially those of the _Flesh-Fly_-kind,
have a Faculty of extending their _Uropygia_, and thereby are enabled to
thrust their Eggs into convenient Holes, and Receptacles for their Young,
in Flesh, and whatever else they Fly-blow. But none more remarkable
than the _Horse-Fly_, called by _Pennius_, in _Mouffet_, (p. 62.)
Σκολιοῦρος, i.e. _Curvicauda_, and the _Whame_ or _Burrel-Fly_, which is
vexatious to Horses in Summer, not by stinging them, but only by their
bombylious Noise, or tickling them in sticking their Nits, or Eggs on the
Hair; which they do in a very dexterous Manner, by thrusting out their
_Uropygia_, bending them up, and by gentle, slight Touches, sticking the
Eggs to the Hair of the Legs, Shoulders, and Necks, commonly of Horses;
so that Horses which go abroad, and are seldom dressed, are somewhat
discoloured by the numerous Nits adhering to their Hair.

Having mentioned so much of the Generation of this Insect, although it
be a little out of the Way, I hope I shall be excused for taking Notice
of the long-tailed Maggot, which is the Product of these Nits or Eggs,
called by Dr. _Plot_, _Eruca glabra_, [or rather _Eula Scabra_, it should
be] _caudata aquatico-arborea_, it being found by him in the Water of an
hollow Tree, but I have found it in Ditches, Saw-Pits, Holes of Water in
the High-way, and such-like Places where the Waters are most still and
foul. This Maggot I mention, as being a singular and remarkable Work of
God, not so much for its being so utterly unlike as it is to its Parent
_Bee_-like-Fly, as for the wise Provision made for it by its long Tail;
which is so joynted at certain Distances from the Body, as that it can
be withdrawn, or sheathed, one Part within another, to what Length the
Maggot pleaseth, so as to enable it to reach the Bottom of very shallow,
or deeper Waters, as it hath Occasion, for the gathering of Food. At the
end of this tapering is a Ramification of _Fibrillæ_, or small Hairs
representing, when spread, a Star; with the help of which, spread out on
the top of the Waters, it is enabled to hang making by that means a small
Depression or Concavity on the Surface of the Water. In the midst of this
Star, I imagine the Maggot takes in Air, there being a Perforation, which
with a Microscope I could perceive to be open, and by the Star to be
guarded against the Incursion of the Water.

[l] The Excrescences on the Root of _Cabbages_, _Turneps_, and divers
other Plants, have always a Maggot in them; but what the Animal is
that thus makes its way to the Root under Ground, whether _Ichneumon_,
_Phalæna_, _Scarab_, or _Scolopendra_, I could never discover, being not
able to bring them to any thing in Boxes.

[m] I presume they are only of the _Ichneumon-Fly-kind_, that have their
Generation in the Trunks of Vegetables. In _Malpighi de Gallis_, _Fig.
61._ is a good Cut of the gouty Excrescences, or rather Tumours of the
_Briar-stalk_: From which proceeds a small black _Ichneumon-Fly_, with
red _Legs_; black, smooth jointed _Antennæ_; pretty large _Thorax_; and
short, round _Belly_, of the Shape of an Heart. It leapeth as a _Flea_.
The _Male_, (as in other Insects,) is lesser than the _Female_, and very
venereous, in spite of Danger, getting upon the Female, whom they beat
and tickle with their Breeches and Horns, to excite them to a _Coït_.

Another Example of the Generation in the Trunks of Vegetables, shall be
from the Papers of my often-commended Friend Mr. _Ray_, which are in my
Hands, and that is an Observation of the ingenious Dr. _Nath. Wood_: _I
have_ (said he) _lately observed many Eggs in the common Rush. One sort
are little transparent Eggs, in Shape somewhat like a Pear, or Retort,
lying within the Skin, upon, or in the ~Medulla~, just against a brownish
Spot on the out-side of the Rush; which is apparently the Creatrix of the
Wound made by the Fly, when she puts her Eggs there. Another Kind is much
longer, and not so transparent, of a long oval, or rather cylindrical
Form; six, eight, or more, lie commonly together, across the Rush,
parallel to each other, like the Teeth of a Comb, and are as long as the
Breadth of the Rush._ Letter from _Kilkenny_ in _Ireland_, Apr. 28. 1697.

[n] See _Book VIII. Chap. 6. Note (d)._

[o] I have in _Chap. 13. Note (u)_, and _Book VIII. Chap. 6. Note (c),
(f)_, taken Notice of the Nidification and Generation of some Insects
on the Leaves of Vegetables, and shall therefore, for the Illustration
of this Place, chuse an uncommon Example out of the _Scarab-kind_ (the
Generation of which Tribe hath not been as yet mentioned) and that
is of a small _Scarab_ bred in the very Tips of _Elm-Leaves_. These
Leaves, in Summer, may be observed to be, many of them, dry and dead, as
also turgid; in which lieth a dirty, whitish, rough Maggot. From which
proceeds a _Beetle_ of the smallest kind, of a light, _Weesle_ Colour,
that leapeth like a _Grashopper_, although its Legs are but short. Its
Eyes are blackish, _Elytra_ thin, and prettily furrowed, with many
Concavities in them; small club-headed _Antennæ_, and a long _Rostrum_
like a _Proboscis_.

The same, or much like this, I have met with on Tips of _Oaken_ and
_Holly-Leaves_. How the _Scarab_ lays its Eggs in the Leaf, whether by
terebrating the Leaf, or whether the _Maggot_, when hatched, doth it, I
could never see. But with great Dexterity, it makes its Way between the
upper and under Membranes of the Leaf feeding upon the parenchymous Part
thereof. Its Head is slenderer and sharper than most of _Maggots_, as if
made on purpose for this Work; but yet I have often wondered at their
Artifice in so nicely separating the Membranes of the _Elm-Leaf_, without
breaking them, and endangering their own tumbling out of ’em, considering
how thin and very tender the Skins of that Leaf (particularly) are.

[t] Mr. _Ray_ alledges good Reasons to conclude, that although Birds have
not an exact Power of numbering, yet, that they have of distinguishing
many from few, and knowing when they come near to a certain Number; and
that they have it in their Power to lay many or few Eggs. All which he
manifesteth from _Hens_, and other domestick Fowls, laying many more Eggs
when they are withdrawn, than when not. Which holds in wild as well as
domestick Birds, as appears from Dr. _Lister_’s Experiment in withdrawing
a _Swallow_’s Eggs, which by that Means laid nineteen Eggs successively
before she gave over. _V._ _~Ray~’s Wisdom of God_, &c. p. 137.

prodigious Bag under its Bill and Throat, big enough to contain thirty
Pints. _Id. ibid._ p. 122. And to name no more, the common _Heron_ hath
its most remarkable Parts adapted to thus Service; long Legs for wading,
and a long Neck answerable thereto to reach Prey, a wide, extensive
Throat to pouch it; long Toes, with strong hooked Talons, (one of which
is remarkably serrate on the Edge) the better to hold their Prey; a long
sharp Bill to strike their Prey, and serrate towards the Point, with
sharp hooked Beards standing backward, to hold their Prey fast when
struck; and lastly, large, broad, concave Wings (in Appearance much too
large, heavy and cumbersome for so small a Body, but) of greatest Use to
enable them to carry the greater Load to their Nests at several Miles
Distance; as I have seen them do from several Miles beyond me, to a large
Heronry above three Miles distant from me. In which I have seen _Plaise_,
and other Fish, some Inches long, lying under the high Trees in which
they build; and the curious and ingenious Owner thereof, _D’Acre Barret_,

Annoyance it gave them in their Flight, by its twisting this Way and that

_The Conclusion._


Thus I have, as briefly as well I could (and much more briefly than the
Matters deserved) dispatched the Decad of Things I proposed in common
to the sensitive Creatures. And now let us pause a little, and reflect.
And upon the whole Matter, what less can be concluded than that there is
a Being infinitely Wise, Potent, and Kind, who is able to contrive and
make this glorious Scene of Things, which I have thus given only a Glance
of? For what less than Infinite, could stock so vast a Globe with such a
noble Set of Animals? All so Contrived, as to minister to one another’s
Help some Way or other, and most of them serviceable to Man peculiarly,
the Top of this lower World, and who was made, as it were, on purpose to
observe, and survey, and set forth the Glory of the infinite _Creator_,
manifested in his Works! Who! What but the Great _GOD_ could so admirably
provide for the whole Animal World every Thing serviceable to it, or that
can be wished for, either to conserve its Species, or to minister to
the Being or Well-being of Individuals! Particularly, who could _Feed_
so spacious a World, who could please so large a Number of Palates, or
suit so many Palates to so great a Variety of Food, but the infinite
Conservator of the World! And who but the same great _HE_, could provide
such commodious _Cloathing_ for every Animal; such proper _Houses_,
_Nests_ and _Habitations_; such suitable _Armature_ and _Weapons_; such
_Subtilty_, _Artifice_ and _Sagacity_, as every Creature is more or less
armed and furnished with, to fence off the Injuries of the Weather, to
rescue it self from Dangers, to preserve it self from the Annoyances
of its Enemies; and, in a word, to conserve its Self, and its Species!
What but an infinite superintending Power could so equally _balance_ the
several Species of Animals, and conserve the _Numbers_ of the individuals
of every Species so even, as not to over or under-people the terraqueous
Globe! Who, but the infinite wise Lord of the World, could allot every
Creature its most suitable _Place_ to live in, the most suitable Element
to _breath_, and _move_, and _act_ in. And who but _HE_ could make so
admirable a Set of Organs, as those of Respiration are, both in Land and
Water-Animals! Who could contrive so curious a Set of Limbs, Joynts,
Bones, Muscles, and Nerves, to give to every Animal the most commodious
_Motion_ to its State and Occasions! And to name no more, what Anatomist,
Mathematician, Workman, yea Angel, could contrive and make so curious,
so commodious, and every way so exquisite a Set of Senses, as the _five
Senses_ of Animals are; whole Organs are so dexterously contrived, so
conveniently placed in the Body, so neatly adjusted, so firmly guarded,
and so compleatly suited to every Occasion, that they plainly set forth
the Agency of the infinite Creator and Conservator of the World.

So that here, upon a transient View of the Animal World in general only,
we have such a Throng of Glories, such an enravishing Scene of Things as
may excite us to admire, praise, and adore the infinitely wise, powerful,
and kind _CREATOR_; to condemn all atheistical Principles; and with holy
_David_, _Psalm_ xiv. 1. to conclude that he is in good earnest a _Fool_,
that dares to say, _There is no God_, when we are every where surrounded
with such manifest Characters, and plain Demonstrations of that infinite
Being.

But in the next Book we shall still find greater Tokens, if possible,
when I come to take a View of Animals in particular.

BOOK V.

_A SURVEY of MAN._


The first _Genus_ of Animals that I shall take Notice of, shall be _Man_,
who may justly claim the Precedence in our Discourse, inasmuch as God
hath given him the Superiority in the Animal World; _Gen._ i. 26. _And
God said, Let us make Man in our Image, after our Likeness; and let them
have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and
over the Cattle, and over all the Earth, and over every creeping Thing
that creepeth upon the Earth._

And as to Man, we have so excellent a Piece of Workmanship, such a
Microcosm, such an Abridgment of the Creator’s Art in him, as is alone
sufficient to demonstrate the Being and Attributes of _GOD_. Which will
appear by considering the _Soul_ and the _Body_ of Man.




CHAP. I.

_Of the SOUL of Man._


My Survey of Man, I shall begin with the Soul of Man, by Reason it is
his most noble Part[a], the Copy of the Divine Image in us[b], in which
we have enough to fill us with Admiration of the Munisence, Power,
and Wisdom of the Infinite Creator[c], when we contemplate the noble
Faculties of this our superiour Part, the vast Reach and Compass of
its _Understanding_, the prodigious Quickness and Piercingness of its
_Thought_, the admirable Subtilty of its _Invention_, the commanding
Power of its _Wisdom_, the great Depth of its _Memory_[d], and in a word,
its Divine Nature and Operations.

But I shall not dwell on this, tho’ the superiour Part of Man, because
it is the least known. Only there are two Things I can’t easily pass
by, because they manifest the especial Concurrence and Design of the
infinitely Wise Creator, as having a particular and necessary Tendency to
the Management and good Order of the World’s Affairs. The

I. Of which is the various _Genii_, or _Inclinations of Men’s Minds_
to this, and that, and the other Business[e]. We see how naturally
Men betake themselves to this and that Employment: Some delight most
in Learning and Books, some in Divinity, some in Physick, Anatomy and
Botany, some in Critical Learning and Philology, some in Mathematicks,
some in Metaphysicks, and deep Researches; and some have their Delight
chiefly in Mechanicks, Architecture, War, Navigation, Commerce,
Agriculture; and some have their Inclinations lie even to the servile
Offices of the World, and an hundred Things besides.

Now all this is an admirably wise, as well as most necessary Provision,
for the easy and sure transacting the World’s Affairs; to answer every
End and Occasion of Man, yea, to make Man Helpful to the poor, helpless
Beasts, as far as his Help is needful to them; and all, without any great
Trouble, Fatigue, or great Inconvenience to Man; rather as a Pleasure,
and Diversion to him. For so far it is from being a Toil, that the
greatest Labours[f], Cares, yea, and Dangers too, become pleasant to him
who is pursuing his _Genius_; and whose Ardour of Inclination eggs him
forward, and buoys him up under all Opposition, and carrieth him through
every Obstacle, to the End of his Designs and Desires.

II. The next is, The _inventive_ Power of the Soul[g]. Under which I
might speak of many Things; but I shall take Notice only of two, because
they manifest the particular Concern and Agency of the infinitely wise
Creator. The

1. Is, That _Man’s Invention_ should reach to such a great Variety of
Matters; that it should hit upon every Thing, that may be of any Use,
either to himself, or to human Society; or that may any Ways promote,
(what in him lies,) the Benefit of this lower Part of the Creation.

For the Illustration of this, I might take a View of all the Arts and
Sciences, the Trades, yea, the very Tools they perform their Labours,
and Contrivances with, as numerous as their Occasions and Contrivances
are various. Indeed, What is there that falleth under the Reach of
Man’s Senses, that he doth not employ to some Use and Purpose, for the
World’s Good? The celestial Bodies, the Sun, the Moon, with the other
Planets, and the fix’d Stars, he employs to the noble Uses of Astronomy,
Navigation and Geography. And, What a noble Acumen, what a vast Reach
must the Soul be endow’d with, to invent those curious Sciences of
Geometry and Arithmetick, both Specious, and in Numbers; and those nice
and various Instruments, made use of by the Geometrician, Astronomer,
Geographer and Sailor? And lastly, What a wonderful Sagacity is shewn in
the Business of Optics, and particularly in the late Invention of the
Telescope; wherewith new Wonders are discover’d among God’s Works, in
the Heavens, as there are here on Earth, with the Microscope, and other
Glasses.

And as for this lower World, What Material is here to be found; what kind
of Earth, or Stone, or Metal; what Animal, Tree, or Plant, yea, even the
very Shrubs of the Field; in a Word, what of all the excellent Variety,
the Creator has furnish’d the World with, for all its Uses and Occasions,
in all Ages; what, I say, that Man’s Contrivance doth not extend unto,
and make some Way or other advantagious to himself, and useful for
Building, Cloathing, Food, Physick, or for Tools or Utensils, or for even
only Pleasure and Diversion?

But now considering the great Power and Extent of human Invention.

2. There is another Thing, that doth farther demonstrate the
Super-intendence of the great Creator, and Conservator of the World; and
that is, That Things of great, and absolutely necessary Use, have soon,
and easily occurr’d to the Invention of Man; but Things of little Use, or
very dangerous Use, are rarely and slowly discover’d, or still utterly
undiscover’d. We have as early as the _Mosaick_ History, an Account of
the Inventions of the more useful Crafts and Occupations: Thus _Gen._
iii. 23. Adam _was sent forth from the Garden of ~Eden~, by God himself,
to till the Ground._ And in the next Chapter, his two Sons _Cain_ and
_Abel_; the one was of the same Occupation, a Tiller of the Ground, the
other a Keeper of Sheep[h]. And the Posterity of these, are in the latter
End of _Gen._ iv. recorded, _~Jabal~ to have been the Father of such as
dwell in Tents_[i]; _i.e._ He was the _Inventor of Tents_, and pitching
those moveable Houses in the Fields, for looking after, and depasturing
their Cattel in the Desarts, and uncultivated World. _~Tubal-Cain~ was an
Instructer of every Artificer in Brass and Iron_[k], or the First that
found out the Art of _melting, and malleating[l] Metals_, and making
them useful for Tools, and other necessary Implements. And his Sister
_Naamah_, whose Name is only mentioned, is by some thought to have been
the Inventor of _Spinning_ and _Cloathing_. Yea, the very Art of _Musick_
is thus early ascribed to _Jubal_[m]; so indulgent was the Creator, to
find a Means to divert Melancholy, to cheer the Spirits, and to entertain
and please Mankind. But for Things of no Use, or but little Use, or of
pernicious Consequence; either they have been much later thought of, and
with great Difficulty, and perhaps Danger too, brought to pass; or else
they still are, and perhaps will always remain, Exercises of the Wit and
Invention of Men.

Of this we might give divers Instances: In Mathematicks, about squaring
the Circle[n]; in Mechanicks[o], about the Art of Flying; and in
Navigation, about finding the Longitude. These Things, although some of
them in Appearance innocent, yea, perhaps very useful, yet remain for
the most Part secret; not because the Discovery of most of them is more
impossible, or difficult than of many other Things, which have met with a
Discovery; nor is it for want of Man’s Diligence therein, or his careful
Pursuit and Enquiry after them, (for perhaps, nothing already discover’d
hath been more eagerly sought after;) but with much better Reason, (I
am sure with greater Humility and Modesty,) we may conclude it is,
because the infinitely wise Creator, and Ruler of the World, hath been
pleas’d to lock up these Things from Man’s Understanding and Invention,
for some Reasons best known to himself, or because they might be of ill
Consequence, and dangerous amongst Men.

As in all Probability the Art of Flying would particularly be: An
Art which in some Cases might be of good Use, as to the Geographer
and Philosopher; but in other Respects, might prove of dangerous and
fatal Consequence: As for instance, By putting it in Man’s Power to
discover the Secrets of Nations and Families, more than is consistent
with the Peace of the World, for Man to know; by giving ill Men greater
Opportunities to do Mischief, which it would not lie in the Power of
others to prevent; and, as one[p] observes, by making Men less sociable:
“For upon every true or false Ground of Fear, or Discontent, and other
Occasions, he would have been fluttering away to some other Place; and
Mankind, instead of cohabiting in Cities, would, like the Eagle, have
built their Nests upon Rocks”.

That this is the true Reason of these Matters, is manifest enough from
holy Scripture, and Reason[q] also gives its Suffrage thereto. The
_Scripture_ expressly tells us, That _every good Gift, and every perfect
Gift, is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights_, _S._
James i. 17. _Solomon_, Prov. ii. 6. saith, _The Lord giveth Wisdom; out
of his Mouth cometh Knowledge and Understanding._ And _Elihu_ is very
express, Job xxxii. 8. _But there is a Spirit in Man, and the Inspiration
of the Almighty giveth them Understanding_, Πνοὴ παντοκράτορός ἐστιν ἡ
διδάσκουσα, as the LXX render it, _The Inspiratus, the Afflatus of the
Almighty, is their Instructor, Mistress or Teacher._ And in Scripture,
not only the more noble, superiour Acts of Wisdom or Science; but much
inferiour also, bear the Name of Wisdom, Knowledge and Understanding,
and are ascrib’d unto GOD. ’Tis well known that _Solomon_’s Wisdom is
wholly ascrib’d unto GOD; and the Wisdom and Understanding which GOD is
said to have given him, 1 _Kings_ iv. 29. is particularly set forth in
the following Verses, by his great Skill in moral and natural Philosophy,
in Poetry, and probably in Astronomy, Geometry, and such other of the
politer Sciences, for which _Ægypt_, and the _eastern Nations_ were
celebrated of old[r]: _And ~Solomon~’s Wisdom excell’d the Wisdom of all
the Children of the east Country, and all the Wisdom of ~Ægypt~. For he
was wiser than all Men, than ~Ethan~, &c. And he spake 3000 Proverbs:
And his Songs were 1005. And he spake of Trees, from the Cedar to the
Hyssop of the Wall, ~(_i.e._ of all Sorts of Plants;)~ also of Beasts,
Fowl, creeping Things, and Fishes._ So likewise the Wisdom of _Daniel_,
and his three Companions, is ascrib’d unto GOD, _Dan._ i. 17. _As for
these four Children, God gave them Knowledge, and Skill in all Learning
and Wisdom; and ~Daniel~ had Understanding in all Visions and Dreams._
And accordingly in the next Chapter, _Daniel_ acknowledgeth and praiseth
God. ℣. 20. 21. _~Daniel~ answered and said, Blessed be the Name of God
for ever and ever, for Wisdom and Might are his.——He giveth Wisdom unto
the Wise, and Knowledge to them that know Understanding._ But not only
Skill in the superiour Arts and Sciences; but even in the more inferiour
mechanick Art, is call’d by the same Names, and ascrib’d unto GOD: Thus
for the Workmanship of the Tabernacle, _Exod._ xxxi. 2. to ℣. 6. _See,
I have call’d ~Bezaleel~; and I have fill’d him with the Spirit of God,
in Wisdom, and in Understanding, and in all Manner of Workmanship: To
devise cunning Works, to work in Gold, Silver and Brass; and in cutting
of Stones, to set them; and in carving of Timber, to work in all Manner
of Workmanship._ So the _Spinsters_, _Weavers_, and other Crafts-people,
are call’d wise-hearted, _Exod._ xxxiv. 10. 25. and other Places. And
in _Exod._ xxxvi. 1. &c. the LORD is said to have put this Wisdom in
them, and Understanding to know how to work all these Manner of Works,
for the Service of the Sanctuary. And lastly, to name no more Instances,
_Hiram_ the chief Architect of _Solomon_’s _Temple_, is in 1 _Kings_ vii.
14. and 2 _Chron._ ii. 14. call’d _a cunning Man, fill’d with Wisdom
and Understanding, to work in Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron, Stone, Timber,
Purple, Blue, fine Linen, and Crimson; also to grave, and find out every
Device which should be put to him._

Thus doth the Word of _God_, ascribe the Contrivances and Crafts of
Men, to the Agency, or Influence of the _Spirit_ of _God_, upon that
of Man. And there is the same Reason for the Variety of _Genii_, or
_Inclinations_ of Men also; which from the same Scriptures, may be
concluded to be a Designation, and Transaction of the same almighty
Governour of the World’s Affairs. And who indeed but HE, could make
such a divine Substance, endow’d with those admirable Faculties, and
Powers, as the rational Soul hath; a Being to bear the great Creator’s
Vicegerency in this lower World; to employ the several Creatures; to make
Use of the various Materials; to manage the grand Businesses; and to
survey the Glories of all the visible Works of God? A Creature, without
which this lower World would have been a dull, uncouth, and desolate kind
of Globe. Who, I say, or what less than the _infinite GOD_, could make
such a rational Creature, such a divine Substance as the Soul? For if we
should allow the Atheist any of his nonsensical Schemes, the _Epicurean_
his fortuitous Concourse of Atoms, or the _Cartesian_[s] his created
Matter put in Motion; yet with what tolerable Sense could he, in his Way,
produce such a divine, thinking, speaking, contriving Substance as the
Soul is; endow’d exactly with such Faculties, Power, and Dispositions
as the various Necessities and Occasions of the World require from such
a Creature? Why should not rather all the Acts, the Dispositions and
Contrivances of such a Creature as Man, (if made in a mechanical Way,
and not contriv’d by God,) have been the same? Particularly, Why should
he not have hit upon all Contrivances of equal Use, early as well as
many Ages since? Why not that Man have effected it, as well as this,
some thousands of Years after? Why also should not all Nations, and
all Ages[t], improve in every Thing, as well as this, or that Age, or
Nation[u] only? why should the _Greeks_, the _Arabians_, the _Persians_,
or the _Ægyptians_ of old, so far exceed those of the same Nations now?
Why the _Africans_ and _Americans_ so generally ignorant and barbarous,
and the _Europeans_, for the most part, polite and cultivated, addicted
to Arts and Learning? How could it come to pass that the Use of the
Magnet[w], Printing[x], Clocks[y], Telescopes[z], and all hundred Things
besides, should escape the Discovery of _Archimedes_, _Anaximander_,
_Anaximenes_, _Posidonius_, or other great Virtuoso’s of the early Ages,
whose Contrivances of various Engines, Spheres, Clepsydræ and other
curious Instruments are recorded[aa]? And why cannot the present or past
Age, so eminent for polite Literature, for Discoveries and Improvements
in all curious Arts and Businesses (perhaps beyond any known Age of the
World; why cannot it, I say) discover those hidden _Quæsita_, which
may probably be reserved for the Discovery of future and less learned
Generations?

Of these Matters, no satisfactory Account can be given by any mechanical
Hypothesis, or any other Way, without taking in the Superintendence of
the great Creator and Ruler of the World; who oftentimes doth manifest
himself in some of the most considerable of those Works of Men, by some
remarkable Transactions of his Providence, or by some great Revolution
or other happening in the World thereupon. Of this I might instance in
the Invention of Printing[bb], succeeded first by a train of Learned Men,
and the Revival of Learning, and soon after that by the Reformation,
and the much greater Improvements of Learning at this Day. But the most
considerable Instance I can give is, the Progress of Christianity, by
means of the civilized Disposition, and large Extent of the _Roman
Empire_. The latter of which, as it made way for human Power; so the
former made way for our most excellent Religion into the Minds of Men.
And so I hope, and earnestly pray, that the Omnipotent and All-wise
Ruler of the World will transact the Affairs of our most Holy Religion,
e’er it be long, in the Heathen World; that the great Improvements made
in the last, and present Age, in Arts and Sciences, in Navigation and
Commerce, may be a Means to transport our Religion, as well as Name,
through all the Nations of the Earth. For we find that our Culture of the
more polite and curious Sciences, and our great Improvements in even the
Mechanick Arts, have already made a Way for us into some of the largest
and farthest distant Nations of the Earth; particularly into the great
Empire of _China_[cc].

And now, before I quit this Subject, I cannot but make one Remark, by way
of practical Inference, from what has been last said; and that is, Since
it appears that the Souls of Men are ordered, disposed and actuated by
God, even in secular, as well as spiritual Christian Acts; a Duty ariseth
thence on every Man, to pursue the Ends, and answer all the Designs of
the divine Providence, in bestowing his Gifts and Graces upon him. Men
are ready to imagine their Wit, Learning, Genius, Riches, Authority, and
such like, to be Works of Nature, Things of Course, or owing to their own
Diligence, Subtilty, or some Secondary Causes; that they are Masters of
them, and at Liberty to use them as they please, to gratifie their Lust
or Humour, and satsifie their depraved Appetites. But it is evident, that
these Things are the Gifts of God, they are so many Talents entrusted
with us by the infinite Lord of the World, a Stewardship, a Trust
reposed in us; for which we must give an Account at the Day when our Lord
shall call; according to the parabolical Representation of this Matter by
our Blessed Saviour, _Matt._ xxv. 14.

Our Duty then is not to abuse these Gifts of God, _not to neglect the
Gift that is in us_, not to _hide our Talent in the Earth_; but as St.
_Paul_ exhorteth _Timothy_, _2 Tim._ i. _6._ we must _stir up the Gift
of God which is in us_, and not let it lie idle, concealed or dead; but
we must ἀναζωπυρεῖν τὸ χάρισμα, _blow it up, and enkindle it_, as the
Original imports; we must improve and employ our Gift to the Glory of the
Giver; or in that Ministration, that Use and Service of the World, for
which he gave it. Our Stewardship, our Craft, our Calling, be it that
of Ambassadors of Heaven, committed to us, as ’twas to _Timothy_,[dd]
by the laying on of Hands; or be it the more secular Business of the
Gentleman, Tradesman, Mechanick, or only Servant; nay, our good Genius,
our Propensity to any Good, as suppose to History, Mathematicks, Botany,
Natural Philosophy, Mechanicks, _&c._ I say all these Occupations, in
which the Providence of God hath engaged Men, all the Inclinations to
which his Spirit hath disposed them, ought to be discharged with that
Diligence, that Care and Fidelity, that our great Lord and Master may not
say to us, as He said to the unfaithful Steward, _Luke_ xvi. 2. _Give an
Account of thy Stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer Steward_; but
that he may say, as ’tis in the Parable before cited, _Mat._ xxv. 21.
_Well done thou good and faithful Servant, thou hast been faithful over
a few Things, I will make thee Ruler over many Things, enter thou into
the Joy of thy Lord_. Since now the Case is thus, let us be persuaded
to follow _Solomon_’s Advice, _Eccles._ ix. 10. _Whatsoever thy Hand
findeth to do, do it with thy Might_[ee]: “Lay hold on every Occasion
that presents it self, and improve it with the utmost Diligence; because
now is the Time of Action, both in the Employments of the Body, and of
the Mind; now is the Season of studying either Arts and Sciences, or
Wisdom and Virtue, for which thou wilt have no Opportunities in the Place
whither thou art going in the other World. _For there is no Work, nor
Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wisdom in the Grave whither thou goest._”

last Century; when in the Year 1657, those very ingenious and great Men,
Mr _William Neile_, and my Lord _Brounker_, and Sir _Christopher Wren_
afterwards, in the same Year, geometrically demonstrated the Equality
of some Curves to a strait Line. Soon after which, others at Home, and
Abroad, did the like in other Curves. And not long afterwards, this was
brought under an _analytical Calculus_: The first Specimen whereof, that
was ever publish’d. Mr. _Mercator_ gave in 1688, in a Demonstration of
my Lord _Brounker_’s Quadrature of the _Hyperbola_, by Dr _Wallis_’s
Reduction of a Fraction, into an infinite Series by Division. But
the penetrating Genius of Sir _Isaac Newton_, had discover’d a Way
of attaining the Quantity of all quadrible Curves analytically, by
his Method of _Fluxions_, some Time before the Year 1668, as I find
very probable from an historical Account, in a long Letter of Mr.
_Collins_, written in his own Hand, and sent to _Richard Townley_, Esq;
of _Lancashire_, whose Papers are in my Hands. In that Letter, Mr.
_Collins_ saith, That _in ~September 1668~, Mr. ~Mercator~ publish’d
his ~Logarithmotechnia~, one of which he soon sent to Dr. ~Barrow~, who
thereupon sent him up some Papers of Mr. ~Newton~’s, ~[now Sir _Isaac_;]~
by which, and former Communications made thereof by the Author, to the
Doctor; it appears that the said Method was invented some Years before,
by the said Mr. ~Newton~, and generally apply’d._ And then he goes on
to give some Account of the Method; what it performs in the Circle,
_&c._ what Mr. _Gregory_ had done in that kind, _who intended to publish
somewhat in ~Latin~ about it, but would not anticipate Mr. ~Newton~, the
first Inventor thereof_; with much more of this Nature. The Design, I
find, of that indefatigable Promoter of Mathematicks, Mr. _Collins_, was
to acquaint Mr. _Townley_, in his Letter, with what had been done; and to
get the Assistance of that ingenious Gentleman, towards the compleating a
Body of _Algebra_.

[o] I do not mention here the _perpetual Motion_, which hath exercis’d
the mechanical Wits for many Ages; because it is a Thing impossible, if
not a Contradiction: As the before-commended Dr. _Clarke_ asserts in
_Rohaul. Phys._ p. 133.

[r] _Ægypt_, and some of the _eastern_ Nations, are celebrated for their
Skill in polite Literature: both in Scripture and profane story: _Job_
was of those Parts; so were the Σοφοὶ and Μάγοι, the _Brachmans_ and
_Gymnosophists_. _Moses_ and _Daniel_ had their Education in these Parts:
And _Pythagoras_, _Democritus_, and others, travell’d into these Parts
for the Sake of their Learning.

[s] As we are not to _accuse_ any _falsly_; so far be it from me to
detract from so great a Man as _Monsieur Cartes_ was: Whose Principles,
although many have perverted to atheistical Purposes, and whose Notions
have, some of them, but an ill Aspect; yet I am unwilling to believe
he was an Atheist; since in his _Principia Philosiphiæ_, and other
of his Works, he vindicates himself from this Charge; and frequently
shews seemingly a great Respect for Religion: Besides, That many of
his suspicious Opinions are capable of a favourable Interpretation,
which will make them appear in a better Form: Thus when he discardeth
_final Causes_ from his Philosophy, it is not a Denial of them; but only
excluding the Consideration of them, for the Sake of free philosophising;
it being the Business of a Divine, rather than a Philosopher, to treat of
them.

[t] For Ages of _Learning_ and _Ignorance_, we may compare the present,
and some of the Ages before the Reformation. The last Century, and the
few Years of this, have had the Happiness to be able to vie with any Age
for the Number of learned Men of all Professions, and the Improvement
made in all Arts and Sciences; too many, and too well known to need a
Specification.

But for Ignorance, we may take the ninth Age, and so down to the
Reformation; even as low as Queen _Elizabeth_, although Learning
began to flourish; yet we may guess how Matters stood, even among the
Clergy, by her 53 _Injunct._ Nᵒ. 1559, _Such as are but mean Readers,
shall peruse over before, once or twice, the Chapters and Homilies, to
the Intent they may read to the better Understanding of the People,
the more Encouragement of Godliness._ Spar. Collect. p. 82. But this
is nothing, in comparison to the Ages before, when the Monk said,
_Græcum non est legi_; or as _Espencæus_ more elegantly hath it,
_Gracè nôsse suspectum, Hebraicè prope Hæreticum_. Which Suspicion,
(said the learned _Hakewill_,) _Rhemigius_ surely was not guilty of,
in commenting upon _diffamatus_, 1 _Thes._ i. 8. who saith, that St.
_Paul_ somewhat improperly put that for _divulgatus_, not being aware
that St. _Paul_ wrote in _Greek_, and not in _Latin_. Nay, so great was
their Ignorance, not only of _Greek_, but of _Latin_ too, that a Priest
baptiz’d _in nomine Patria, & Filia, & Spiritua sancta_. Another suing
his Parishioners for not paving his Church, prov’d it from _Jer._ xvii.
18. _Paveant illi, non paveam ego_. Some Divines in _Erasmus_’s Time,
undertook to prove Hereticks ought to be burnt, because the Apostle said,
_Hæreticum devita_. Two Fryars disputing about a Plurality of Worlds, one
prov’d it from _Annon decem sunt facti mundi?_ The other reply’d, _Sed
ubi sunt novem?_ And notwithstanding their Service was read in _Latin_,
yet so little was that understood, that an old Priest in _Hen._ VIII.
read _Mumpsimus Domine_, for _Sumpsimus_: And being admonish’d of it,
he said, he had done so for thirty Years, and would not leave his old
_Mumpsimus_ for their new _Sumpsimus_. Vid. _Hakew. Apol._ L. 3. c. 7.
_Sect. 2._

[u] _There is (it seems) in Wits and Arts, as in all Things beside, a
kind of circular Progress: They have their Birth, their Growth, their
Flourishing, their Failing, their Fading; and within a while after,
their Resurrection, and Reflourishing again. The Arts flourished for a
long Time among the ~Persians~, the ~Chaldæans~, the ~Ægyptians~.——But
afterwards the ~Grecians~ got the start of them, ~and are now become as
barbarous themselves, as formerly they esteemed all besides themselves
to be~._ About the Birth of _Christ_, Learning began to flourish in
_Italy_, and spread all over _Christendom_; till the _Goths_, _Huns_, and
_Vandals_ ransacked the Libraries, and defaced almost all the Monuments
of Antiquity: so that the Lamp of Learning seemed to be put out for near
the Space of 1000 Years, till the first _Mansor_, king of _Africa_ and
_Spain_, raised up, and spurred forward the _Arabian_ Wits, by great
Rewards and Encouragement. Afterwards _Petrarch_ opened such Libraries as
were undemolished. He was seconded by _Boccace_, and _John_ of _Ravenna_,
and soon after by _Aretine_, _Philelphus_, _Valla_, &c. And those were
followed by _Æneas Sylvius_, _Angelus Politianus_, _Hermolaus Barbarus_,
_Marsilius Ficinus_, and _Joh. Picus_, of _Mirandula_. These were backed
by _Rud. Agricola_, _Reucline_, _Melancthon_, _Joach. Camerarius_,
_Wolphlazius_, _Beat. Rhenanus_, Almaines; By _Erasmus_ of _Rotterdam_;
_Vives_ a _Spaniard_; _Bembus_, _Sadoletus_, _Eugubinus_, Italians:
_Turnebus_, _Muretus_, _Ramus_, _Pithæus_, _Budæus_, _Amiot_, _Scaliger_,
Frenchmen; Sir _Tho. More_ and _Linaker_, Englishmen. And about this
Time, even those Northern Nations yielded their great Men; _Denmark_
yielded _Olaus Magnus_, _Holster_, _Tycho Brahe_, and _Hemingius_; and
_Poland_, _Hosius_, _Frixius_, and _Crumerus_. But to name the Worthies
that followed these, down to the present Time, would be endless, and next
to impossible. See therefore _Hakewill_’s _Apolog._ L. 3. c. 6. §. 2.

[w] Dr. _Gilbert_, the most learned and accurate Writer on the _Magnet_,
shews, that its _Attractive_ Virtue was known as early as _Plato_ and
_Aristotle_: but its _Direction_ was a Discovery of later Ages. He saith,
_Superiori ævo 300 aut 400 labentibus annis, Motus Magneticus in Boream
& Austrum repertus, aut ab hominibus rursus recognitus fuit._ De Mag.
L. 1. c. 1. But who the happy Inventer of this lucky Discovery was,
is not known. There is some, not inconsiderable, Reason, to think our
famous Country-man, _Rog. Bacon_, either discovered, or at least knew
of it. But for its Use in Navigation, Dr. _Gilbert_ saith, _in regno
Neapolitano Melphitani omnium primi (utì ferunt) pyxidem instruebant
nauticam.——edocti à cive quodam Jol. Goia_ A. D. 1300. ibid. If the
Reader hath a mind to see the Arguments for the Invention, being as old
as _Solomon_’s or _Plautus_’s Time, or of much younger Date, he may
consult _Hakewill._ ib. c. 10. §. 4. or _Purchas Pilgr._ L. 1. c. 1. §. 1.

As to the Magnetick Variation, Dr. _Gilbert_ attributes the Discovery
of it to _Sebastian Cabott_. And the Inclination, or Dipping of the
Needle, was the Discovery of our ingenious _Rob. Norman_. And lastly, The
Variation of the Variation was first found out by the ingenious Mr. _H.
Gellibrand_. Astr. Prof. of _Gresham-Col._ about 1634. _Vid._ _Gellibr.
Disc. Math. on the Variat. of the Mag. Need. and its Variat._ Anno 1635.

But since that, the before commended Dr. _Halley_, having formerly, in
_Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ. 148, and 195, given a probable Hypothesis of the
Variation of the Compass, did in the Year 1700, undertake a long and
hazardous Voyage, as far as the Ice near the South Pole, in order to
examine his said Hypothesis, and to make a System of the Magnetical
Variations: Which being soon after published, has been since abundantly
confirmed by the _French_, as may be seen in several of the late _Memoirs
de Physique & de Mathematique_, publish’d by the French _Academie des
Sciences_.

To these Discoveries, I hope the Reader will excuse me, if I add one of
my own, which I deduced some Years ago, from some magnetical Experiments
and Observations I made; which Discovery I also acquainted our Royal
Society with some time since, _viz._ That as the common, horizontal
Needle is continually varying up and down, towards the E. and W. so
is the Dipping-Needle varying up and down, towards or fromwards the
Zenith, with its Magnetick Tendency, describing a Circle round the Pole
of the World, as I conceive, or some other Point. So that if we could
procure a Needle so nicely made, as to point exactly according to its
Magnetick Direction, it would, in some certain Number of Years, describe
a Circle, of about 13 _gr._ Radius round the Magnetick Poles Northerly
and Southerly. This I have for several Years suspected, and have had
some Reason for it too, which I mentioned three or four Years ago at a
Meeting of our Royal Society, but I have not yet been so happy to procure
a tolerable good Dipping-Needle, or other proper one to my Mind, to bring
the Thing to sufficient Test of Experience; as in a short Time I hope to
do, having lately hit upon a Contrivance that may do the Thing.

[x] It is uncertain who was the Inventer of the Art of _Printing_, every
Historian ascribing the Honour thereof to his own City or Country.
Accordingly some ascribe the Invention of it to _John Guttenburg_, a
_Knight_ of _Argentine_, about 1440, and say, that _Faustus_ was only
his Assistant. _Bertius_ ascribes it to _Laurence John_, of _Harlem_,
and saith, _Fust_ or _Faust_, stole from him both his Art and Tools.
And to name no more, some attribute it to _John Fust_ or _Faust_, and
_Peter Schoeffer_ (called by _Fust_ in some of his _Imprimaturs_, _Pet.
de Gerneshem puer meus_.) But there is now to be seen at _Haerlem_, a
Book or two printed by _Lau. Kofter_, before any of these, _viz._ in
1430, and 1432. (_See Mr. ~Ellis~’s Letter to Dr. ~Tyson~_, in _Phil.
Trans._ Nᵒ. 286.) But be the first Inventer who it will, there is however
great Reason to believe, the Art receiv’d great improvements from
_Faust_ and his Son-in-Law _Schoeffer_, the latter being the Inventer of
metalline Types, which were cut in Wood before, first in whole Blocks,
and afterwards in single Types or Letters. See my learned Friend Mr.
_Wanley_’s Observations, in _Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ. 288, and 310.

[y] Concerning the Antiquity and Invention of _Clocks_ and _Clock Work_,
I refer the Reader to a little Book, called _the Artificial Clock-maker_,
chap. 6. Where there is some Account of the Ancients Inventions in
Clock-Work, as _Archimedes_’s _Sphere_, _Cresibius_’s _Clock_, _&c._

[z] The Invention of _Telescopes_, _Hieron. Syrturus_ gives this
Account of, _Prodiit_ Anno 1609, _Seu Genius, seu alter vir adhuc
incognitus, Hollandi specie, qui Middelburgi in Zelandiâ convenit Job.
Lippersein——Jussit perspicilla plura tam cava quam convexa, confeci.
Condicto die rediit, absolutum opus cupiens, atque ut statim habuit
præ manibus, bina suscipiens, cavum scil. & convexum, unum & alterum
oculo admovebat, & sensim dimovebat sive ut punctum concursûs, sive ut
artificis opus probaret, postea abiit. Artifex, ingenii minimè expers, &
novitatis curiosus cœpit idem facere & imitari, ~&c.~_ Vid. Mus. Worm. L.
4. c. 7.

[aa] Among the curious Inventions of the Ancients _Archytas_’s _Dove_
was much famed; of which _Aul. Gellius_ gives this Account: _Scripserunt
Simulachrum Columbæ è ligno ab Archytâ ratione quâdam disciplinâque
mechanicâ factum, volâsse: Ita erat scilicet libramentis suspensum, &
aurâ spiritûs inclusâ atque occultâ concitum._ Noct. Attic. L. 10. c. 12.
The same eminent _Pythagoræan_ Philosopher (as _Favorinus_ in _Gellius_
calls him) is by _Horace_ accounted a noble Geometrician too, _Te maris
& terræ, numeroque carentis arenæ Mensorum Archyta._ Among the rest of
his Inventions, _Children’s Rattles_ are ascribed to him. _Aristotle_
calls them Ἀρχύτου πλαταγὴ, _Polit._ 8. i.e. _Archytas_’s _Rattle_. And
_Diogenianus_ the Grammarian, gives the Reason of his Invention, Ἀρχύτου
πλαταγὴ ἐπὶ τῶν, &c. _That ~Archytas’s Rattle~ was to quiet Children; for
he having Children, contrived the Rattle, which he gave them to prevent
their [tumbling, διασαλεύσωσι] other Things about the House._

To these Contrivances of _Archytas_, we may add _Regiomontanus’s Wooden
Eagle, which flew forth of the City aloft in the Air, met the Emperor a
good Way off, coming towards it, and having saluted him, return’d again,
waiting on him to the City Gates_. Also his _Iron-fly_, which at a Feast
_flew forth off his Hands, and taking a Round, returned thither again_.
Vid. Hakewill ub. supr. c. 10. §. 1.

As to other Inventions of the Ancients, such as of Letters, Brick and
Tiles, and building Houses, with the Saw, Rule, and Plumber, the Lath,
Augre, Glue, _&c._ also the making Brass, Gold, and other Metals; the
use of Shields, Swords, Bows and Arrows, Boots, and other Instruments of
War; the Pipe, Harp, and other Musical Instruments; the building of Ships
and Navigation, and many other Things besides; the Inventors of these
(as reported by ancient Heathen Authors) may be plentifully met with in
_Plin. Nat. Hist._, L. 7. c. 56.

But in this Account of _Pliny_, we may observe whence the Ancients (even
the _Romans_ themselves in some measure) had their Accounts of these
Matters, _viz._ from the fabulous _Greeks_, who were fond of ascribing
every Thing to themselves. _The Truth is_ (saith the most learned Bishop
_Stillingfleet_) _there is nothing in the World useful or beneficial
to Mankind, but they have made a shift to find the Author of it among
themselves. If we enquire after the Original of Agriculture, we are
told of ~Ceres~ and ~Triptolemus~; if of Pasturage, we are told of an
~Arcadian Pan~; if of Wine, we presently hear of a ~Liber Pater~; if
of iron Instruments, then who but ~Vulcan~? if of Musick, none like to
~Apollo~. If we press them then with the History of other Nations, they
are as well provided here; if we enquire an Account of ~Europe~, ~Asia~,
or ~Libya~; for the first we are told a fine Story of ~Cadmus~’s Sister;
for the second of ~Prometheus~’s Mother of that Name; and for the third
of a Daughter of ~Epaphus~._ And so the learned Author goes on with other
particular Nations, which they boasted themselves to be the Founders of.
_Only the grave ~Athenians~ thought Scorn to have any Father assigned
them, their only Ambition was to be accounted ~Aborigines & genuini
Terræ~._ But the Ignorance and Vanity of the _Greek_ History, that
learned Author hath sufficiently refuted. _Vid._ _Stilling. Orig. Sacr._
Part. 1. B. 1. c. 4.

[bb] Whether _Printing_ was invented in 1440, as many imagine, or was
sooner practised, in 1430, or 1432, as Mr. _Ellis_’s Account of the
_Dutch_ Inscription in _Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 286. doth import; it is however
manifest, how great an Influence (as it was natural) this Invention had
in the promoting of Learning soon afterwards, mentioned before in _Note
(x)._ After which followed the Reformation about the Year 1517.

[cc] The _Chinese_ being much addicted to Judicial Astrology, are great
Observers of the Heavens, and the Appearances in them. For which Purpose
they have an _Observatory_ at _Pekin_, and five Mathematicians appointed
to watch every Night; four towards the four Quarters of the World, and
one towards the Zenith, that nothing may escape their Observation.
Which Observations are the next Morning brought to an Office to be
registred. But notwithstanding this their Diligence for many Ages, and
that the Emperor hath kept in his Service above 100 Persons to regulate
the Kalendar, yet are they such mean Astronomers, that they owe the
Regulation of their Kalendar, the Exactness in calculating Eclipses,
_&c._ to the _Europeans_; which renders the _European_ Mathematicians so
acceptable to the Emperor, that Father _Verbiest_ and divers others, were
not only made Principals in the Observatory, but put into Places of great
Trust in the Empire, and had the greatest Honours paid them at their
Deaths. _Vid._ _La Comte Mem. of China._ Letter 2d. _&c._

CHAP. II.

_Of Man’s BODY, particularly its POSTURE._


Having thus, as briefly as well I could, surveyed the _Soul_, let us next
take a View of _Man’s Body_. Now here we have such a Multiplicity of
the most exquisite Workmanship, and of the best Contrivance, that if we
should strictly survey the Body from Head to Foot, and search only into
the known Parts (and many more lie undiscovered) we should find too large
and tedious a Task to be dispatched. I shall therefore have Time only to
take a transient and general Kind of View of this admirable Machine, and
that somewhat briefly too, being prevented by others, particularly two
excellent Authors of our own[a], who have done it on the same Account as
my self. And the

I. Thing that presents itself to our View, is the _Erect Posture_[b] of
Man’s Body; which is far the most, if not the only commodious Posture for
a rational Creature, for him that hath Dominion over the other Creatures,
for one that can invent useful Things, and practise curious Arts. For
without this erect Posture, he could not have readily turned himself to
every Business, and on every Occasion. His Hand[c] particularly could
not have been in so great a Readiness to execute the Commands of the
Will, and Dictates of the Soul. His Eyes would have been the most prone,
and incommodiously situated of all Animals; but by this Situation, he
can cast his Eyes upwards, downwards, and round about him; he hath a
glorious Hemisphere of the Heavens[d], and an ample Horizon on Earth[e],
to entertain his Eye.

And as this Erection of Man’s Body is the most compleat Posture for
him; so if we survey the Provision made for it, we find all done with
manifest Design, the utmost Art and Skill being employ’d therein. To pass
by the particular Conformation of many of the Parts, the Ligaments and
Fastnings to answer this Posture; as the Fastning, for Instance, of the
_Pericardium_ to the _Diaphragm_, (which is peculiar to Man[f]; I say,
passing by a deal of this Nature, manifesting this Posture to be an Act
of Design,) let us stop a little at the curious Fabrick of the Bones,
those Pillars of the Body. And how artificially do we find them made,
how curiously plac’d from the Head to Foot! The _Vertebræ_ of the Neck
and Back-bone[g], made short and complanated, and firmly braced with
Muscles and Tendons, for easy Incurvations of the Body; but withal for
greater Strength, to support the Body’s own Weight, together with other
additional Weights it may have Occasion to bear. The _Thigh-bones_ and
Legs long, and strong, and every Way well fitted for the Motion of the
Body. The _Feet_ accommodated with a great Number of Bones, curiously
and firmly tack’d together, to which must be added the Ministry of the
Muscles[h], to answer all the Motions of the Legs and Thighs, and at the
same Time to keep the Body upright, and prevent its falling, by readily
assisting against every Vacillation thereof, and with easy and ready
Touches keeping the _Line of Innixion_, and _Center of Gravity_ in due
Place and Posture[i].

And as the Bones are admirably adapted to prop; so all the Parts of the
Body are as incomparably plac’d to poise it. Not one Side too heavy for
the other; but all in nice Æquipoise: The Shoulders, Arms, and Side
æquilibrated on one Part; on the other Part the _Viscera_ of the Belly
counterpois’d with the Weight of the scapular Part, and that useful
Cushion of Flesh behind.

And lastly, To all this we may add the wonderful Concurrence, and
Ministry of the prodigious Number and Variety of Muscles, plac’d
throughout the Body for this Service; that they should so readily answer
to every Posture; and comply with every Motion thereof, without any
previous Thought or Reflex act, so that (as the excellent _Borelli_[k]
saith), “It is worthy of Admiration, that in so great a Variety of
Motions, as running, leaping, and dancing, Nature’s Laws of Æquilibration
should always be observed; and when neglected, or wilfully transgressed,
that the Body must necessarily and immediately tumble down.”

potuit._

Of this Part, (and indeed of the other Parts of human Bodies) he gives
so good an Account, that I confess I could not but admire the Skill
of that ingenious and famed Heathen. For an Example, (because it is a
little out of the Way,) I shall pitch upon his Account of the different
Length of the Fingers, _L. 1. 2. 24._ The Reason of this Mechanism, he
saith, is, That the Tops of the Fingers may come to an Equality, _cùm
magnas aliquas moles in circuitu comprehendunt, & cùm in seipsis humidum
vel parvum corpus continere conantur.——Apparent verò in unam circuli
circumferentiam convenire Digiti quinque in actionibus hujusmodi maximè
quando exquisitè sphæricum corpus comprehendunt._ And this Evenness of
the Fingers Ends, in grasping sphærical, and other round Bodies, he truly
enough saith, makes the Hold the firmer. And it seems a noble and pious
Design he had in so strictly surveying the Parts of Man’s Body, which
take in his own translated Words, _Cùm multa namque esset apud veteres,
tam Medicos, quàm Philosophos de utilitate particularum dissensio (quidam
enim corpora nostra nullius gratiâ esse facta existimant, nullâque omnino

[e] If any should be so curious, to desire to know how far a Man’s
Prospect reacheth, by Means of the Height of his Eye, supposing the Earth
was an uninterrupted Globe; the Method is a common Case of right-angled
plain Triangles, where two Sides, and an opposite Angle are given: Thus
in Fig. 4. _A H B_ is the Surface, or a great Circle of the terraqueous
Globe; _C_ the Center, _H C_ its Semidiameter, _E_ the _Height_ of the
Eye; and foreasmuch as _H E_ is a Tangent, therefore the Angle at _H_ is
a right Angle: So that there are given _H C_ 398,386 Miles, or 21034781
_English_ Feet, (according to _Book II. Chap. 2. Note (a)_;) _C E_ the
same Length with the Height of the Eye, on the Mast of a Ship, or at only
a Man’s Height, _&c._ added to it; and _E H C_ the opposite right Angle.
By which three Parts given, it is easy to find all the other Parts of
the Triangle. And first, the Angle at _C_, in order to find the Side _H
E_, the Proportion is, As the Side _C E_, to the Angle at _H_; so the
Side _H C_, to the Angle at _E_, which being substracted out of 90 _gr._
the Remainder is the Angle at _C_. And then, As the Angle at _E_, is to
its opposite Side _H C_, or else as the Angle at _H_ is to its opposite
Side _C E_; so the Angle at _C_, to its opposite Side _E H_, the visible
Horizon. Or the Labour may be shortned, by adding together the Logarithm
of the Sum of the two given Sides, and the Logarithm of their Difference;
the half of which two Logarithms, is the Logarithm of the Side requir’d,
nearly. For an Example, We will take the two Sides in Yards, by Reason
scarce any Table of Logarithms will serve us farther. The Semidiameter of
the Earth is 7011594 Yards; the Height of the Eye is two Yards more, the
Sum of both Sides, is 14023190.

  Logar. of which Sum is,               7,1468468
  Logar. of two Yards (the Differ.) is, 0,3010300
                                        ---------
  Sum of both Logar.                    7,4478768
                                        ---------
  The half Sum,                         3,7239384

is the Logar. of 5296 Yards = three Miles, which is the Length of the
Line _E H_, or Distance the Eye can reach at six Feet Height.

This would be the Distance, on a perfect Globe, did the visual Rays come
to the Eye in a strait Line; but by Means of the Refractions of the
Atmosphere, distant Objects on the Horizon, appear higher than really
they are, and may be seen at a greater Distance, especially on the
Sea; which is a Matter of great Use, especially to discover at Sea the
Land, Rocks, _&c._ and it is a great Act of the divine Providence, in
the Contrivance and Convenience of the Atmosphere, which by this Means
enlargeth the visible Horizon, and is all one, as if the terraqueous
Globe was much larger than really it is. As to the Height of the Apparent
above the true Level, or how much distant Objects are rais’d by the
Refractions, the ingenious and accurate Gentlemen of the _French Academy
Royal_, have given us a Table in their _Measure of the Earth_, Art. 12.

[h] The Mechanism of the Foot, would appear to be wonderful, if I should
descend to a Description of all its Parts; but that would be too long
for these Notes; therefore a brief Account, (most of which I owe to
the before-commended Mr. _Cheselden_,) may serve for a Sample: In the
first Place, It is necessary the Foot should be concave, to enable us
to stand firm, and that the Nerves and Blood-Vessels may be free from
Compression when we stand or walk. In order hereunto, the long _Flexors_
of the Toes cross one another at the Bottom of the Foot, in the Form of a
St. _Andrew_’s Cross, to incline the lesser Toes towards the great One,
and the great One towards the lesser. The _short Flexors_ are chiefly
concern’d in drawing the Toes towards the Heel. The _transversalis Pedis_
draws the Outsides of the Foot towards each other; and by being inserted
into one of the _sesamoid_ Bones, of the great Toe, diverts the Power
of the _abductor Muscle_, (falsly so call’d,) and makes it become a
_Flexor_. And lastly, the _peronæus Longus_ runs round the outer Ankle,
and obliquely forwards cross the Bottom of the Foot, and at once helps
to extend the _Tarsus_, to constrict the Foot, and to direct the Power
of the other _Extensors_ towards the Ball of the great Toe: Hence the
Loss of the _great Toe_, is more than of all the other Toes. See also Mr.
_Cowper_’s _Anat._ Tab. 28. _&c._

[i] It is very well worth while to compare here what _Borelli_ saith, _de

_Of the FIGURE and SHAPE of Man’s BODY._


The Figure and Shape of Man’s Body, is the most commodious that could
possibly be invented for such an Animal; the most agreeable to his
Motion, to his Labours, and all his Occasions. For had he been a rational
Reptile, he could not have moved from Place to Place fast enough for
his Business, nor indeed have done any almost. Had he been a rational
Quadrupede, among other Things, he had lost the Benefit of his Hands,
those noble Instruments of the most useful Performances of the Body.
Had he been made a Bird, besides many other great Incoveniencies, those
before-mentioned of his Flying would have been some. In a word, any other
Shape of Body, but that which the All-wise Creator hath given Man, would
have been as incommodious, as any Posture but that of erect; it would
have rendered him more helpless, or have put it in his Power to have been
more pernicious, or deprived him of Ten thousand Benefits, or Pleasures,
or Conveniences, which his present Figure capacitates him for.




CHAP. IV.

_Of the STATURE and SIZE of Man’s BODY._


As in the Figure, so in the Stature and Size of Man’s Body, we have
another manifest Indication of excellent Design. Not too Pygmean[a],
nor too Gigantick[b], either of which Sizes would in some particular
or other, have been incommodious to Himself, or to his Business, or
to the rest of his Fellow-Creatures. Too Pygmean would have rendered
him too puny a Lord of the Creation; too impotent and unfit to manage
the inferiour Creatures, would have exposed him to the Assaults of the
weakest Animals, to the ravening Appetite of voracious Birds, and have
put him in the Way, and endangered his being trodden in the Dirt by the
larger Animals. He would have been also too weak for his Business, unable
to carry Burdens, and in a word, to transact the greater part of his
Labours and Concerns.

And on the other hand, had Man’s Body been made too monstrously strong,
too enormously Gigantick[c], it would have rendered him a dangerous
Tyrant in the World, too strong[d] in some Respects, even for his own
Kind, as well as the other Creatures. Locks and Doors might perhaps
have been made of sufficient Strength to have barricaded our Houses; and
Walls, and Ramparts might perhaps have been made strong enough to have
fenced our Cities. But these Things could not have been without a great
and inconvenient Expence of Room, Materials, and such Necessaries, as
such vast Structures and Uses would have occasioned; more perhaps than
the World could have afforded to all Ages and Places. But let us take the
Descant of a good Naturalist and Physician on the Case[e]. “Had Man been
a Dwarf (said he) he had scarce been a reasonable Creature. For he must
then have had a Jolt Head; so there would not have been Body and Blood
enough to supply his Brain with Spirits; or he must have had a small
Head, answerable to his Body, and so there would not have been Brain
enough for his Business—Or had the Species of Mankind been Gigantick, he
could not have been so commodiously supplied with Food. For there would
not have been Flesh enough of the best edible Beasts, to serve his Turn.
And if Beasts had been made answerably bigger, there would not have been
Grass enough.” And so he goeth on. And a little after, “There would not
have been the same Use and Discovery of his Reason; in that he would have
done many Things by mere Strength, for which he is now put to invent
innumerable Engines—. Neither could he have used an Horse, nor divers
other Creatures. But being of a middle Bulk, he is fitted to manage and
use them all. For (saith he) no other cause can be aligned why a Man was
not made five or ten Times bigger, but his Relation to the rest of the
Universe.” Thus far our curious Author.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] What is here urged about the Size of Man’s Body, may answer one of
_Lucretius_’s Reasons why _Nil ex nihilo gignitur_. His Argument is

  _Denique cur Homines ramos natura parare_
  _Non potuit, pedibus qui pontum per vada possent_
  _Transire, & magnos manibus divellere monteis?_

                          Lucret. _L. 1. Carm. 200._

[b] _Haud facile fit ut quisquam & ingentes corporis vires, & ingenium
subtile habeat._ Diodor. Sic. L. 17.

[c] Altho’ we read of _Giants_ before _Noah_’s Flood, _Gen._ vi. 4. and
more plainly afterwards in _Numb._ xiii. 33. Yet there is great Reason to
think the Size of Man was always the same from the Creation. For as to
the _Nephilim_ or _Giants_, in _Gen._ vi. the Ancients vary about them;
some taking them for great Atheists, and Monsters of Impiety, Rapine,
Tyranny, and all Wickedness, as well as of monstrous Stature, according
as indeed the _Hebrew_ Signification allows.

And as for the _Nephilim_ in _Numb._ xiii. which were evidently Men of
a Gigantick Size, it must be considered, that it is very probable, the
Fears and Discontentments of the Spies might add somewhat thereunto.

But be the Matter as it will, it is very manifest, that in both these
Places, _Giants_ are spoken of as Rarities, and Wonders of the Age,
not of the common Stature. And such Instances we have had in all
Ages; excepting some fabulous Relations; such as I take to be that of
_Theutobotchus_, who is said to have been dug up, _Anno_ 1613, and to
have been higher than the Trophies, and 26 Feet long; and no better I
suppose the Giants to have been, that _Ol. Magnus_ gives an Account
of in his 5ᵗʰ Book, such as _Harthen_, and _Starchater_, among the
Men; and among the Women, _reperta est_ (saith he) _puella——in capite
vulnerata, ac mortua, induta chlamyde purpureâ, longitudinis cubitorum
50, latitudinis inter humeros quatuor._ Ol. Mag. Hist. L. 5. c. 2.

But as for the more credible Relations of _Goliath_ (_whose height was 6
Cubits and a Span_, 1 Sam. xvii. 4. which according to the late curious
and learned _Lord Bishop of ~Peterborough~_ is somewhat above 11 Feet
_English_, _vid._ Bishop _Cumberland of Jewish Weights and Measures_) of
_Maximinus_ the Emperor, who was 9 Feet high, and others in _Augustus_,
and other Reigns, of about the same Height: To which we may add the
Dimensions of a _Skeleton_, dug up lately in the Place of a _Roman_ Camp
near St. _Albans_, by an Urn inscribed, _Marcus Antoninus_; of which an
Account is given by Mr. _Cheselden_, who judgeth by the Dimensions of the
Bones, that the Person was 8 Foot high, _vid._ _Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ. 333.
These antique Examples and Relations, I say, we can match, yea, out-do,
with modern Examples; of which we have divers in _J. Ludolph. Comment. in
Hist. Æthiop._ L. 1. c. 2. §. 22. _Magus_, _Conringius_, Dr. _Hakewill_,
and others. Which later relates from _Nannez_, of Porters and Archers
belonging to the Emperor of _China_, of 15 Feet high; and others from
_Purchas_, of 10 and 12 Feet high, and more. See the learned Author’s
_Apolog._ p. 208.

These indeed exceed what I have seen in _England_; but in 1684, I my self
measur’d an _Irish_ Youth, said to be not 19 Years old, who was 7 Feet
near 8 Inches, and in 1697, a Woman who was 7 Feet 3 inches in Height.

But for the ordinary size of Mankind, in all Probability, it was always
(as I said) the same, as may appear from the Monuments, Mummies, and
other ancient Evidences to be seen at this Day. The most ancient Monument
at this Day, I presume is that of _Cheops_, in the first and fairest
Pyramid of _Ægypt_; which was, no doubt, made of Capacity every Way
sufficient to hold the Body of so great a Person as was intended to be
laid up in it. But this we find by the nice Measures of our curious Mr.
_Greaves_, hardly to exceed our common Coffins. _The hollow Part within_
(saith he) _is in Length ~only~ 6,488 Feet, ~and~ in Breadth ~but~ 2,218
Feet: The Depth 2,860 Feet. A narrow space, yet large enough to contain a
most potent and dreadful Monarch, being dead; to whom living, all ~Ægypt~
was too streight and narrow a Circuit. By these Dimensions, and by such
other Observations, as have been taken by me from several embalmed Bodies
in ~Ægypt~, we may conclude there is no decay in Nature (though the
Question is as old as ~Homer~) but that the Men of this Age are of the
same Stature they were near 3000 Years ago_, vid. _Greaves_ of the Pyr.
in 1638, in Ray’s Collect. of _Trav._ Tom. 1. pag. 118.

To this more ancient, we may add others of a later Date. Of which take
these, among others, from the curious and learned _Hakewill_. The Tombs
at _Pisa_, that are some thousand Years old, are not longer than ours; so
is _Athelstane_’s in _Malmesbury_-Church; so _Sehba_’s in St. _Paul_’s,
of the Year 693; so _Etheldred_’s, &c. Apol. 216, _&c._

The same Evidence we have also from the Armour, Shields, Vessels, and
other Utensils dug up at this Day. The Brass Helmet dug up at _Metaurum_,
which was not doubted to have been left there at the _Overthrow of
Asdrubal_, will fit one of our Men at this Day.

Nay, besides all this, probably we have some more certain Evidence.
_Augustus_ was 5 Foot 9 Inches high, which was the just Measure of our
famous Queen _Elizabeth_, who exceeded his Height 2 Inches, if proper
Allowance be made for the Difference between the _Roman_ and our Foot.
_Vid._ _Hakew. ib. p. 215._

[d] To the Stature of Men in the foregoing Note, we may add some Remarks
about their unusual _Strength_. That of _Sampson_ (who is not said to
have exceeded other Men in Stature as he did in Strength) is well known.
So of old, _Hector_, _Diomedes_, _Hercules_, and _Ajax_ are famed; and
since them many others; for which I shall seek no farther than the
before commended _Hakewill_, who by his great and curious Learning, hath
often most of the Examples that are to be met with on all his Subjects
he undertakes. Of the After-Ages he names _C. Marius_, _Maximinus_,
_Aurelian_, _Scanderberge_, _Bardesin_, _Tamerlane_, _Siska_, and
_Hunniades_. Anno 1529, _Klunher_, Provost of the great Church at
_Misnia_, carry’d a Pipe of Wine out of the Cellar, and laid it in the
Cart. _Mayolus_ saw one hold a Marble Pillar in his Hand 3 Foot long, and
1 Foot diameter, which he toss’d up in the Air, and catched again, as if
it were a Ball. Another of _Mantua_, and a little Man, named _Rodamas_,
could break a Cable, _&c._ _Ernando Burg_, fetched up Stairs an Ass laden
with Wood, and threw both into the Fire. At _Constantinople_, _Anno
1582_, one lifted a Piece of Wood, that twelve Men could scarce raise:
then lying along, he bare a Stone that ten Men could but just roll to
him. _G._ of _Fronsberge_, Baron _Mindlehaim_, could raise a Man off his
Seat, with only his middle Finger; stop an Horse in his full Career; and
shove a Cannon out of its Place. _Cardan_ saw a Man dance with two Men in
his Arms, two on his Shoulders, and one on his Neck. _Patacoua_, Captain
of the _Cossacks_, could tear an Horse-Shoe (and if I mistake not, the
same is reported of the present King _Augustus_ of _Poland_.) A Gigantick
Woman of the _Netherlands_ could lift a Barrel of _Hamburgh_ Beer. Mr.
_Carew_ had a Tenant that could carry a But’s Length, 6 Bushel of Wheaten
Meal (of 15 Gallon Measure) with the Lubber, the Miller of 24 Years of
Age, on the top of it. And _J. Roman_ of the same County, could carry the
Carcass of an Ox. Vid. _Hakewill_, ib. p. 238.

_Of the STRUCTURE of the PARTS of Man’s Body._


Having thus taken a View of the Posture, Shape, and Size of Man’s Body,
let us in this Chapter survey the Structure of its Parts. But here we
have so large a Prospect, that it would be endless to proceed upon
Particulars. It must suffice therefore to take Notice, in general only,
how artificially every Part of our Body is made. No Botch, no Blunder,
no unnecessary _Apparatus_ (or in other Words) no Signs of Chance[a];
but every Thing curious, orderly, and performed in the shortest and best
Method, and adapted to the most compendious Use. What one Part is there
throughout the whole Body, but what is composed of the fittest Matter
for that Part; made of the most proper Strength and Texture; shaped
in the compleatest Form; and in a word, accouter’d with every Thing
necessary for its Motion, Office, Nourishment, Guard, and what not!
What so commodious a Structure and Texture could have been given to the
Bones, for Instance, to make them firm and strong, and withal light, as
that which every Bone in the Body hath? Who could have shaped them so
nicely to every Use, and adapted them to every Part, made them of such
just Lengths, given them such due Sizes and Shapes, chanelled, hollowed,
headed, lubricated, and every other Thing ministring, in the best and
most compendious manner to their several Places and Uses? What a glorious
Collection and Combination have we also of the most exquisite Workmanship
and Contrivance in the Eye, in the Ear, in the Hand[b], in the Foot[c],
in the Lungs, and other Parts already mention’d? What an Abridgment of
Art, what a Variety of Uses[d], hath Nature laid upon that one Member
of the Tongue, the grand Instrument of Taste, the faithful Judge, the
Centinel, the Watchman of all our Nourishment, the artful Modulator of
our Voice, the necessary Servant of Mastication, Swallowing, Sucking, and
a great deal besides? But I must desist from proceeding upon Particulars,
finding I am fallen upon what I propos’d to avoid.

And therefore for a Close of this Chapter, I shall only add Part of a
Letter I receiv’d from the before-commended very curious and ingenious
Physician Dr. _Tancred Robinson_, _What_, (saith he,) _can possibly be
better contriv’d for animal Motion and Life, than the quick Circulation
of the Blood and Fluids, which run out of Sight in capillary Vessels, and
very minute Ducts, without Impediment, (except in some Diseases,) being
all directed to their peculiar Glands and Chanels, for the different
Secretion, sensible and insensible; whereof the last is far the greatest
in Quantity and Effects, as to Health and Sickness, acute Distempers
frequently arising from a Diminution of Transpiration, through the
cutaneous Chimneys, and some chronical Ones from an Augmentation: Whereas
Obstructions in the Liver, Pancreas, and other Glands, may only cause a
Schirrus, a Jaundice, an Ague, a Dropsy, or other slow Diseases. So an
Increase of that Secretion may accompany the general Colliquations, as
in Fluxes, hectick Sweats and Coughs, Diabetes, and other Consumptions.
What a mighty Contrivance is there to preserve these due Secretions from
the Blood, (on which Life so much depends,) by frequent Attritions, and
Communications of the Fluids in their Passage through the Heart, the
Lungs, and the whole System of the Muscles? What Mæanders and Contortions
of Vessels, in the Organs of Separation? And, What a Concourse of
elastick Bodies from the Air, to supply the Springs, and continual
Motions of some Parts, not only in Sleep, and Rest; but in long violent
Exercises of the Muscles? Whose Force drive the Fluids round in a
wonderful rapid Circulation through the minutest Tubes, assisted by the
constant Pabulum of the Atmosphere, and their own elastick Fibres, which
impress that Velocity on the Fluids._

_Now I have mention’d some Uses of the Air, in carrying on several
Functions in animal Bodies; I may add the Share it hath in all the
Digestions of the solid and fluid Parts. For when this System of Air
comes, by divine Permittance, to be corrupted with poysonous, acrimonious
Steams, either from the Earth, from Merchandise, or infected Bodies,
What Havock is made in all the Operations of living Creatures? The Parts
gangrene, and mortify under Carbuncles, and other Tokens: Indeed, the
whole animal Oeconomy is ruin’d; of such Importance is the Air to all the
parts of it._ Thus my learned Friend.

FOOTNOTES:

[a] It is manifestly an Argument of Design, that in the Bodies of
different Animals, there is an Agreement of the Parts, so far as the
Occasions and Offices agree, but a difference of those, where there is a
difference of these. In an Human Body are many Parts agreeing with those
of a Dog for Instance; but in his Forehead, Fingers, Hand, Instruments
of Speech, and many other Parts, there are Muscles, and other Members
which are not in a Dog. And so contrariwise in a Dog, which is not in a
Man. If the Reader is minded to see what particular Muscles are in a Man,
that are not in a Dog; or in a Dog that are not in an Humane Body, let
him consult the curious and accurate Anatomist Dr. _Douglass_’s _Myogr.

[c] And not only in the Hand, but in his Account of the Foot (_L. 3._)
he frequently takes notice of what he calls _Artem, Providentiam &
Sapientiam Conditoris_. As Ch. 13. _An igitur non equum est hìc quoque

contrarium, exactè convenientes & consentientes invicem fabricatus est

CHAP. VI.

_Of the PLACING the PARTS of Man’s Body._


In this Chapter, I propose to consider the Lodgment of the curious Parts
of Man’s Body, which is no less admirable than the Parts themselves, all
set in the most convenient Places of the Body, to minister to their own
several Uses and Purposes, and assist, and mutually to help one another.
Where could those faithful Watchmen the Eye, the Ear, the Tongue, be so
commodiously plac’d, as in the upper Part of the Building? Where could
we throughout the Body find so proper a Part to lodge four of the five
Senses, as in the Head[a], near the Brain[b], the common Sensory, a
Place well guarded, and of little other Use than to be a Seat to those
Senses? And, How could we lodge the fifth Sense, that of _Touching_
otherwise[c], than to disperse it to all Parts of the Body? Where could
we plant the Hand[d], but just where it is, to be ready at every Turn,
on all Occasions of Help and Defence, of Motion, Action, and every of
its useful Services? Where could we set the Legs and Feet, but where
they are, to bear up, and handsomely to carry about the Body? Where
could we lodge the Heart, to labour about the whole Mass of Blood, but
in, or near the Center of the Body[e]? Where could we find Room for that
noble Engine to play freely in? Where could we so well guard it against
external Harms, as it is in that very Place in which it is lodg’d and
secur’d? Where could we more commodiously Place, than in the Thorax and
Belly, the useful _Viscera_ of those Parts, so as not to swag, and jog,
and over-set the Body, and yet to minister so harmoniously, as they do,
to all the several Uses of Concoction, Sanguification, the Separation of
various Ferments from the Blood, for the great Uses of Nature, and to
make Discharges of what is useless, or would be burdensome or pernicious
to the Body[f]? How could we plant the curious and great Variety of
Bones, and of Muscles, of all Sorts and Sizes, necessary, as I have said,
to the Support, and every Motion of the Body? Where could we lodge all
the Arteries and Veins, to convey Nourishment; and the Nerves, Sensation
throughout the Body? Where, I say, could we lodge all these Implements
of the Body, to perform their several Offices? How could we secure and
guard them so well, as in the very Places, and in the self same Manner
in which they are already plac’d in the Body? And lastly, to name no
more, What Covering, what Fence could we find out for the whole Body,
better than that of Nature’s own providing, the Skin[g]? How could we
shape it to, or brace it about every Part better, either for Convenience
or Ornament? What better Texture could we give it, which although less
obdurate and firm, than that of some other Animals; yet is so much the
more sensible of every touch, and more compliant with every Motion?
And being easily defensible by the Power of Man’s Reason and Art, is
therefore much the properest Tegument for a reasonable Creature.

are soft and tender; and that for this Reason it is, that four of the

_Of the PROVISION in Man’s Body against EVILS._


Having taking a transient View of the Structure, and Lodgment of the
Parts of human Bodies; let us next consider the admirable Provision that
is made throughout Man’s Body, to stave off Evils, and to discharge[a]
them when befallen. For the Prevention of Evils, we may take the
Instances already given, of the Situation of those faithful Sentinels,
the Eye, the Ear, and Tongue, in the superiour Part of the Body, the
better to descry Dangers at a Distance, and to call out presently for
Help. And how well situated is the Hand to be a sure and ready Guard to
the Body, as well as the faithful Performer of most of its Services?
The Brain, the Nerves, the Arteries, the Heart[b], the Lungs; and in a
Word, all the principal Parts, how well are they barricaded, either with
strong Bones, or deep Lodgments in the Flesh, or some such the wisest,
and fittest Method, most agreeable to the Office and Action of the Part?
Besides which, for greater Precaution, and a farther Security, what an
incomparable Provision hath the infinite Contriver of Man’s Body made for
the Loss of, or any Defect in some of the Parts we can least spare, by
doubling them? By giving us two Eyes, two Ears, two Hands, two Kidneys,
two Lobes of the Lungs, Pairs of the Nerves, and many Ramifications of
the Arteries and Veins in the fleshy Parts, that there may not be a
Defect of Nourishment of the Parts, in Cases of Amputation, or Wounds, or
Ruptures of any of the Vessels.

And as Man’s Body is admirably contriv’d, and made to prevent Evils; so
no less Art and Caution hath been us’d to get rid of them, when they do
happen. When by any Misfortune, Wounds or Hurts do befal; or when by
our own wicked Fooleries and Vices, we pull down Diseases and Mischiefs
upon our selves, what Emunctories[c], what admirable Passages[d], are
dispers’d throughout the Body; what incomparable Methods doth Nature
take[e]; what vigorous Efforts is she enabled to make, to discharge the
peccant Humours, to correct the morbifick Matter; and in a Word, to set
all Things right again? But here we had best take the Advice of a learned
Physician in the Case: “The Body, (saith he,) is so contriv’d, as to be
well enough secur’d against the Mutations in the Air, and the lesser
Errors we daily run upon; did we not in the Excesses of Eating, Drinking,
Thinking, Loving, Hating, or some other Folly, let in the Enemy, or lay
violent Hands upon our selves. Nor is the Body fitted only to prevent;
but also to cure, or mitigate Diseases, when by these Follies brought
upon us. In most Wounds, if kept clean, and from the Air,——the Flesh
will glew together, with its own native Balm. Broken Bones are cemented
with the _Callus_, which themselves help to make”. And so he goes on
with ample Instances in this Matter, too many to be here specify’d[f].
Among which he instanceth in the Distempers of our Bodies, shewing that
even many of them are highly serviceable to the Discharge of malignant
Humours, and preventing greater Evils.

And no less kind than admirable is this Contrivance of Man’s Body,
that even its Distempers should many Times be its Cure[g]; that when
the Enemy lies lurking within to destroy us, there should be such a
Reluctancy, and all Nature excited with its utmost Vigour to expel him
thence. To which Purpose, even Pain it self is of great and excellent
Use, not only in giving us Notice of the Presence of the Enemy, but
by exciting us to use our utmost Diligence and Skill to root out so
troublesome and destructive a Companion.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] One of Nature’s most constant Methods here, is by the _Glands_, and
the _Secretions_ made by them; the Particulars of which being too long
for these Notes, I shall refer to the modern Anatomists, who have written
on these Subjects; and indeed, who are the only Men that have done it
tolerably: Particularly, our learned Drs. _Cockburn_, _Keil_, _Morland_,
and others at Home and Abroad: An Abridgment of whose Opinions and
Observations, for the Reader’s Ease, may be met with in Dr. _Harris_’s
_Lex. Tech._ Vol. 2. under the Words _Glands_, and _Animal Secretion_.

[b] In Man, and most other Animals, the Heart hath the Guard of Bones;
but in the _Lamprey_, which hath no Bones, (no not so much as a
Back-bone,) _the Heart is very strangely secur’d, and lies immur’d, or
capsulated in a Cartilage, or grisly Substance, which includes the Heart,
and its Auricle, as the Skull——doth the Brain in other Animals_. _Powers_

[c] _Here ~[from the Pustules he observ’d in Monomotapa]~ were Grounds
to admire the Contrivance of our Blood, which on some Occasions, so
soon as any Thing destructive to the Constitution of it, comes into it,
immediately by an intestine Commotion, endeavoureth to thrust it forth,
and is not only freed from the new Guest; but sometimes what likewise
may have lain lurking therein——for a great while. And from hence it
comes to pass, that most Part of Medicines, when duly administred, are
not only sent out of the body themselves; but likewise great Quantities
of morbifick Matter: As in Salivation_, &c. Dr. _Sloane_’s Voy. to
_Jamaica_, p. 25.

[d] _Valsalva_ discover’d some Passages into the Region of the
_Ear-drum_, of mighty Use, (among others,) to make Discharges of Bruises,
Imposthumes, or any purulent, or morbifick Matter from the Brain, and
Parts of the Head. Of which he gives two Examples: One, a Person, who
from a Blow on his Head, had dismal Pains therein, grew Speechless, and
lay under an absolute Suppression and Decay of his Strength; but found
certain Relief, whenever he had a Flux of Blood, or purulent Matter out
of his Ear; which after his Death _Valsalva_ discover’d, was through
those Passages.

The other was an _apoplectical Case_, wherein he found a large Quantity
of extravasated Blood, making Way from the Ventricles of the Brain,
through those same Passages. _Valsal. de Aure hum._ c. 2. §. 14. and c.
5. §. 8.

[e] _Hippocrates Lib. de Alimentis_, takes notice of the Sagacity of
Nature, in finding out Methods and Passages for the discharging Things
offensive to the Body, of which the late learned and ingenious Bishop
of _Clogher_, in _Ireland_, (_Boyle_,) gave this remarkable Instance,
to my very curious and ingenious Neighbour and Friend, _D’Acre Barret_,
Esq; _viz._ That in the Plague Year, a Gentleman at the University, had
a large Plague Sore gather’d under his Arm, which, when they expected
it would have broken, discharg’d it self by a more than ordinary large
and fœtid Stool; the Sore having no other Vent for it, and immediately
becoming sound and well thereon.

Like to which, is the Story of _Jos. Lazonius_, of a Soldier of thirty
five Years of Age, who had a Swelling in his right Hip, accompany’d with
great Pain, _&c._ By the Use of emollient Medicines, having ripen’d the
Sore, the Surgeon intended the next Day to have open’d it; but about
Midnight, the Patient having great Provocations to stool, disburthen’d
himself three Times; immediately upon which, both the Tumor and Pain
ceas’d, and thereby disappointed the Surgeon’s Intentions. _Ephem.
Germ._ Anno 1690. Obs. 49. More such Instances we find of Mr. _Tonges_
in _Philos. Transact._ Nᵒ. 323. But indeed there are so many Examples
of this Nature in our _Phil. Trans._ in the _Ephem. German. Tho.
Bartholine_, _Rhodius_, _Sennertus_, _Hildanus_, &c. that it would be
endless to recount them. Some have swallow’d Knives, Bodkins, Needles
and Pins, Bullets, Pebbles, and twenty other such Things as could not
find a Passage the ordinary Way, but have met with an _Exit_ through the
Bladder, or some other Way of Nature’s own providing. But passing over
many Particulars, I shall only give one instance more, because it may
be a good Caution to some Persons, that these Papers may probably fall
into the Hands of; and that is, The Danger of swallowing _Plum-stones_,
_Prune-stones_, &c. Sir _Francis Butler_’s Lady had many _Prune-stones_
that made Way through an Abscess near her Navel. _Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ.
165. where are other such like Examples. More also may be found in Nᵒ.
282, 304, _&c._ And at this Day, a young Man, living not far off me,
laboureth under very troublesome and dangerous Symptoms, from the Stones
of _Sloes_ and _Bullace_, which he swallow’d eight or ten Years ago.

heterogeneous Mixtures; and Nature, the Disease, and Remedies, clean all
the Rooms of the House; whereby that which threatens Death, tends, in
Conclusion, to the prolonging of Life._ Grew ubi supr. §. 52.

And as Diseases minister sometimes to Health; so to other good Uses in
the Body, such as quickning the Senses: Of which take these Instances
relating to the Hearing and Sight.

_A very ingenious Physician falling into an odd Kind of Fever, had his
Sense of Hearing thereby made so very nice and tender, that he very
plainly heard soft Whispers, that were made at a considerable Distance
off, and which were not in the least perceiv’d by the Bystanders, nor
would have been by him before his Sickness._

Eyes, had his Organs of Sight brought to be so tender, that both his

CHAP. VIII.

_Of the ~Consent~ between the PARTS of Man’s Body._


It is an admirable Provision the merciful Creator hath made for the Good
of Man’s Body, by the Consent and Harmony between the Parts thereof: Of
which let us take St. _Paul_’s Description, in 1 _Cor._ xii. 8. _But
now hath God set the Members, every one of them in the Body, as it hath
pleas’d him._ And (℣. 21) _The Eye cannot say unto the Hand, I have no
need of thee: Nor again, the Head to the Feet, I have no need of you._
But such is the Consent of all the Parts, or as the Apostle wordeth it,
_God hath so temper’d the Body together, that the Members should have the
same Care one for another_, ℣. 25. So that _whether one Member suffer,
all the Members suffer with it; or one Member be honoured_, (or affected
with any Good,) _all the Members rejoyce_, [and sympathize] _with it_, ℣.
26.

This mutual Accord, Consent and Sympathy of the Members, there is no
Reason to doubt[a], is made by the Commerce of the Nerves[b], and their
artificial Positions, and curious Ramifications throughout the whole
Body, which is admirable and incomparable, and might deserve a Place in
this Survey, as greatly, and manifestly setting forth the Wisdom and
Benignity of the great Creator; but that to give a Description thereof
from the Origin of the Nerves, in the _Brain_, the _Cerebellum_ and
_Spine_, and so through every Part of the Body, would be tedious, and
intrench too much upon the Anatomist’s Province: And therefore one
Instance shall suffice for a Sample of the Whole; and that shall be,
(what was promis’d before[c]), the great Sympathy occasion’d by the
_fifth Pair_ of Nerves; which I chuse to instance in, rather than the
_Par vagum_, or any other of the Nerves; because although we may have
less variety of noble Contrivance and Art, than in that Pair; yet we
shall find enough for our Purpose, and which may be dispatch’d in fewer
Words. Now this _fifth Conjugation_ of _Nerves_, is branch’d to the Ball,
the Muscles, and Glands of the Eye; to the Ear; to the Jaws, the Gums,
and Teeth; to the Muscles of the Lips[d]; to the Tonsils, the Palate,
the Tongue, and the Parts of the Mouth; to the _Præcordia_ also, in some
Measure, by inosculating with one of its Nerves; and lastly, to the
Muscles of the Face, particularly the Cheeks, whose sanguiferous Vessels
it twists about.

From hence it comes to pass, that there is a great Consent and
Sympathy[e] between these Parts; so that a gustable Thing seen or smelt,
excites the Appetite, and affects the Glands and Parts of the Mouth;
that a Thing seen or heard, that is shameful, affects the Cheeks with
modest Blushes; but on the contrary, if it pleases and tickles the
Fancy, that it affects the _Præcordia_, and Muscles of the Mouth and
Face with Laughter; but a Thing causing Sadness and Melancholy, doth
accordingly exert it self upon the _Præcordia_, and demonstrate it self
by causing the Glands of the Eyes to emit Tears[f], and the Muscles
of the Face to put on the sorrowful Aspect of Crying. Hence also that
torvous sour Look produc’d by Anger and Hatred: And that gay and pleasing
Countenance accompanying Love and Hope. And in short, it is by Means of
this Communication of the Nerves, that whatever affects the Soul, is
demonstrated, (whether we will or no,) by a consentaneous Disposition
of the _Præcordia_ within, and a suitable Configuration of the Muscles
and Parts of the Face without. And an admirable Contrivance of the
great GOD of _Nature_ this is; That as a Face is given to Man, and as
_Pliny_ saith[g], to Man alone of all Creatures; so it should be, (as
he observes,) _the Index of Sorrow and Chearfulness, of Compassion and
Severity. In its ascending Part is the Brow, and therein a Part of the
Mind too. Therewith we deny, therewith we consent. With this it is we
shew our Pride, which hath its Source in another Place; but here its
Seat: In the Heart it hath its Birth; but here it abides and dwells; and
that because it could find no other Part throughout the Body higher, or
more craggy[h], where it might reside alone._

Thus I have dispatch’d what I shall remark concerning the Soul and Body
of Man. There are divers other Things, which well deserve a Place in
this Survey; and these that I have taken Notice of, deserv’d to have
been enlarg’d upon: But what hath been said, may suffice for a Taste and
Sample of this admirable Piece of God’s Handy-work; at least serve as a
Supplement to what others have said before me. For which Reason I have
endeavour’d to say as little wittingly as I could, of what they have
taken Notice of, except where the Thread of my Discourse laid a Necessity
upon me.

_Of the Variety of Mens FACES, VOICES, and HAND-WRITING._


Here I would have put an End to my Observations relating to Man; but
that there are three Things so expressly declaring the Divine Management
and Concurrence, that I shall just mention them, although taken Notice
of more amply by others; and that is, The great Variety throughout the
World of Mens Faces[a], Voices[b], and Hand-writing. Had Man’s Body been
made according to any of the atheistical Schemes, or any other Method
than that of the infinite Lord of the World, this wise Variety would
never have been: But Mens Faces would have been cast in the same, or
not a very different Mould, their Organs of Speech would have sounded
the same, or not so great a Variety of Notes; and the same Structure
of Muscles and Nerves, would have given the Hand the same Direction
in Writing. And in this Case, what Confusion, what Disturbance, what
Mischiefs would the World eternally have lain under? No Security
could have been to our Persons; no Certainty, no Enjoyment of our
Possessions[c]; no Justice between Man and Man; no Distinction between
Good and Bad, between Friends and Foes, between Father and Child, Husband
and Wife, Male or Female; but all would have been turn’d topsey-turvey,
by being expos’d to the Malice of the Envious and Ill-natur’d, to the
Fraud and Violence of Knaves and Robbers, to the Forgeries of the
crafty Cheat, to the Lusts of the Effeminate and Debauch’d, and what
not! Our Courts of Justice[d], can abundantly testify the dire Effects
of mistaking Men’s Faces, of counterfeiting their Hands, and forging
Writings. But now, as the infinitely wise Creator and Ruler hath order’d
the Matter, every Man’s Face can distinguish him in the Light, and his
Voice in the Dark; his Hand-writing can speak for him though absent,
and be his Witness, and secure his Contracts in future Generations. A
manifest, as well as admirable Indication of the divine Super-intendence
and Management[e].


FOOTNOTES:

[a] If the Reader hath a Mind to see Examples of Men’s Likeness, he may
consult _Valer. Maximus_, (L. 9. c. 14.) concerning the Likeness of
_Pompey_ the Great, and _Vibius_ and _Publicius Libertinus_; as also
of _Pompey_ the Father, who got the Name of _Coquus_, he being like
_Menogenes_ the Cook; with divers others.

[b] As the Difference of Tone makes a Difference between every Man’s
Voice, of the same Country, yea, Family; so a different Dialect and
Pronunciation, differs Persons of divers Countries; yea, Persons of one
and the same Country, speaking the same Language: Thus in _Greece_,
there were the _Ionick_, _Dorick_, _Attick_, and _Æolick_ Dialects.
So in _Great-Britain_, besides the grand Diversity of _English_, and
_Scotch_, the different Counties vary very much in their Pronunciation,
Accent and Tone, although all one and the same Language. And the Way
of the _Gileadites_ proving the _Ephraimites_, Judg. xii. 6. by the
Pronunciation of _Shibboleth_, with a _Schin_, or _Sibboleth_ with a
_Samech_, is well known. So _à Lapide_ saith, the _Flemings_ prove
whether a Man be a _Frenchman_ or not, by bidding him pronounce, _Act en
tachtentich_; which they pronounce, _Acht en tactentic_, by Reason they
can’t pronounce the Aspirate _h_.

neque violentiæ plebis judicantium religio cessit._ Val. Max. ib. c. 15.

[e] To the foregoing Instances of divine Management, with relation to
the political State of Man, I shall add another Thing, that I confess
hath always seem’d to me somewhat odd, but very providential; and that
is, the Value that Mankind, at least the civiliz’d Part of them, have
in all Ages put upon Gems, and the purer finer Metals, Gold and Silver;
so as to think them equivalent unto, and exchange them for Things of
the greatest Use for Food, Cloathing, and all other Necessaries and
Conveniences of Life. Whereas those Things themselves are of very little,
if any Use in Physick, Food, Building or Cloathing, otherwise than for
Ornament, or to minister to Luxury; as _Suetonius_ tells us of _Nero_,
who fish’d with a Net gilt with Gold, and shod his Mules with Silver;
but his Wife _Poppæa_, shod her Horses with Gold. _Vit. Ner._ c. 30.
Plin. N. H. L. 33. c. 11. So the same _Suetonius_ tells us, _Jul. Cæsar_
lay in a Bed of Gold, and rode in a silver Chariot. But _Heliogabalus_
rode in one of Gold, and had his Close-stool Pans of the same Metal. And
_Pliny_ saith, _Vasa Coquinaria ex argento Calvus Orator fieri queritur._
_Ibid._ Neither are those precious Things of greater Use to the making of
Vessels, and Utensils, (unless some little Niceties and Curiosities,) by
Means of their Beauty, Imperdibility, and Ductility. Of which last, the
great Mr. _Boyle_ hath among others, there two Instances, in his _Essay
about are Subtilty of Effluviums_. Chap. 2. _Silver, whose Ductility,
and Tractility, are very much inferior to those of Gold, was, by my
procuring, drawn out to so slender a Wire, that——a single Grain of it
amounted to twenty seven Feet._ As to Gold, he demonstrates it possible
to extend an Ounce thereof, to reach to 777600 Feet, or 155 Miles and an
half, yea, to an incredibly greater Length.

And as to Gems, the very Stories that are told of their prodigious
Virtues, are an Argument, that they have very little, or none more than
other hard Stones. That a _Diamond_ should discover whether a Woman be
true or false to her Husband’s Bed; cause Love between Man and Wife;
secure against Witchcraft, Plague and Poisons; that the _Ruby_ should
dispose to Cheerfulness, cause pleasant Dreams, change its Colour against
a Misfortune befalling, _&c._ that the _Sapphire_ should grow foul, and
lose its Beauty, when worn by one that is Leacherous; that the _Emerald_
should fly to pieces, if it touch the Skin of any unchaste Person in the
Act of Uncleanness: That the _Chrysolite_ should lose its Colour, if
Poyson be on the Table, and recover it again when the Poyson is off: And
to name no more, that the _Turcoise_, (and the same is said of a gold
Ring,) should strike the Hour when hung over a drinking Glass, and much
more the same Purpose: All these, and many other such fabulous Stories, I
say, of Gems, are no great Arguments, that their Virtue is equivalent to
their Value. Of these, and other Virtues, consult _Worm_ in his _Museum_,
L. 1. §. 2. c. 17, _&c._

But as to _Gems_ changing their Colour, there may be somewhat of Truth in
that, particularly in the _Turcoise_ last mention’d. Mr. _Boyle_ observ’d
the Spots in a _Turcoise_, to shift their Place from one Part to another,
by gentle Degrees. So did the Cloud in an _Agate_-handle of a Knife.
A _Diamond_ he wore on his Finger, he observ’d to be more illustrious
at some Times than others: Which a curious Lady told him she had also
observ’d in hers. So likewise a rich _Ruby_ did the same. _Boyle_ of

_The ~Conclusion~ of the ~Survey~ of MAN._


And now having taken a View of _Man_, and finding every Part of him,
every Thing relating to him contriv’d, and made in the very best Manner;
his Body fitted up with the utmost Foresight, Art and Care; and this
Body, (to the great Honour, Privilege, and Benefit of Man,) possess’d
by a divine Part, the _Soul_, a Substance made as ’twere on Purpose to
contemplate the Works of God, and glorify the great Creator; and since
this Soul can discern, think, reason, and speak; What can we conclude
upon the whole Matter, but that we lie under all the Obligations of Duty
and Gratitude, to be thankful and obedient to, and to set forth the
Glories of our great Creator, and noble Benefactor? And what ungrateful
Wretches are we, how much worse than the poor Irrationals, if we do not
employ the utmost Power of our Tongue, and all our Members, and all the
Faculties of our Souls in the Praises of God! But above all, should we,
who have the Benefit of those glorious Acts and Contrivances of the
Creator, be such wicked, such base, such worse than brutal Fools, to deny
the Creator[a], in some of his noblest Works? Should we so abuse our
Reason, yea, our very Senses; should we be so besotted by the Devil, and
blinded by our Lusts, as to attribute one of the best contriv’d Pieces of
Workmanship to blind Chance, or unguided Matter and Motion, or any other
such sottish, wretched, atheistical Stuff; which we never saw, nor ever
heard made any one Being[b] in any Age since the Creation? No, No! But
like wise and unprejudic’d Men, let us with _David_ say, _Psalm_ cxxxix.
14. (with which I conclude,) _I will praise thee, for I am fearfully
and wonderfully made; marvellous are thy Works, and that my Soul knoweth
right well._

Having thus made what (considering the Copiousness and Excellence of
the Subject,) may be called a very brief Survey of _Man_, and seen
such admirable Marks of the divine Design and Art; let us next take
a transient View of the other inferiour Creatures; and begin with
QUADRUPEDS.

CHAP. I.

_Of their Prone ~Posture~._


In taking a View of this Part of the Animal World, so far as the
Structure of their Bodies is conformable to that of Man, I shall pass
them by, and only take notice of some Peculiarities in them, which
are plain Indications of Design, and the Divine Super-intendence and
Management. And, 1. The most visible apparent Variation is the _Prone
Posture of their Body_: Concerning which, I shall take notice only of two
Things, the Parts ministring thereto, and the Use and Benefit thereof.

I. As for the Parts, ’tis observable, that in all these Creatures, the
_Legs_ are made exactly conformable to this Posture, as those in Man are
to his erect Posture: And what is farther observable also, is, that the
Legs and Feet are always admirably suited to the Motion and Exercises of
each Animal: In some they are made for Strength only, to support a vast,
unwieldy Body[a]; in others they are made for Agility and Swiftness[b],
in some they are made for only Walking and Running, in others for that,
and Swimming too[c]; in others for Walking and Digging[d]; and in others
for Walking and Flying[e]: In some they are made more lax and weak, for
the plainer Lands; in others rigid, stiff, and less flexible[f], for
traversing the Ice, and dangerous Precipices of the high Mountains[g];
in some they are shod with tough and hard Hoofs, some whole, some cleft;
in others with only a callous Skin. In which latter, ’tis observable that
the Feet are composed of Toes, some short for bare-going; some long to
supply the Place of a Hand[h]; some armed with long and strong Talons,
to catch, hold, and tear the Prey; some fenced only with short Nails, to
confirm the Steps in Running and Walking.

II. As the Posture of Man’s Body is the fittest for a rational Animal, so
is the Prone Posture of _Quadrupeds_ the most useful and beneficial to
themselves, as also most serviceable to Man. For they are hereby better
made for their gathering their Food, to pursue their Prey, to leap, to
climb, to swim, to guard themselves against their Enemies, and in a word,
to do whatever may be of principal Use to themselves; as also they are
hereby rendered more useful and serviceable to Man, for carrying his
Burdens, for tilling his Ground, yea, even for his Sports and Diversions.

And now I might here add a Survey of the excellent Contrivances of
the Parts ministring to this Posture of the four-footed Animals, the
admirable Structure of the Bones[i], the Joints and Muscles; their
various Sizes and Strength; their commodious Lodgment and Situation, the
nice Æquipoise of the Body, with a great deal more to the same purpose.
But I should be tedious to insist minutely upon such Particulars, and
besides, I have given a Touch upon these Kinds of Things, when I spake of
Man.

Passing by therefore many Things of this Kind, that might deserve Remark,
I shall only consider some of the Parts of _Quadrupeds_, differing from
what is found in Man[k], and which are manifest Works of Design.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] The Elephant being a Creature of prodigious Weight, the largest of
all Animals; _Pliny_ saith, hath its Legs accordingly made of an immense
Strength, like Pillars, rather than Legs.

[b] Deer, Hares, and other Creatures, remarkable for Swiftness, have
their Legs accordingly slender, but withal strong, and every way adapted
to their Swiftness.

[c] Thus the Feet of the _Otter_ are made, the Toes being all conjoined
with Membranes, as the Feet of Geese and Ducks are. And in Swimming, it
is observable, that when the Foot goes forward in the Water, the Toes are
close; but when backward, they are spread out, whereby they more forcibly
strike the Water, and drive themselves forward. The same may be observed
also in Ducks and Geese, _&c._

Of the _Castor_ or _Beaver_, the _French_ Academists say, _The Structure
of the Feet was very extraordinary, and sufficiently demonstrated, that
Nature hath designed this Animal to live in the Water, as well as upon
Land. For although it had four Feet, like Terrestrial Animals, yet the
hindmost seemed more proper to swim than walk with, the Five Toes of
which they were compos’d, being joined together like those of a Goose by
a Membrane, which serves this Animal to swim with. But the fore ones were
made otherwise; for there was no Membrane which held those Toes joined
together: And this was requisite for the Conveniency of this Animal,
which useth them as Hands like a Squirrel, when he eats._ Memoirs for a
Nat. Hist. of Animals, _pag. 84._

[d] The _Mole_’s Feet are a remarkable Instance.

[e] The Wings of the _Bat_ are a prodigious Deviation from Nature’s
ordinary Way. So ’tis in the _Virginian Squirrel_, whose Skin is extended
between the Fore-Legs and its Body.

[f] Of the Legs of the _Elk_, the _French_ Academists say, _Although
some Authors report, that there are ~Elks~ in ~Moscovia~, whose Legs are
jointless; there is great Probability, that this Opinion is founded on
what is reported of those ~Elks~ of ~Muscovia~, as well as of ~Cæsar~’s
~Alce~, and ~Pliny~’s ~Machlis~, that they have Legs so stiff and
inflexible, that they do run on Ice without slipping; which is a Way that
is reported that they have to save themselves from the Wolves, ~&c.~_
ibid. p. 108.

[g] The common tame _Goat_ (whose Habitation is generally on Mountains
and Rocks, and who delighteth to walk on the tops of Pales, Houses, _&c._
and to take great and seemingly dangerous Leaps) I have observ’d, hath
the Joints of the Legs very stiff and strong, the Hoof hollow underneath,
and its Edges sharp. The like, I doubt not, is to be found the _Wild
Goat_, considering what Dr. _Scheuchzer_ hath said of its climbing the
most dangerous Craggs of the _Alps_, and the Manner of their hunting it.
_Vid._ _Iter. Alpin._ 3. p. 9.

[h] Thus in _Apes_ and _Monkeys_, in the _Beaver_ before, and divers
others.

[i] It is a singular Provision Nature hath made for the Strength of the
_Lion_, if that be true, which _Galen_ saith is reported of its Bones
being not hollow (as in other Animals) but solid: Which Report he thus
far confirms, that most of the Bones are so; and that those in the Legs,
and some other Parts, have only a small and obscure Cavity in them.
_Vid._ _Galen. de Us. Part._ L. 11. c. 18.

[k] _These Sorts of Differences in the Mechanism of Animals, upon the
Score of the Position of their Bodies, occur so often, that it would be
no mean Service to Anatomy——if any one would give us a History of those
Variations of the Parts of Animals, which spring from the different
Postures of their Bodies._ Drake Anat. V. 1. B. 1. c. 17.




CHAP. II.

_Of the HEADS of QUADRUPEDS._


It is remarkable, that in Man, the Head is of one singular Form; in the
four-footed Race, as various as their Species. In some square and large,
suitable to their slow Motion, Food, and Abode; in others less, slender,
and sharp, agreeable to their swifter Motion, or to make their Way to
their Food[a], or Habitation under Ground[b]. But passing by a great many
Observations that might be made of this Kind, I shall stop a little at
the Brain, as the most considerable Part of this part of the Body, being
the great Instrument of Life and Motion in _Quadrupeds_, as ’tis in Man
of that, as also in all Probability the chief Seat of his immortal Soul.
And accordingly it is a remarkable Difference, that in Man the Brain is
large, affording Substance and Room for so noble a Guest; whereas in
_Quadrupeds_, it is but small. And another Thing no less remarkable,
is the Situation of the _Cerebrum_ and _Cerebellum_, or the greater or
lesser Brain, which I shall give in the Words of one of the most exact
Anatomists we have of that Part[c]: “Since, saith he, God hath given
to Man a lofty Countenance, to behold the Heavens, and hath also seated
an immortal Soul in the Brain, capable of the Contemplation of heavenly
Things; therefore, as his Face is erect, so the Brain is set in an higher
Place, namely, above the _Cerebellum_ and all the Sensories. But in
Brutes, whose Face is prone towards the Earth, and whose Brain is capable
of Speculation, the _Cerebellum_, (whose Business it is to minister
to the Actions and Functions of the _Præcordia_, the principal Office
in those Creatures) in them is situated in the higher Place, and the
_Cerebrum_ lower. Also some of the Organs of Sense, as the Ears and Eyes,
are placed, if not above the _Cerebrum_, yet at least equal thereto.”

Another Convenience in this Position of the _Cerebrum_ and _Cerebellum_,
the last ingenious Anatomist[d] tells us is this, “In the Head of Man,
saith he, the Base of the _Brain_ and _Cerebell_, yea, of the whole
Skull, is set parallel to the Horizon; by which Means there is the less
Danger of the two Brains joggling, or slipping out of their Place. But
in _Quadrupeds_, whose Head hangs down, the Base of the Skull makes a
right Angle with the Horizon, by which Means the Brain is undermost,
and the _Cerebell_ uppermost; so that one would be apt to imagine the
_Cerebell_ should not be steady, but joggle out of its Place. To remedy
which Inconvenience he tells us, And lest the frequent Concussions of the
_Cerebell_ should cause a Fainting, or disorderly Motion of the Spirits
about the _Præcordia_, therefore, by the Artifice of Nature, sufficient
Provision is made in all, by the _dura Meninx_ closely encompassing
the _Cerebellum_; besides which, it is (in some) guarded with a strong
bony Fence; and in others, as the Hare, the Coney, and such lesser
_Quadrupeds_, a part of the _Cerebell_ is on each Side fenced with the
_Os Petrosum_: So that by this double Stay, its whole Mass is firmly
contained within the Skull.”

Besides these Peculiarities, I might take notice of divers other Things
no less remarkable, as the _Nictitating Membrane_ of the Eye[e], the
different Passages of the _Carotid Arteries_[f] through the Skull, their
Branching into the _Rete Mirabile_[g], the different Magnitude of the
_Nates_, and some other Parts of the Brain in Beasts, quite different
from what it is in Man: But the Touches already given, may be Instances
sufficient to prevent my being tedious in inlarging upon these admirable
Works of God.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] Thus _Swine_, for Instance, who dig in the Earth for Roots and other
Food, have their Neck, and all Parts of their Head very well adapted to
that Service. Their Neck short, brawny, and strong; their Eyes set pretty
high out of the Way; their Snout long; their Nose callous and strong;
and their Sense of Smelling very accurate, to hunt out and distinguish
their Food in Mud, under Ground, and other the like Places where it lies
concealed.

[b] What hath been said of _Swine_ is no less, rather more remarkable in
the _Mole_, whose Neck, Nose, Eyes and Ears, are all fitted in the nicest
Manner to its subterraneous Way of Life.

[f] _Arteria Carotis Aliquanto posterius in homine quàm in alio quovis
animali, Calvariam ingreditur, scil. juxta illud foramen, per quod
sinus lateralis in Venam jugularem desiturus cranio elabitur; nam in
cæteris hæc arteria sub extremitate, seu processu acuto ossis petrosi,
inter cranium emergit: verùm in capite humano, eadem, ambage longiori
circumducta (ut sanguinis torrens, priusquam ad cerebri oram appellit,
fracto impetu, leniùs & placidiùs fluat) prope specum ab ingressu sinûs
lateralis factum, Calvariæ basin attingit;——& in majorem cautelam, tunicâ
insuper ascititiâ crassiore investitur._ And so he goes on to shew the
Conveniency of this Guard the Artery hath, and its Passage to the Brain,
and then saith, _Si hujusmodi conformationis ratio inquiritur, facilè
occurrit, in capite humano, ubi generosi affectus & magni animorum
impetus ac ardores excitantur, sanguinis in Cerebri oras appulsum debere
esse liberum & expeditum, ~&c.~ Atque hoc quidem respectu differt Homo à
plerisque Brutis, quibus, Arteria in mille surculos divisa, ne sanguinem
pleniore alveo, aut citatiore, quàm par est, cursu, ad cerebrum evehat,
Plexus Retiformes constituit, quibus nempe efficitur, ut sanguis tardo
admodum, lenique & æquabili fere stillicidio, in cerebrum illabatur._ And
then he goes on to give a farther Account of this _Artery_, and the _Rete
mirabile_ in divers Creatures. _Willis_, ibid. cap. 8.

[g] _Galen_ thinks the _Rete mirabile_ is for concocting and elaborating
the Animal Spirits, as the _Epididymides_, [the Convolutions κιρσοειδοῦς
ἕλικος] are for elaborating the Seed. _De Us. Part._ L. 9. c. 4. This
_Rete_ is much more conspicuous in Beasts than Man; and as Dr. _Willis_
well judges, serves, 1. To bridle the too rapid Incursion of the Blood
into the Brain of those Creatures, whose Heads hang down much. 2. To
separate some of the superfluous serous Parts of the Blood, and send
them to the Salival Glands, before the Blood enters the Brain of those
Animals, whose Blood is naturally of a watery Constitution. 3. To obviate
any Obstructions that may happen in the Arteries, by giving a free
Passage through other Vessels, when some are stopped.

In _Quadrupeds_, as the _Carotid Arteries_ are branched into the _Rete
Mirabile_, for the bridling the too rapid Current of Blood into the
Brain; so the _Vertebral Arteries_, are, near their Entrance into the
Skull, bent into an acuter Angle than in Man, which is a wise Provision
for the same Purpose.




CHAP. III.

_Of the Necks of QUADRUPEDS._


From the Head pass we to the Neck, no principal Part of the Body, but yet
a good Instance of the Creator’s Wisdom and Design, inasmuch as in Man it
is short, agreeable to the Erection of his Body; but in the Four-footed
Tribe it is long, answerable to the Length of the Legs[a], and in some
of these long, and less strong, serving to carry the Mouth to the Ground;
in others shorter, brawny and strong, serving to dig, and heave up great
Burdens[b].

But that which deserves especial Remark, is that peculiar Provision made
in the Necks of all, or most granivorous _Quadrupeds_, for the perpetual
holding down their Head in gathering their Food, by that strong,
tendinous and insensible _Aponeurosis_, or Ligament[c] braced from the
Head to the middle of the Back. By which means the Head, although heavy,
may be long held down without any Labour, Pain, or Uneasiness to the
Muscles of the Neck, that would otherwise be wearied by being so long
put upon the Stretch.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] It is very remarkable, that in all the Species of _Quadrupeds_, this
Equality holds, except only the _Elephant_; and that there should be a
sufficient special Provision made for that Creature, by its _Proboscis_
or _Trunk_. A Member so admirably contrived, so curiously wrought, and
with so great Agility and Readiness, applied by that unwieldy Creature to
all its several Occasions, that I take it to be a manifest Instance of
the Creator’s Workmanship. See its Anatomy to Dr. _A. Moulen_’s _Anat.
of the ~Elephant~_, p. 33. As also in Mr. _Blair_’s Account in _Phil.
Trans._ Nᵒ. 326.

CHAP. IV.

_Of the STOMACHS of QUADRUPEDS._


From the Neck, let us descend to the _Stomach_, a Part as of absolute
Necessity to the Being and Well-being of Animals, so is in the several
Species of _Quadrupeds_, sized, contrived, and made with the utmost
Variety and Art.[a] What Artist, what Being, but the infinite Conservator
of the World, could so well adapt every Food to all the several Kinds
of those grand Devourers of it! Who could so well sute their Stomachs
to the Reception and Digestion thereof; one kind of Stomach to the
Carnivorous, another to the Herbaceous Animals; one fitted to digest by
bare Mastication; and a whole set of Stomachs in others, to digest with
the Help of _Rumination_! Which last Act, together with the _Apparatus_
for that Service, is so peculiar, and withal so curious an Artifice of
Nature, that it might justly deserve a more particular Enquiry; but
having formerly mention’d it[b], and least I should be too tedious, I
shall pass it by.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] The peculiar Contrivance and Make of the _Dromedary_’s or _Camel_’s
Stomach, is very remarkable, which I will give from the _Parisian
Anatomists_: _At the top of the Second ~[of the 4 Ventricles]~ there
were several square Holes, which were the Orifices of about 30 Cavities,
made like Sacks placed between the two Membranes, which do compose
the Substance of this Ventricle. The View of these Sacks made us to
think that they might well be the Reservatories, where ~Pliny~ saith,
that Camels do a long Time keep the Water, which they drink in great
Abundance——to supply the Wants thereof in the dry Desarts, ~&c.~_ Vid.

CHAP. V.

_Of the HEART of QUADRUPEDS._


In this Part there is a notable Difference found between the Heart of Man
and that of Beasts, concerning the latter, of which I might take notice
of the remarkable Confirmation of the Hearts of Amphibious _Quadrupeds_,
and their Difference from those of Land-Animals, some having but one
Ventricle[a], some three[b], and some but two (like Land-Animals) but
then the _Foramen Ovale_ therewith[c]. All which may be justly esteemed
as wonderful, as they are excellent Provisions for the Manner of those
Animals living. But I shall content my self with bare Hints of these
Things, and speak only of two Peculiars more, and that but briefly.

One is the Situation of the Heart, which in Beasts is near the middle of
the whole Body; in Man, nearer the Head[d]. The Reasons of which I shall
give from one of the most curious Anatomists of that Part[e]. “Seeing,
saith he, the Trajection and Distribution of the Blood depends wholly on
the Systole of the Heart, and that its Liquor is not driven of its own
Nature so readily into the upper Parts as into Vessels even with it, or
downwards into those under it: If the Situation of the Heart had been
further from the Head, it must needs either have been made stronger to
cast out its Liquor with greater Force; or else the Head would want its
due Proportion of Blood. But in Animals that have a longer Neck, and
which is extended towards their Food as it were, the Heart is seated as
far from the other Parts; and they find no Inconvenience from it, because
they feed with their Head for the most part hanging down; and so the
Blood, as it hath farther to go to their Head than in others, so it goes
a plainer and often a steep Way[f].”

The other peculiar Matter is, the fastning (I formerly mentioned) which
the Cone of the _Pericardium_ hath in Man to the _Diaphragm_[g], whereas
in all _Quadrupeds_ it is loose. By which Means the Motion of the
_Midriff_, in that necessary Act of Respiration, is assisted both in the
upright Posture of Man, as also in the prone Posture of _Quadrupeds_[h];
which would be hindred, or rendred more difficult, if the Case was
otherwise: “Which must needs be the Effect of Wisdom and Design, and
that Man was intended by Nature to walk erect, and not upon all-four, as
_Quadrupeds_ do:” To express it in the Words of a great Judge in such
Matters [i].


FOOTNOTES:

[a] _Frogs_ are generally thought to have but one Ventricle in their
Hearts.

[b] The _Tortoise_ hath three Ventricles, as the _Parisian Academists_
in their _Memoirs_ affirm. _Besides these two Ventricles ~[before spoken
of]~ which were in the hinder Part of the Heart, which faceth the Spine;
there was_, say they, _a third in the Fore-part, inclining a little
towards the Right-side, ~&c.~_ Memoirs, _&c._ p. 259. But Mr. _Bussiere_
charges this as a Mistake in those ingenious Gentlemen, and asserts there
is but one Ventricle in the _Tortoise_’s Heart. See his Description of
the Heart of the _Land Tortoise_, in _Philos. Transact._ Nᵒ. 328.

[c] The _Sea-Calf_ is said by the _French Academists_, to have this
Provision, and their Account of it is this: _Its Heart was round
and flat. Its Ventricles appeared very large, and its Auricles
small.——Underneath the great Aperture, through which the Trunk of the
~Vena Cava~ conveyed the Blood into the right Ventricle of the Heart,
there was another, which penetrated into the ~Arteria Venosa~, and from
thence into the left Ventricle, and afterwards into the ~Aorta~. This
Hole called the ~Foramen Ovale~ in the ~Fœtus~, make the ~Anastomisis~,
by the Means of which, the Blood goes from the ~Cava~ into the ~Aorta~,
without passing through the Lungs._ French Anatomists, p. 124.

[h] _Finalem causam quod atrinet,——cùm erectus sit Hominis incessus atque
figura, eoque facilius abdominis viscera suo pondere descendant, minore
Diaphragmatis nixu atque Systole ad Inspirationem opus est; porro, cùm in

_Of the Difference between MAN and QUADRUPEDS in the ~Nervous~ Kind._


There is only one Difference more between _Man_ and _Quadrupeds_ that I
shall take notice of, and that is the Nervous Kind: And because it would
be tedious to insist upon many Particulars[a], I shall, for a Sample,
insist chiefly upon one, and that is, of Nature’s prodigious Care for a
due Communication and Correspondence between the Head and Heart of Man,
more than what is in the four-footed Tribe. For this Purpose, besides
the Correspondence, those Parts have by Means of the Nerves of the _Par
Vagum_ (common both to Man and Beast) there is a farther and more special
Communication and Correspondence occasioned by the Branches[b] of the
_intercostal Pair_ sent from the _Cervical Plexus_ to the Heart, and
_Præcordia_. By which Means the Heart and Brain of Man have a mutual
and very intimate Correspondence and Concern with each other, more than
is in other Creatures; or as one of the most curious Anatomists and
Observers of these Things saith[c], “Brutes are as ’twere Machines made
with a simpler, and less operose _Apparatus_, and endowed therefore
with only one and the same Kind of Motion, or determined to do the same
Thing: Whereas in Man, there is a great Variety of Motions and Actions.
For by the Commerce of the aforesaid _Cervical Plexus_[d] he saith, The
Conceptions of the Brain presently affect the Heart, and agitate its
Vessels and whole Appendage, together with the _Diaphragm_. From whence
the Alteration in the Motion of the Blood, the Pulse and Respiration. So
also on the contrary, when any Thing affects or alters the Heart, those
Impressions are not only retorted to the Brain by the same Duct of the
Nerves, but also the Blood it self (its Course being once changed) flies
to the Brain with a different and unusual Course, and there agitating
the animal Spirits with divers Impulses, produceth various Conceptions
and Thoughts in the Mind.” And he tells us, “That hence it was that the
ancient Divines and Philosophers too, made the Heart the Seat of Wisdom;
and certainly (saith he) the Works of Wisdom and Virtue do very much
depend upon this Commerce which is between the Heart and Brain:” And
so he goeth on with more to the same purpose. Upon the Account of this
_Intercostal Commerce_ with the Heart, being wanting in Brutes, there
is another singularly careful and wise Provision the infinite Creator
hath made in them, and that is, That by Reason both the _Par Vagum_ and
the _Intercostal_ too, do not send their Branches to the Heart, and
its Appendage in Brutes, therefore, lest their Heart should want a due
Proportion of Nervous Vessels, the _Par Vagum_ sends more Branches to
their Heart than to that of Man. This as it is a remarkable Difference
between Rational and Irrational Creatures; so it is as remarkable an
Argument of the Creator’s Art and Care; who altho’ he hath denied
Brute-Animals Reason, and the Nerves ministring thereto, yet hath another
Way supplied what is necessary to their Life and State. But let us hear
the same great Author’s Descant upon the Point[e]; “Inasmuch saith he,
as Beasts are void of Discretion, and but little subject to various and
different Passions, therefore there was no need that the Spirits that
were to be convey’d from the Brain to the _Præcordia_, should pass two
different Ways, namely, one for the Service of the vital Functions, and
another for the reciprocal Impressions of the Affections; but it was
sufficient that all their Spirits, whatever Use they were designed for,
should be conveyed one and the same Way.”

Here now in the _Nervous Kind_ we have manifest Acts of the Creator’s
Design and Wisdom, in this so manifest and distinct a Provision for
Rational and Irrational Creatures; and that _Man_ was evidently intended
to be the one, as the _Genus_ of _Quadrupeds_ was the other.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] Amongst these, I might name the Site of the Nerves proceeding from
the _Medulla Spinalis_, which Dr. _Lower_ takes notice of. In Beasts,
whose Spine is above the rest of the Body, the Nerves tend directly
downwards; but in Man, it being erect, the Nerves spring out of the
Spine, not at Right, but in Oblique Angles downwards, and pass also in
the Body the same Way. _Ibid._ p. 16.

_The CONCLUSION._


And now ’tis Time to pause a while, and reflect upon the whole. And as
from the Confederations in the preceding Book, we have especial Reason to
be thankful to our infinitely merciful Maker, for his no less kind than
wonderful Contrivances of our Body; so we have Reason from this brief
View I have taken of this last Tribe of the Creation, to acknowledge and
admire the same Creator’s Work and Contrivances in them. For we have
here a large Family of Animals, in every particular Respect, curiously
contrived and made, for that especial Posture, Place, Food, and Office
or Business which they obtain in the World. So that if we consider their
own particular Happiness and Good, or Man’s Use and Service; or if we
view them throughout, and consider the Parts wherein they agree with Man,
or those especially wherein they differ, we shall find all to be so far
from being Things fortuitous, undesigned, or any way accidental, that
every Thing is done for the best; all wisely contrived, and incomparably
fitted up, and every way worthy of the great Creator. And he that will
shut his Eyes, and not see God[a] in these his Works, even of the poor
Beasts of the Earth, that will not say (as _Elihu_ hath it, Job xxxv. 10,
11.) _Where is God my Maker, who teacheth us more than the Beasts of the
Earth, and maketh us wiser than the Fowls of the Heaven?_ Of such an one
we may use the Psalmist’s Expression, _Psal_. xlxix. 12. That _he is like
the Beasts[b] that perish_.

_A ~Survey~ of BIRDS._


Having briefly, as well as I could, dispatch’d the Tribe of _Quadrupeds_,
I shall next take as brief and transient a View of the _feather’d Tribe_.

And here we have another large Province to expatiate in, if we should
descend to every Thing wherein the Workmanship of the Almighty appears.
But I must contract my Survey as much as may be; and shall therefore give
only such Hints and Touches upon this curious Family of Animals, as may
serve for Samples of the rest of what might be observ’d.

CHAP. I.

_Of the MOTION of Birds, and the PARTS ministring thereto._


As this Tribe hath a different Motion from that of other Animals, and
an amphibious Way of Life; partly in the Air, and partly on the Land
and Waters; so is their Body accordingly shap’d, and all their Parts
incomparably fitted for that Way of Life and Motion; as will be found by
a cursory View of some of the Particulars. And the

I. And most visible Thing, is the Shape and Make of their Body, not thick
and clumsy, but incomparably adapted to their Flight: Sharp before, to
pierce and make Way through the Air, and then by gentle Degrees rising to
its full Bulk. To which we may add,

II. The neat Position of the _Feathers_ throughout the Body; not ruffled,
or discompos’d, or plac’d some this, some a contrary Way, according to
the Method of Chance; but all artificially plac’d[a], for facilitating
the Motion of the Body, and its Security at the same Time, by way of
Cloathing: And for that End, most of the Feathers tend backward, and
are laid over one another in exact and regular Method, armed with warm
and soft Down next the Body, and more strongly made, and curiously
clos’d next the Air and Weather, to fence off the Injuries thereof. To
which Purpose, as also for the more easy and nimble gliding of the Body
through the Air, the Provision Nature hath made, and the Instinct of
these Animals to _preen_ and _dress_ their Feathers, is admirable; both
in respect of their Art and Curiosity in doing it, and the _Oyl-bag_[b],
Glands, and whole Apparatus for that Service.

III. And now having said thus much relating to the Body’s Motion, let
us survey the grand Instrument thereof, the _Wings_. Which as they are
principal Parts, so are made with great Skill, and plac’d in the most
commodious Point of the Body[c], to give it an exact Equipoise in that
subtile Medium, the Air.

And here it is observable, with what incomparable Curiosity every Feather
is made; the _Shaft_ exceeding strong, but hollow below, for Strength
and Lightness sake; and above, not much less strong, and fill’d with a
_Parenchyma_ or _Pith_, both strong and light too. The _Vanes_ as nicely
gaug’d on each Side as made; broad on one Side, and narrower on the
other; both which incomparably minister to the progressive Motion of the
Bird, as also to the Union and Closeness of the Wing[d].

And no less exquisite is the textrine Art of the _Plumage_[e] also; which
is so curiously wrought, and so artificially interwoven, that it cannot
be viewed without Admiration, especially when the Eye is assisted with
Glasses.

And as curiously made, so no less curiously are the Feathers placed in
the Wing, exactly according to their several Lengths and Strength: The
_Principals_ set for Stay and Strength, and these again well lined,
faced, and guarded with the _Covert_ and _Secondary Feathers_, to keep
the Air from passing through, whereby the stronger Impulses are made
thereupon.

And lastly, To say no more of this Part, that deserves more to be said
of it, what an admirable _Apparatus_ is there of _Bones_, very strong,
but withal light and incomparably wrought? of _Joynts_, which open, shut,
and every way move, according to the Occasions either of extending it
in Flight, or withdrawing the Wing again to the Body? And of various
_Muscles_; among which the peculiar Strength of the _Pectoral Muscles_
deserves especial Remark, by Reason they are much stronger[f] in Birds
than in Man, or any other Animal, not made for Flying.

IV. Next the Wings, the Tail is in Flight considerable; greatly assisting
in all Ascents and Descents in the Air, as also serving to steady[g]
Flight, by keeping the Body upright in that subtile and yielding
_Medium_, by its readily turning and answering every Vacillation of the
Body.

And now to the Parts serving to Flight, let us add the nice and compleat
Manner of its Performance; all done according to the strictest Rules of
Mechanism[h]. What Rower on the Waters, what Artist on the Land, what
acutest Mathematician could give a more agreeable and exact Motion to the
Wings, than these untaught flying Artists do theirs! Serving not only to
bear their Bodies up in the Air, but also to waft them along therein,
with a speedy progressive Motion, as also to steer and turn them this Way
and that Way, up and down, faster or slower, as their Occasions require,
or their Pleasure leads them.

V. Next to the Parts for Flight, let us view the _Feet_ and _Legs_
ministering to their other Motion: Both made light, for easier
Transportation through the Air; and the former spread, some with
Membranes for Swimming[i], some without, for steady Going, for Perching,
for Catching and Holding of Prey[k], or for Hanging by the Heels to
gather their Food[l], or to fix themselves in their Places of Retreat
and Safety. And the latter, namely the _Legs_, all curved for their easy
Perching, Roosting, and Rest, as also to help them upon their Wings in
taking their Flight, and to be therein commodiously tucked up to the
Body, so as not to obstruct their Flight. In some long, for Wading and
Searching the Waters; in some of a moderate Length, answerable to their
vulgar Occasions; and in others as remarkably short, to answer their
especial Occasions and Manner of Life[m]. To all which let us add the
placing these last mentioned Parts in the Body. In all somewhat out of
the Center of the Body’s Gravity[n], but in such as swim, more than in
others, for the better rowing their Bodies through the Waters, or to help
them in that Diving[o] too.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] See before _Book IV. Chap. 12. Note (l)._

[b] Mr. _Willughby_ saith, there are two Glands for the Secretion of the
unctuous Matter in the _Oyl-bag_. And so they appear to be in Geese. But
upon Examination, I find, that in most other Birds, (such at least as I
have enquir’d into,) there is only one Gland: In which are divers little
Cells, ending in two or three larger Cells, lying under the Nipple of the
_Oyl-bag_. This _Nipple_ is perforated, and being pressed, or drawn by
the Bird’s Bill, or Head, emits the liquid Oyl, as it is in some Birds,
or thicker unctuous Grease, as it is in others. The whole _Oyl-bag_ is
in its structure somewhat conformable to the Breasts of such Animals as
afford Milk.

[c] In all Birds that fly much, or that have the most occasion for their
Wings, it is manifest that their Wings are plac’d in the very best Part,
to balance their Body in the Air, and to give as swift a Progression, as
their Wings and Body are capable of: For otherwise we should perceive
them to reel, and fly unsteadily; as we see them to do, if we alter their
Æquipoise, by cutting the End of one of the Wings, or hanging a Weight at
any of the extreme Parts of the Body. But as for such Birds as have as
much occasion for Swimming as Flying, and whole Wings are therefore set
a little out of the Center of the Bodies Gravity. See _Book IV. Chap. 8.
Note (q)._ And for such as have more occasion for Diving than Flying, and
whose Legs are for that Reason set more backward, and their Wings more
forward. _Chap. 4. Note (k)_ of this _Book_.

[d] The wise Author of Nature hath afforded an Example of the great
Nicety in the Formation of Birds, by the Nicely observ’d in a Part no
more considerable than the Vanes of the Flag-feathers of the Wing. Among
others, these two Things are observable: 1. The Edges of the exterior or
narrow Vanes bend downwards, but of the interior or wider Vanes upwards;
by which Means they catch, hold, and lie close to one another, when the
Wing is spread; so that not one Feather may miss its full Force and
Impulse upon the Air. 2. A yet lesser Nicety is observ’d, and that is, in
the very sloping the Tips of the Flag-feathers: The interiour Vanes being
neatly slop’d away to a Point, towards the outward Part of the Wing; and
the exteriour Vanes slop’d towards the Body, at least in many Birds; and
in the Middle of the Wing, the Vanes being equal, are but little slop’d.
So that the Wing, whether extended or shut, is as neatly slop’d and
form’d, as if constantly trimm’d with a Pair of Scissors.

[e] Since no exact Account that I know of, hath been given of the
Mechanism of the _Vanes_, or _Webs_ of the Feathers, my Observations may
not be unacceptable. The _Vane_ consists not of one continu’d Membrane;
because if one broken, it would hardly be reparable: But of many
_Laminæ_, which are thin, stiff, and somewhat of the Nature of a thin
Quill. Towards the Shaft of the Feather, (especially in the Flag-feathers
of the Wing,) those _Laminæ_ are broad, _&c._ of a semicircular Form;
which serve for Strength, and for the closer shutting of the _Laminæ_
to one another, when Impulses are made upon the Air. Towards the outer
Part of the Vane, those _Laminæ_ grow slender and taper: On their under
Side they are thin and smooth, but their upper outer Edge is parted into
two hairy Edges, each Side having a different Sort of Hairs, laminated
or broad at Bottom, and slender and bearded above the other half. I
have, as well as I could, represented the uppermost Edge of one of these
_Laminæ_ in Fig. 18. with some of the Hairs on each Side, magnify’d with
a Microscope. These bearded Bristles, or Hairs, on one Side the _Laminæ_,
have strait Beards, as in Fig. 19. those on the other Side, have hook’d
Beards on one Side the slender Part of the Bristle, and strait ones on
the other, as in Fig. 20. Both these Sorts of Bristles magnify’d, (only
scattering, and not close,) are represented as they grow upon the upper
Edge of the _Lamina s. t._ in Fig. 18. And in the Vane, the hook’d Beards
of one _Lamina_, always lie next the strait Beards of the next _Lamina_;
and by that Means lock and hold each other; and by a pretty Mechanism,
brace the _Laminæ_ close to one another. And if at any Time the Vane
happens to be ruffled and discompos’d, it can by this pretty easy
Mechanism, be reduc’d and repair’d. Vid. _Book IV. Chap. 12. Note (m)._

sunt; non æquant 50am aut 70am partem omnium Musculorum Hominis. E contra

& magìs pendent, quàm reliqui omnes Musculi ejusdem Avis simul sumpti._
Borell. de Mot. Animal. Vol. I. Prop. 184.

Mr. _Willughby_ having made the like Observation, hath this Reflection on
it, _whence, if it be possible for Man to fly, it is thought by them who
have curiously weighed and considered the matter, that he would attempt
such a Thing with Hopes of Success, must so contrive and adapt his Wings,
that he may make use of his Legs, and not his Arms in managing them_:
(because the Muscles of the Legs are stronger, as he observes.) Willugh.
Ornith. L. 1. c. 1. §. 19.

[g] Mr. _Willughby_, _Ray_, and many others, imagine the principal use
of the Tail to be to steer, and turn the Body in the Air, as a Rudder.
But _Borelli_ hath put it beyond all doubt, that this is the least use of
it, and that it is chiefly to assist the Bird in its Ascents and Descents
in the Air, and to obviate the Vacillations of the Body and Wings. For
as for turning to this or that Side, it is performed by the Wings and
Inclination of the Body, and but very little by the help of the Tail.

[h] See _Borelli ubi supr._ Prop. 182, _&c._

[i] It is considerable in all Water-Fowl, how exactly their Legs and
Feet correspond to that way of Life. For either their Legs are long, to
enable them to wade in the Waters: In which case, their Legs are bare
of Feathers a good way above the Knees, the more conveniently for this
Purpose. Their Toes also are all abroad; and in such as bear the Name
of _Mudsuckers_, two of the Toes are somewhat joined, that they may
not easily sink in walking upon boggy Places. And as for such as are
whole-footed, or whose Toes are webbed together (excepting some few)
their Legs are generally short, which is the most convenient Size for
Swimming. And ’tis pretty enough to see how artificially they gather up
their Toes and Feet when they withdraw their Legs, or go to take their
Stroke; and as artificially again extend or open their whole Foot, when
they press upon, or drive themselves forward in the Waters.

[k] Some of the Characteristicks of Rapacious Birds, are, _to have
hooked, strong, and sharp-pointed Beaks and Talons, fitted for Rapine,
and tearing of Flesh; and strong and brawny Thighs, for striking down
their Prey._ Willughby Ornith. L. 2. c. 1. Raii Synops. Av. Method. p. 1.

[l] Such Birds as climb, particularly those of the _Wood-pecker_ Kind,
have for this Purpose (as Mr. _Willughby_ observes, L. 2. c. 4.) 1.
Strong and musculous Thighs. 2. Short Legs and very strong. 3. Toes
standing two forwards and two backwards. Their Toes also are close joined
together, that they may more strongly and firmly lay hold on the Tree
they climb upon. 4. All of them——have a hard stiff Tail bending also
downwards, on which they lean, and so bear up themselves in climbing.

[m] _Swifts_ and _Swallows_ have remarkably short Legs, especially the
former, and their Toes grasp any Thing very strongly. All which is useful
to them in building their Nests, and other such Occasions as necessitate
them to hang frequently by their Heels. But there is far greater use of
this Structure of their Legs and Feet, if the Reports be true of their
hanging by the Heels in great Clusters (after the manner of Bees) in
Mines and Grotto’s, and on the Rocks by the Sea, all the Winter. Of
which latter, I remember the late learned Dr. _Fry_ told this Story at
the University, and confirmed it to me since, _viz._ That an ancient
Fisherman, accounted an honest Man, being near some Rocks on the Coast of
_Cornwal_, saw at a very low Ebb, a black List of something adhering to
the Rock, which when he came to examine, he found it was a great Number
of _Swallows_, and, if I misremember not, of _Swifts_ also, hanging by
the Feet to one Another, as Bees do; which were covered commonly by the
Sea-Waters, but revived in his warm Hand, and by the Fire. All this the
Fisherman himself assured the Doctor of. Of this, see more, _Chap. 3.
Note (d)_ of this Book.

[n] In Birds that frequent not the Waters, the Wings are in the Center
of Gravity, when the Bird lies along, as in Flying; but when it stands
or walks, the Erection of the Body throws the Center of Gravity upon the
Thighs and Feet.

[o] See _Chap. 4. Note (k)._




CHAP. II.

_Of the HEAD, STOMACH, and other Parts of Birds._


Thus having dispatched the Parts principally concerned in the Motion
of the _Feather’d Tribe_, let us proceed to some other Parts not yet
animadverted upon. And we will begin with the _Head_, concerning which
I have already taken notice of its Shape for making way through the
Air; of the make of the _Bill_, for gathering Food, and other Uses; the
commodious Situation of the _Eye_; and I might add that of the _Ear_
too, which would be in the way, and obstruct Flight, if ’twas like that
of most other Animals: Also I might say a great deal of the Conformation
of the _Brain_, and of the Parts therein wanting, and of others added,
like to what is observable in Fishes; whose Posture in the Waters
resembles that of Birds in the Air[a], and both very different from Man
and Beasts; and lastly, to hint at no more, I might survey the peculiar
Structure of the _Larynx_[b], the _Tongue_[c], the inner _Ear_[d], and
many Matters besides; but for a Sample, I shall only insist upon the
wonderful Provision in the Bill for the judging of the Food, and that
is by peculiar Nerves lodged therein for that Purpose; small and less
numerous in such as have the Assistance of another Sense, the Eye; but
large, more numerous, and thickly branched about, to the very End of the
Beak, in such as hunt for their Food out of Sight in the Waters, in Mud,
or under Ground[e].

And now from the Head and Mouth, pass we to its near Ally, the Stomach,
another no less notable than useful Part; whether we consider the
Elegancy of its Fibres and Muscles, or its Multiplicity; one to soften
and macerate, another to digest; or its Variety, suited to various Foods,
some membraneous, agreeable to the frugivorous, or carnivorous Kind; same
musculous and strong[f], suited to the Comminution, and grinding of Corn
and Grain, and so to supply the Defect of Teeth.

And now to this Specimen of the Parts, I might add many other Things,
no less curiously contriv’d, made and suited to the Occasions of these
Volatiles; as particularly the Stratum and Lodgment of the _Lungs_[g];
the Configuration of the _Breast_, and its Bone, made like a Keel, for
commodious Passage through the Air, to bear the large and strong Muscles,
which move the Wings, and to counterpoise the Body, and support and rest
it upon at roost. The _Neck_ also might deserve our Notice, always either
exactly proportion’d to the Length of the Legs, or else longer, to hunt
out Food, to search in the Waters[h]; as also to counterpoise the Body
in Flight[i]. And lastly, I might here take Notice of the Defect of the
Diaphragm, so necessary in other Animals to Respiration; and also of
divers other Parts redundant, defective, or varying from other Animals.
But it would be tedious to insist upon all; and therefore to the Examples
already given, I would rather recommend a nice Inspection[k], of those
curious Works of God, which would be manifest Demonstrations of the
admirable Contrivance and Oeconomy of the Bodies of those Creatures.

From the Fabrick therefore of their Bodies, I shall pass to a Glance of
one or two Things, relating to their _State_; and so conclude this Genus
of the animal World.

[c] The Structure of the _Tongue_ of the _Wood-Pecker_ is very singular
and remarkable, whether we look at its great Length, its Bones and
Muscles, its encompassing part of the Neck and Head, the better to exert
it self in Length; and again, to retract it into its Cell; and lastly,
whether we look at its sharp, horny, bearded Point, and the glewy Matter
at the end of it, the better to stab, to stick unto, and draw out little
Maggots out of Wood. _Utilis enim Picis_ (saith _Coiter_) _ad Vermiculos,

[d] I have before, in _Book IV. Chap. 3. Note (u)_, taken notice of what
others have observed concerning the _inner Ear_ of _Birds_, reserving my
own Observations for this Place: Which I hope may be acceptable, not only
for being some of them new, but also shewing the Mechanism of Hearing in
general.

In this Organ of Birds, I shall take notice only of three Parts, the
_Membranes_ and _Cartilages_; the _Columella_; and the _Conclave_: The
_Drum_, as some call it, or _Membrana Tympani_, as others, consists of
two Membranes, the Outer, which covers the whole _Meatus_, Bason or
_Drum_, (as some call it) and the inner Membrane. To support, distend
and relax the outermost, there is one single Cartilage, reaching from
the Side of the _Meatus_, to near the middle of the Membrane. On the top
of the _Columella_ is another Cartilage, consisting of three Branches,
_a.b.c._ in Fig. 23. The longest middle Branch _a_. is joined to the
top of the single upper Cartilage before spoken of, and assists it to
bear up the upper outer Membrane: The two Branches, _b.c._ are joined to
the _Os Petrosum_, at some distance from the outer Membrane: Upon this
inner Cartilage, is the inner Membrane fixed, the two outer Sides of
which, _a.b._ and _a.c._ are joined to the outer Membrane, and make a
kind of three-square Bag. The Design of the two Branches or Legs of the
Cartilage, _b.c._ are I conceive to keep the _Cartilage_ and _Columella_
from wavering side-ways, and to hinder them from flying too much back:
There is a very fine slender Ligament extended from the opposite side,
quite cross the _Meatus_ or Bason, to the Bottom of the _Cartilage_, near
its joining to the _Columella_. Thus much for the _Membranæ Tympani_, and
their _Cartilages_.

The next Part is the _Columella_ (as _Schelhammer_ calls it.) This is a
very fine, thin, light, bony Tube; the Bottom of which spreads about,
and gives it the Resemblance of a wooden Pot-lid, such as I have seen
in Country-Houses. It exactly shuts into, and covers a _Foramen_ of
the _Conclave_, to which it is braced all round, with a fine subtile
Membrane, composed of the tender Auditory Nerve. This Bottom or Base of
the _Columella_, I call the _Operculum_.

The last Part, which some call the _Labyrinth_ and _Cochlea_, consisting
of Branches more like the _Canalos Semicirculares_ in Man, than the
_Cochlea_, I call the _Conclave Auditûs_. It is (at in most other
Animals) made of hard context Bone. In most of the Birds I have opened,
there are _circular Canals_, some larger, some lesser, crossing one
another at right Angles, which open into the _Conclave_. But in the
_Goose_ it is otherwise, there being cochleous Canals, but not like
those of other Birds. In the _Conclave_, at the Side opposite to the
_Operculum_, the tender Part of the _Auditory Nerve_ enters, and lineth
all those inner retired Parts, _viz._ the _Conclave_ and _Canals_.

As to the _Passages_, _Columnæ_, and other Parts observable in the Ear
of Birds, I shall pass them by, it being sufficient to my Purpose, to
have described the Parts principally concerned in the Act of Hearing.
And as the Ear is in Birds the most simple and incomplex of any Animals
Ear; so we may from it make an easy and rational Judgment, how _Hearing_
is performed, _viz._ _Sound_ being a _Tremor_, or _Undulation_ in the
Air, caused by the Collision of Bodies, doth as it moves along, strike
upon the _Drum_, or _Membrana Tympani_ of the Ear: Which Motion, whether
strong or languid, shrill or soft, tuneful or not, is at the same Instant
impressed upon the _Cartilages_, _Columella_, and _Operculum_, and so
communicated to the _Auditory Nerve_ in the _Conclave_.

And now if we compare the Organ and Act of Hearing, with those of Sight,
we shall find, that the _Conclave_ is to Hearing, as the _Retina_ is
to Sight; that sonorous Bodies make their Impressions thereby on the
Brain, as visible Objects do by the _Retina_. Also, that as there is an
_Apparatus_ in the Eye, by the opening and shutting of the Pupil, to make
it correspond to all the Degrees of Light, so there is in the Ear to
make it conformable to all the Degrees of Sound, a noble Train of little
Bones and Muscles in Man, _&c._ to strain and relax the Membrane, and
at the same Time to open and shut the _Basis_ of the _Stapes_ (the same
as what I call the _Operculum_ in Birds:) But in Birds, there is a more
simple, but sufficient _Apparatus_ for this Purpose, tender Cartilages,
instead of Bones and Joints, to correspond to the various Impressions of
Sounds, and to open and shut the _Operculum_. Besides which, I suspect
the Ligament I mentioned, is only the Tendon of a Muscle, reaching to the
inner _Membrana Tympani_, and joined thereto (as I find by a stricter
Scrutiny) and not to the Cartilage, as I imagined. By this Muscle, the
inner Membrane, and by Means of that the Outer also can be distended or
relaxed, as it is in Man, by the _Malleus_ and its Muscle, _&c._

[e] _Flat-billed Birds, that grope for their Meat, have three Pair of
Nerves, that come into their Bills, whereby they have that Accuracy to
distinguish what is proper for Food, and what to be rejected by their
Taste, when they do not see it. This was most evident in a Duck’s Bill
and Head; a Duck having larger Nerves that come into their Bills than
Geese, or any other Bird that I have seen; and therefore quaffer and
grope out their Meat the most. But then I discovered none of these Nerves
in round-bill’d Birds. But since, in my Anatomies in the Country, in a
Rook, I first observed two Nerves that came down betwixt the Eyes into
the upper Bill, but considerably smaller than any of the three Pair of
Nerves, in the Bills of Ducks, but larger than the Nerves in any other
round-bill’d Birds. And ’tis remarkable that these Birds, more than any
other round-bill’d Birds, seem to grope for their Meat in Cow-dung,
~&c.~_ _Mr._ J. Clayton, _in_ Philos. Transact. Nᵒ. 206.

_I observ’d three Pair of Nerves in all the broad-bill’d Birds that I
could meet with, and in all such at feel for their Food out of Sight,
as Snipes, Woodcocks, Curlews, Geese, Ducks, Teals, Widgeons, ~&c.~
These Nerves are very large, equalling almost the Optic Nerve in
Thickness.——Two are distributed nigh the End of the upper Bill, and are
there very much expanded, passing through the Bone into the Membrane,
lining the Roof of the Mouth._ Dr. _A. Moulen_. Ibid. Nᵒ. 199. Or both in
Mr. _Lowthorp_’s Abridg. V. 2. p. 861, 862.

[f] The _Gizzard_ is not only made very strong, especially in the
Granivorous; but hath also a Faculty of Grinding what is therein. For
which Purpose, the Bird swalloweth rough Stones down, which, when grown
smooth, are rejected and cast out of the Stomach, as useless. This
Grinding may be heard in Falcons, Eagles, _&c._ by laying the Ear close
to them, when their Stomachs are empty, as the famous Dr. _Harvey_ saith.
_De Generat. Exer._ 7.

As to the Strength of the _Gizzard_, and the Use of Stones to the
Digestion of Fowls, divers curious Experiments may be met with, try’d by
_Seigneur Redi_, with glass Bubbles, solid Glass, Diamonds, and other
hard Bodies. See his _Exp. Nat._

[g] It is no less remarkable in Birds, that their _Lungs_ adhere to the
_Thorax_, and have but little play, than that to other Animals they
are loose, and play much, which is a good Provision for their steady
Flight. Also they want the _Diaphragm_, and instead thereof, have divers
large Bladders made of thin transparent Membranes, with pretty large
Holes out of one into the other. These Membranes seem to me to serve
for _Ligaments_, or _Braces_ to the _Viscera_, as well as to contain
Air. Towards the upper Part, each Lobe of the Lungs is perforated in two
Places, with large Perforations; whereof one is towards the outer, the
other towards the inner Part of the Lobe. Through these Perforations, the
Air hath a Passage into the Belly, (as in _Book I. Chap. 1. Note (b)_;)
that is, into the foremention’d Bladders; so that by blowing into the
_aspera Arteria_, the Lungs will be a little rais’d, and the whole Belly
blown up, so as to be very turgid. Which doubtless is a Means to make
their Bodies more or less buoyant, according as they take in more or less
Air, to facilitate thereby, their Ascents, and Descents: Like as it is in
the _Air-bladders_ of Fishes, in the last cited Place. _Note (i)._

[h] _Such Birds as have long Legs, have also a long Neck; for that
otherwise they could not commodiously gather up their Food, either on
Land, or in the Water. But on the other Side, those which have long
Necks, have not always long Legs, as in Swans——whose Necks serve them to
reach to the Bottom of Rivers, ~&c.~_ Willughby’s Ornithol. L. 1. c. 1.
§. 7.

[i] We have sufficient Instances of this in _Geese_, _Ducks_, &c. whose
Wings, (their Bodies being made for the Convenience of Swimming,) are
plac’d out of the Center of Gravity, nearer the Head. But the extending
the Neck and Heads in Flight, causeth a due Æquipoise and Libration of
the Body upon the Wing. Which is another excellent Use of the long Necks
of these Birds, besides that of reaching and searching in the Waters for
their Food.

But in the _Heron_, whose Head and long Neck, (although tuck’d up in
Flight,) over-balance the hinder Part of the Body; the long Legs are
extended in Flight, to counterpoise the Body, as well as to supply what
is wanting in the Tail, from the Shortness of it.

[k] _Steno_ thus Concludes his Myology of the Eagle, _Imperfecta
hæc Musculorum descriptio, non minùs arida est Legentibus, quàm
Inspectantibus fuerit jucunda eorundem præparatio. Elegantissima enim
Mechanices artificia, creberrimè in illis obvia, verbis non nisi
obscure exprimuntur, carnium autem ductu, tendinum colore, insertionum
proportione, & trochlearam distributione oculis exposita omnem superant
admirationem._ Steno in Blas. Anat. Animal. P. 2. c. 4.




CHAP. III.

_Of the MIGRATION of Birds._


Concerning the _State_ of this Tribe of _Animals_, the first Thing I
shall speak of, (by Reason God himself instanceth in it,) shall be their
Migration, mention’d, _Jer._ viii. 7. _Yea, the Stork in the Heaven
knoweth her appointed Times, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the
Swallow observe the Time of their Coming; but my People, ~&c.~_

In which Act of Migration, there are two Things to me, exceedingly
notable. One is what the Text speaks of, their knowing their proper Times
for their _Passage_, when to come[a], when to go; as also that some
should come when others go; and some others go when these come. There is
no doubt but the Temperature of the Air, as to Heat and Cold, and their
natural Propensity to breed their Young; may be great Incentives to those
Creatures to change their Habitation: But yet it is a very odd Instinct,
that they should at all shift their Habitation: That some certain
Place is not to be found in all the terraqueous Globe, affording them
convenient Food and Habitation all the Year, either in the colder Climes,
for such as Delight in the colder Regions, or the hotter, for such _Birds
of Passage_ as fly to us in Summer.

Also it is somewhat strange, that those untaught, unthinking Creatures,
should so exactly know the best and only proper Seasons to go and
come. This gives us good Reason to interpret the ‎‏מועדיה‏‎ _appointed
times_[b], in the Text, to be such Times as the Creator hath appointed
those Animals, and hath accordingly, for this End, imprinted upon their
Natures such an Instinct, as exciteth and moveth them thus, at proper
Times, to fly from a Place that would obstruct their Generation, or not
afford convenient Food for them, and their Young, and betake themselves
to another Place, affording all that is wanting for Food or Incubation.

And this leads me to another Thing remarkable in this Act of Migration;
and that is, That those unthinking Creatures should know what Way to
steer their Course[c] and whither to go. What but the great Creator’s
Instinct should ever move a poor foolish Bird, to venture over vast
Tracts of Land, but especially over large Seas? If it should be said,
That by their high Ascents up into the Air, they can see cross the Seas;
yet what should teach or persuade them, that that Land is more proper for
their Purpose, than this? That _Britain_, (for Instance,) should afford
them better Accommodations than _Ægypt_[d], than the _Canaries_, than
_Spain_, or any of those many intermediate Places over which some of
them probably fly.

And lastly, to all this, let us briefly add the Accommodations these
_Birds of Passage have_, to enable them to take such long Flights, _viz._
the Length of their Wings, or their more than ordinary Strength[e] for
Flight.

[d] I instance particularly in _Ægypt_, because Mr. _Willughby_ thinks
_Swallows_ fly thither, and into _Æthiopia_, &c. and that they do

_Ornith._ L. 2. c. 3. But _Etmuller_ puts the Matter out of doubt; who
saith, _Memini me plures, quàm quas Medimnus caperit, Hirundines arcte

Ol. Mag. Hist. L. 19. c. 20.

Since my penning this Note, we had, at a Meeting of the Royal-Society,
_Feb. 12. 1712-13._ a farther Confirmation of _Swallows_ retiring under
Water in Winter, from Dr. _Golas_, a Person very curious in these
Matters; who speaking of their Way of Fishing in the northern Parts, by
breaking Holes, and drawing their Nets under the Ice, saith, that he saw
sixteen Swallows so drawn out of the _Lake of Samrodt_, and about Thirty
out of the King’s great Pond in _Rosineilen_; and that at _Schlebitten_,
near an House of the Earl of _Dohna_, he saw two Swallows just come out
of the Waters, that could scarce stand, being very wet and weak, with
their Wings hanging on the Ground: And that he hath observ’d the Swallows
to be often weak for some Days after their Appearance.

[e] As _Swallows_ are well accommodated for long Flights, by their long
Wings, so are _Quails_ by the Strength of their _pectoral Muscles_, by
the Breadth of their Wings, _&c._ For Quails have but short Wings for the
Weight of their Body; and yet they fly from us into warmer Parts, against
Winter, and to us in Spring, crossing our Seas. So divers Travellers tell
us they cross the _Mediterranean_ twice a Year, flying from _Europe_ to
_Africa_, and back again: Thus _Bellonius_ in Mr. _Willughby_, saith,
When we sail’d from _Rhodes_ to _Alexandria_ of _Ægypt_, many Quails
flying from the North towards the South, were taken in our Ship; _whence
I am verily persuaded, that they shift Places: For formerly also, when
I sail’d out of the Isle of ~Zant~ to ~Morea~, or ~Negropont~, in the
Spring Time, I had observ’d ~Quails~ flying the contrary Way, from
~South~ to ~North~, that they might abide there all Summer. At which Time
also, there were a great many taken in our Ship._ Ornith. p. 170.




CHAP. IV.

_Of the INCUBATION of Birds._


Another Thing relating to the State of this Tribe of Animals, is their
_Incubation_.

And first, the _Egg_ it self deserves our Notice. Its Parts within, and
its crusty Coat without, are admirably well fitted for the Business of
Incubation. That there should be one Part provided for the Formation
of the Body[a], before its Exit into the World, and another for its
Nourishment, after it is come into the World, till the Bird is able to
shift for, and help it self; and that these Parts should be so accurately
brac’d, and kept in due Place[b], is certainly a design’d, as well as
curious Piece of Workmanship.

And then as to the Act it self, of _Incubation_, What a prodigious
Instinct is it in all, or almost all the several Species of Birds, that
they, and only they, of all Creatures, should betake themselves to this
very Way of Generation? How should they be aware that their Eggs contain
their Young, and that their Production is in their Power[c]? What should
move them to betake themselves to their Nests, and there with Delight and
Patience to abide the due Number of Days? And when their Young are gotten
into the World, I have already shewn how admirable their Art, their Care,
and Στοργὴ is in bringing them up until, and only until, they are able to
shift for themselves.

And lastly, when almost the whole Tribe of Birds, do thus by Incubation,
produce their Young, it is a wonderful Deviation, that some few Families
only, should do it in a more novercal Way[d], without any Care or
Trouble at all, only by laying their Eggs in the Sand, exposed to the
Heat and Incubation of the Sun. Of this the Holy Scripture it self
gives us an Instance in the Ostrich: Of which we have an Hint, _Lam._
iv. 3. _The Daughter of my People is become cruel, like the Ostriches
in the Wilderness._ This is more plainly expressed in _Job_ xxxix. 14,
15, 16, 17. _~[The Ostrich]~ leaveth her Eggs in the Earth, and warmeth
them in the Dust, and forgetteth that the Foot may crush them, or that
the Wild-Beast may break them. She is hardened against her Young ones,
as though they were not hers: Her Labour is in vain, without Fear.
Because God hath deprived her of Wisdom, neither hath he imparted unto
her Understanding._ In which Words I shall take notice of three Things,
1. Of this anomalous Way of Generation. It is not very strange, that
no other Incubation but that of the Sun, should produce the Young;
but ’tis very odd and wonderful that any one Species should vary from
all the rest of the Tribe. But above all, 2. The singular Care of the
Creator, in this Case, is very remarkable, in supplying some other Way
the Want of the Parent-Animals Care and Στοργὴ[e], so that the Young
should notwithstanding be bred up in those large and barren Desarts of
_Arabia_ and _Africa_, and such like Places where those Birds dwell,
the most unlikely and unfitting (in all human Opinion) to afford
Sustenance to young helpless Creatures; but the fittest therefore to
give Demonstrations of the Wisdom, Care, and especial Providence of the
infinite Creator and Conservator of the World. 3. The last Thing I shall
remark is, That the Instincts of Irrational Animals, at least of this
specified in the Text, is attributed to GOD. For the Reason the Text
gives why the _Ostrich is hardened against her young Ones, as though they
were not hers, is, Because _GOD_ hath deprived her of Wisdom, and not
imparted Understanding to her_; _i.e._ he hath denied her that Wisdom, he
hath not imparted that Understanding, that Στοργὴ, that natural Instinct
to provide for, and nurse up her Young, that most other Creatures of the
same, and other Tribes are endowed with.

Thus I have dispatched what I intend to insist upon concerning the State
of this Set of Animals; of which, as also of their admirable Instincts,
a great deal more might deserve our especial Observation; particularly
the admirable Curiosity, Art, and Variety of Nidification[f], used among
the various Species of Birds; the great Sagacity, and many Artifices
used by them in the Investigation and Capture of their Prey[g], the due
Proportion of the more and less useful, the Scarcity of the Voracious
and Pernicious, and the Plenty of the Mansuete and Useful[h]. Also the
Variety of their Motion and Flight might deserve Consideration, the
Swiftness of such whose Food is to be sought in far distant Places, and
different Seasons[i]; the slower Motion and short Flights of others more
domestick; and even the Aukwardness of some others to Flight, whose
Food is near at hand, and to be gotten without any great Occasion of
Flight[k]. These and divers other such like Things as these, I say, I
might have spoken more largely unto; but I shall pass them by with only a
bare Mention, having already taken notice of them in the Company of other
Matters of the like Nature, and manifested them to be Acts of excellent
Design, Wisdom, and Providence, in the great Creator.

[a] _The Chicken is form’d out of, and nourish’d by the White alone,
till it be grown great. The Yolk serves for the Chicken’s Nourishment,
after it is well grown, and partly also after it is hatch’d. For a
good Part of the Yolk remains after Exclusion, being receiv’d into the
Chicken’s Belly; and being there reserv’d, as in a Store-house, is by the
~Appendicula~, or ~Ductus intestinalis~, as by a Funnel, convey’d into
the Guts, and serves instead of Milk, ~&c.~_ Willugh. Ornith. L. 1. c. 3.
_Ipsum animal ex albo liquore Ovi corporatur. Cibus ejus in lutco est._
Plin. L. 10. c. 53.

_Aristotle_ saith, _The long sharp Eggs bring Females; the round ones,
with a larger Compass at the sharper End, Males._ Hist. An. L. 6. c.
2. After which, he tells of a Sott at _Syracuse_, that sate drinking
so long, till Eggs were hatch’d; as also of the Custom of _Ægypt_, of
hatching Eggs in Dunghills.

[b] As the Shell and Skin keep the Yolk and two Whites together; so
each of the Parts, (the Yolk and inner White at least,) are separated
by Membranes, involving them. At each End of the Egg is a Treddle, so
call’d, because it was formerly thought to be the Sperm of the Cock.
_But the Use of these_, (saith Dr. _Harvey_ in _Willugh. Ornith._ c. 3.)
_is to be as ’twere, the Poles of this Microcosm, and the Connections
of all the Membranes twisted and knit together, by which the Liquors
are not only conserv’d, each in its Place, but do also retain their due
Position one to another._ This, although in a great Measure true, yet
doth not come up to what I have my self observ’d; for I find, that these
_Chalazæ_, or _Treddles_, serve not barely to keep the Liquors in their
Place, and Position to one another; but also to keep one and the same
Part of the Yolk uppermost, let the Egg be turn’d nearly which way it
will; which is done by this Mechanism: The _Chalazæ_ are specifically
lighter than the Whites, in which they swim; and being brac’d to the
Membrane of the Yolk, not exactly in the _Axis_ of the Yolk, but somewhat
out of it; causeth one Side of the Yolk to be heavier than the other; so
that the Yolk being by the _Chalazæ_ made buoyant, and kept swimming in
the Midst of two Whites, is by its own heavy Side kept with the same Side
always uppermost; which uppermost Side I have some Reason to think, is
that on which the _Cicatricula_ lies; that being commonly uppermost in
the Shell, especially in some Species of Eggs more I think than others.

[c] All Birds lay a certain Number of Eggs, or nearly that Number,
and then betake themselves to their Incubation; but if their Eggs be
withdrawn, they will lay more. Of which, see Mr. _Ray_’s Wis. of God, p.
137.

[d] The _Tabon_ is a Bird no bigger than a Chicken, but is said to lay an
Egg larger than a Goose’s Egg, and bigger than the Bird it self. These
they lay a Yard deep in the Sand, where they are hatch’d by the Warmth
of the Sun; after which they creep out, and get to Sea for Provisions.
_Navarett_’s _Account of China in Collect. of Voyages_, Vol. 1. This
Account is in all Probability borrow’d from _Nieremberg_, or _Hernandez_,
(that copy’d from him,) who call this Bird by the Name of _Daie_, and its
Eggs _Tapun_, not the Bird it self, as _Navarette_ doth. But my Friend
Mr. _Ray_ saith of it, _Historia isthæc proculdubio fabulosa & falsa est.
Quamvis enim Aves nonnulla maxima ova pariunt, ut v.g. ~Alkæ~, ~Lomwiæ~,
~Anates~, ~Arcticæ~, &c. hujusmodi tamen unum duntaxat, non plura ova
ponunt antequam incubent: nec ullam in rerum naturâ avem dari existimo
cujus ova albumine careant. Cum Albumen præcipua ovi pars sit, quodque
primum fœtus alimentum subministrat._ Raii Synop. Av. Method. p. 155.

[e] _The Eggs of the Ostrich being buried in the Sand, are cherished only
by the Heat of the Sun, till the Young be excluded. For the Writers of
Natural History do generally agree, that the old Birds, after they have
laid and covered their Eggs in the Sand, forsake them, and take no more
Care of them._ Willugh. Ornith. L. 2. c. 8. §. 1.

But there is another _Ostrich_ [of _America_] which _Acaret_ tells us of,
that takes more Care of her Young, by carrying four of her Eggs, a little
before she hatcheth, to four Parts of her Nest, there to breed Worms for
Food for her Young. _Acaret’s Disc. in Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ. 89.

[k] The _Colymbi_, or _Douckers_, having their Food near at hand in
the Waters, are remarkably made for Diving therein. Their Heads are
small, Bills sharp-pointed, Wings small, Legs flat and broad, and placed
backward, and nearer the Tail than in Other Birds; and lastly, their
Feet; some are whole-footed, some cloven-footed, but withal fin-toed.

_The CONCLUSION._


And now, if we reflect upon the whole Matter, we shall here find another
large Tribe of the Creation, abundantly setting forth the Wisdom and
Glory of their great Creator. We praise the Ingenuity and Invention of
Man, for the Contrivance of various pneumatick Engines; we think them
witty, even for their unsuccessful Attempts to swim in, and sail through
that subtle Element the Air; and the curious Mechanism of that Artist
is had in Remembrance, and praised to this Day, who made a Dove, or an
_Eagle_[a] to fly but a short Space. And is not therefore all imaginable
Honour and Praise due to that infinite Artist, that hath so admirably
contrived and made, all the noble Variety of Birds; that hath with such
incomparable Curiosity and Art, formed their Bodies from Head to Tail,
without and within, that not so much as any Muscle, or Bone, no, not even
a Feather[b] is unartificially made, misplaced, redundant, or defective,
in all the several Families of this large Tribe? But every Thing is so
incomparably performed, so nicely fitted up for Flight, as to surpass
even the Imitation of the most ingenious Artificer among mortal rational
Beings.

_Of INSECTS in general._


Having dispatch’d that Part of the animal World, which used to be
accounted the more perfect, those Animals styled less perfect or
imperfect, will next deserve a Place in our Survey, because when strictly
enquired into, we shall find them to be so far from deserving to be
accounted mean and despicable Parts of the Creation, owing their Original
and Production to Putrefactions, _&c._ as some have thought, that we
shall find them, I say, noble, and most admirable Works of _GOD_. For,
as the famous Natural Historian, _Pliny_[a], prefaceth his Treatise of
_Insects_, to prevent the Reproach of condescending (as might be thought)
to so mean a Subject: _In great Bodies_, saith he, _Nature had a large
and easy Shop to work upon obsequious Matter. Whereas_, saith he, _in
these so small, and as it were no Bodies, what Footsteps of Reason, what
Power, what great Perfection is there?_ Of this having given an Instance
or two of the exquisite Senses, and curious Make of some Insects[b], he
then goes on, _We admire_, saith he, _turrigerous Shoulders of Elephants,
the lofty Necks and Crests of others; but_, saith he, _the Nature of
Things is never more compleat than in the least Things._ For which Reason
he intreats his Readers (as I do mine) _that because they slighted
many of the Things themselves which he took notice of, they would not
therefore disdainfully condemn his Accounts of them, since, saith he, in
the Contemplation of Nature, nothing ought to seem superfluous._

Thus that eminent Naturalist hath made his own, and my Excuse too; the
Force and Verity whereof will farther appear, by what I shall say of
these Animals which (as despicable as they have been, or perhaps may
be thought) we shall find as exquisitely contrived, and curiously made
for that Place and Station they bear in the World, as any other Part of
the Animal World. For if we consider the innumerable Variety of their
Species, the prodigious Numbers of Individuals, the Shape and Make
of their little Bodies, and every Part thereof, their Motion, their
Instincts, their regular Generation and Production; and, to name no more,
the incomparable Beauty and Lustre of the Colours of many of them, what
more admirable and more manifest Demonstration of the infinite Creator,
than even this little contemned Branch of the Animal World? But let us
take a short View of Particulars.

CHAP. II.

_Of the ~Shape~ and ~Structure~ of INSECTS._


Let us begin with the Shape and Fabrick of their Bodies. Which although
it be somewhat different from that of Birds, being particularly, for the
most part, not so sharp before, to cut and make way through the Air, yet
is better adapted to their manner of Life. For considering that there is
little Necessity of long Flights, and that the Strength and Activity of
their Wings doth much surpass the Resistance their Bodies meet with from
the Air, there was no great Occasion their Bodies should be so sharpened
before. But the Condition of their Food, and the Manner of gathering it,
together with the great Necessity of accurate Vision by that admirable
Provision made for them by the reticulated _Cornea_ of their Eyes; these
Things, I say, as they required a larger Room, so were a good Occasion
for the Largeness of the Head, and its Amplitude before. But for the rest
of their Body, all is well made, and nicely poised for their Flight, and
every other of their Occasions.

And as their _Shape_; so the _Fabrick_ and _Make_ of their Bodies is no
less accurate, admirable, and singular; not built throughout with Bones,
and cover’d with Flesh and Skin, as in most other Animals; but cover’d
with a curious Mail of a middle Nature[a], serving both as Skin and Bone
too, for the Shape, as well as Strength and Guard of the Body, and as it
were on Purpose to shew that the great Contriver of Nature is not bound
up to one Way only.

CHAP. III.

_Of the ~Eyes~ and ~Antennæ~ of INSECTS._


To this last-mention’d Guard, we may add, that farther Guard provided in
the _Eyes_ and _Antennæ_. The Structure of the Eye, is, in all Creatures,
an admirable Piece of Mechanism; but that observable in the Eyes of
Insects so peculiar, that it must needs excite our Admiration: Fenced
with its own Hardness, yea, even its own accurate Vision, is a good Guard
against external Injuries; and its _Cornea_, or outward Coat, all over
beset with curious, transparent, lenticular[a] Inlets, enabling those
Creatures to see, (no doubt,) very accurately every Way, without any
Interval of Time or Trouble to move the Eye towards Objects.

And as for the other Part, the _Antennæ_, or _Feelers_, whatever their
Use may be in cleaning the Eyes, or other such like use; they are, in all
Probability, a good Guard to the Eyes and Head, in their Walk and Flight,
enabling them, by the Sense of Feeling, to discover such Annoyances,
which by their Proximity may perhaps escape the Reach of the Eyes and
Sight[b]. Besides which, they are a curious Piece of Workmanship, and in
many, a very beautiful Piece of[c] Garniture to the Body.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] The _Cornea_ of Flies, Wasps, _&c._ are so common an Entertainment
with the Microscope, that every body knows it is a curious Piece of
Lattice-work. In which this is remarkable, that every _Foramen_ is of a
lenticular Nature; so that we see Objects through them topsey-turvey,
as through so many convex Glasses: Yea, they become a small Telescope,
when there is a due focal Distance between them and the _Lens_ of the
Microscope.

This lenticular Power of the _Cornea_, supplies, (as I imagine,) the
Place of the Crystalline, if not of the vitreous Humour too, there being
neither of those Humours that I could ever find, (although for Truth
Sake, I confess I have not been so diligent as I might in this Enquiry;)
but instead of _Humours_ and _Tunicks_, I imagine that every _Lens_ of
the _Cornea_, hath a distinct Branch of the _optick Nerve_ ministring to
it, and rendring it as so many distinct Eyes. So that as most Animals
are binocular, Spiders for the most Part octonocular, and some, (as Mr.
_Willughby_ thought, _Raii Hist. Insect._ p. 12.) senocular; so Flies,
_&c._ are multocular, having as many Eyes as there are Perforations in
their _Cornea_. By which Means, as other Creatures are oblig’d to turn
their Eyes to Objects, these have some or other of their Eyes ready
plac’d towards Objects, nearly all round them: Thus particularly it is
in the _Dragon-Fly_, (_Libella_,) the greatest Part of whose Head is
possess’d by its Eyes: Which is of excellent Use to that predatious
Insect, for the ready seeing and darting at small Flies all round it, on
which it preys.

[b] It is manifest, that Insects clean their Eyes with their Fore-legs,
as well as _Antennæ_. And considering, that as they walk along, they are
perpetually feeling, and searching before them, with their _Feelers_, or
_Antennæ_; therefore I am apt to think, that besides wiping and cleaning
the Eyes, the Uses here nam’d may be admitted. For as their Eyes are
immoveable, so that no Time is requir’d for the turning their Eyes to
Objects; so there is no Necessity of the _Retina_, or _optick Nerve_
being brought nigher unto, or set farther off from the _Cornea_, (which
would require Time,) as it is in other Animals: But their _Cornea_ and
_optick Nerve_, being always at one and the same Distance, are fitted
only to see distantial Objects, but not such as are very nigh: Which
Inconvenience the _Feelers_ obviate, lest it should be prejudicial, in
occasioning the Insect to run its Head against any Thing.

And that this, rather than the wiping the Eyes, is the chief Use of the
_Feelers_, is farther manifest from the _Antennæ_ of the _Flesh-Fly_,
and many other Insects, which are short, and strait, and incapable
of being bent unto, or extended over the Eyes: As also from others
enormously long, such as those of the _Capricorni_, or _Goat-chasers_,
the _Cadew-Fly_, and divers others, both Beetles and Flies.

[c] The lamellated _Antennæ_ of some, the clavellated of others, the
neatly articulated of others, the feather’d and divers other Forms of
others, of the _Scarab_, _Papilionaceous Gnat_, and other Kinds; are
surprizingly beautiful, when view’d through a Microscope. And in some,
those _Antennæ_ distinguish the Sexes: As in the _Gnat-kind_, all those
with Tufts, Feathers, and Brush-horns, are Males; those with short,
single shafted _Antennæ_, are Females.




CHAP. IV.

_Of the ~Parts~ and ~Motion~ of INSECTS._


From the Head, pass we to the Members, concern’d in their Motion.
And here we have a copious Subject, if I was minded to expatiate. I
might take Notice of the admirable Mechanism in those that creep; the
curious Oars in those amphibious Insects that swim and walk[a]; the
incomparable Provision made in the Feet of such as walk, or hang upon
smooth Surfaces[b]; the great Strength and Spring in the Legs of such as
leap[c]; the strong and well-made Feet and Talons of such as dig[d]: And
to name no more, the admirable Faculty of such as cannot fly, to convey
themselves with Speed and Safety, by the Help of their Webs[e], or some
other Artifice to make their Bodies lighter than the Air[f]: These, and
a Multitude of other such like Things as these, I might, I say, take
Notice of, as great Evidences of the infinite Creator’s Wisdom: But lest
I should be too tedious, I will confine my Observations to the Legs and
Wings only. And these, at first View, we find to be incomparably fitted
up for their intended Service, not to over-load the body, not in the
least to retard it; but to give it the most proper and convenient Motion.
What, for Example, can be better contriv’d, and made for this Service,
than the Wings? Distended and strengthen’d by the finest Bones, and these
cover’d with the finest and lightest Membranes, some of them adorn’d with
neat and beautiful Feathers[g]; and many of them provided with the finest
Articulations, and Foldings, for the Wings to be withdrawn, and neatly
laid up in their _Vaginæ_, and Cases, and again readily extended for
Flight[h].

And then for the Poising of the Body, and keeping it upright, and steady
in Flight, it is an admirable Artifice and Provision for this Purpose;
in some, by four Wings[i]; and in such as have but two, by Pointels, and
Poises plac’d under the Wings, on each Side the Body.

And lastly, It is an amazing Thing to reflect upon the surprizing
Minuteness, Art, and Curiosity of the[k] Joynts, the Muscles, the
Tendons, the Nerves, necessary to perform all the Motions of the Legs,
the Wings, and every other Part. I have already mention’d this in
the larger Animals; but to consider, that all these Things concur in
minute Animals, even in the smallest Mite; yea, the Animalcules, that,
(without good Microscopes,) escape our Sight; to consider, I say, that
those minutest Animals have all the Joynts, Bones, Muscles, Tendons
and Nerves, necessary to that brisk and swift Motion that many of them
have, is so stupendous a Piece of curious Art[l], as plainly manifesteth
the Power and Wisdom of the infinite Contriver of those inimitable
Fineries. But having nam’d those minute Animals, Why should I mention
only any one Part of their Bodies, when we have, in that little Compass,
a whole and compleat Body, as exquisitely form’d, and, (as far as our
Scrutiny can possibly reach,) as neatly adorn’d as the largest Animal?
Let us consider, that there we have Eyes, a Brain, a Mouth, a Stomach,
Entrails, and every other Part of an animal Body, as well as Legs
and Feet; and that all those Parts have each of them their necessary
_Apparatus_ of Nerves, of various Muscles, and every other Part that
other Insects have; and that all is cover’d and guarded with a well-made
Tegument, beset with Bristles, adorn’d with neat Imbrications, and many
other Fineries. And lastly, Let us consider in how little Compass all Art
and Curiosity may lie, even in a Body many Times less than a small Grain
of Sand[m]; so that the least Drop of Water can contain many of them, and
afford them also sufficient Room to dance and frisk about in[n].

Having survey’d as many of the Parts of Insects as I care to take
Notice of; I shall in the next Place say somewhat of their State, and
Circumstances of Life. And here I shall take Notice only of two Things,
which have been only hinted at before; but will deserve more particular
Consideration here, as being Acts of a wonderful Instinct; namely,
Their Security of themselves against Winter; and their special Care of
preserving their Species.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] All the Families of _Hydrocanthari_, _Notonecti_, &c. have their
hindmost Legs made very nicely, with commodious Joynts flat, and Bristles
on each Sides towards the End, serving for Oars to swim; and then, nearer
the Body, are two stiff Spikes, to enable them to walk when Occasion is.

[b] I might here name divers Flies, and other Insects, who, besides their
sharp hook’d Nails, have alto skinny Palms to their Feet, to enable them
to stick on Glass, and other smooth Bodies, by Means of the Pressure of
the Atmosphere. But because the Example will illustrate another Work of
Nature, as well as this, I shall chuse a singular Piece of Mechanism, in
one of the largest Sorts of _Hydrocanthari_. Of these large ones there
are two Sorts, one largest, all black, with _Antennæ_ handsomely emboss’d
at the Ends. The other somewhat lesser, hardly so black, with capillary
_Antennæ_; the Forehead, Edges of the _Vaginæ_, and two Rings on the
_Thorax_, of a tawney Colour. The Female hath _Vaginæ_ prettily furrow’d,
the Male smooth. But that which is most to our Purpose in this Male, is a
Flap, or hollowish Cap near the middle Joynt of the Fore-legs; which when
clap’d on the Shoulders of the Female _in Coitu_, sticks firmly thereon:
After the Manner as I have seen Boys carry heavy Stones, with only a wet
Piece of Leather clap’d on the Top of the Stone.

[c] Thus, _Grasshoppers_ and _Crickets_ have brawny strong Thighs, with
long, slender, but strong Legs, which enable them to leap with great
Agility and Strength.

[d] I have wonder’d to see with what great Quickness, Art and Strength,
many _Vespæ-Ichneumons_, _Wild-Bees_, and _Beetles_, perforate the Earth;
yea, even Wood it self: But the most remarkable Animal to this Way, is
the _Mole-Cricket_ in _Book IV. Chap. 13. Note (s)._

[e] I have with Pleasure often seen Spiders dart out their Webs, and
sail away by the Help thereof. For the Manner of which, see Mr. _Lowth_,
Abridg. _Vol. 2. p. 794._ from Dr. _Lister_ and Dr. _Hulse_, who both
claim’d the Discovery thereof. And do both seem to have hit thereupon,
without any Foreknowledge of what each other hath discover’d, as is said
in the last cited Place, and as I more particularly find by Mr. _Ray_’s
_Philos._ Letters, Printed _Ann. 1718_. p. 95, _&c._ By which also I find
the two ingenious Doctors were very modest in their Claims, and very
amicable in the Matter. In one of Dr. _Lister_’s to Mr. _Ray_, he thinks
there is a fair Hint of the Darting of Spiders in _Arist. Hist. An._ L.
9. c. 39. And in _Pliny_, L. 11. c. 24. But for their Sailing, that the
Ancients are silent of, and he thinks it was seen first by him. And in
another Letter, _Jan. 20, 1670_, speaking of the Height Spiders are able
to fly, he saith, _The last ~October~, &c. I took Notice, that the Air
was very full of Webs, I forthwith mounted to the Top of the highest
Steeple on the Minster, ~[in York,]~ and could thence discern them yet
exceeding high above me. Some that fell, and were intangled upon the
Pinacles, I took and found them to be ~Lupi~: which Kind seldom or never
enter Houses, and cannot be suppos’d to have taken their Flight from the
Steeple._

[f] There are, (I imagine,) divers Animals, as well as Spiders, that
have some Way of Conveyance, as little known to us, as that of Spiders
formerly was. Thus the _Squillulæ_, _pulices Arborescentes_, and
_microscopical Animalcules_ of the stagnating Waters, so numerous in
them, as to discolour sometimes the Water, and make them look as if they
were tinged Red, Yellow or Green, or cover’d with a thick green Scum; all
which is nothing but Animalcules of that Colour. That these Creatures
have some Way of Conveyance, I conclude: because most stagnating Waters
are stock’d with them; new Pits and Ponds, yea, Holes and Gutters on the
Tops of Houses and Steeples. That they are not bred there by æquivocal
Generation, every ingenious, considering Philosopher will grant; that
they have not Legs for travelling so far, is manifest from Inspection:
And therefore I am apt to think, that they have some Faculty of inflating
their Bodies, or darting out Webs, and making their Bodies buoyant,
and lighter than Air; or their Bodies, when dry, may be lighter than
Air, and so they can swim from Place to Place; or the Eggs of such as
are oviparous, may be light enough to float in the Air. But then the
Viviparous, (as my late ingenious Friend, Mr. _Charles King_, shew’d
me the _Pulices aquat. arbores._ are; these I say,) can’t be this Way
accounted for. The Cause of these latter Suspicions was, that in the
Summer Months, I have seen the _Pulices arbores._ and the green Scum on
the Waters, (nothing but Animalcules, as I said,) lie in a Manner dry on
the Surface of the Waters; at which Time, (as I have shewn in _Book IV.
Chap. 11. Note (n)_,) those Animalcules copulate; and perhaps, they may
at the same Time change their Quarters, and seek out new Habitations for
their numerous Offspring, as well as themselves.

[g] It is well known to all Persons any Way conversant in microscopical
Observations, that these elegant Colours of _Moths_, and _Butterflies_,
are owing to neat and well-made Feathers, set with great Curiosity and
Exactness in Rows, and good Order.

[h] All that have _Elytra_, _Scarabs_ (who have whole _Elytra_, or
reaching to the _Podex_,) or the Ἡμικουλεόπτεροι, such as _Earwigs_, and
_Staphylini_ of all Sorts, do, by a very curious Mechanism, extend and
withdraw their membranaceous Wings, (wherewith they chiefly fly;) and it
is very pretty to see them prepare themselves for Flight, by thrusting
out, and unfolding their Wings; and again withdraw those Joynts, and
neatly fold in the Membranes, to be laid up safely in their _Elytra_
or Cases. For which Service the Bones are well plac’d, and the Joynts
ministring thereunto are accurately contriv’d, for the most compendious,
and commodious folding up the Wings.

[i] For the keeping the Body steady and upright in Flight, it generally
holds true, (if I mistake not,) that all bipennated Insects have _Poises_
joyn’d to the Body, under the hinder Part of their Wings; but such as
have four Wings, or Wings with _Elytra_, none. If one of the Poises, or
one of the lesser auxiliary Wings be cut off, the Insect will fly as if
one Side overbalanc’d the other, until it falleth on the Ground; so if
both be cut of, they will fly aukwardly, and unsteadily, manifesting the
Defect of some very necessary Part. These _Poises_, or _Pointells_ are,
for the most Part, little Balls, set at the Top of a slender Stalk, which
they can move every Way at Pleasure. In some they stand alone, in others,
(as in the whole _Flesh-Fly_ Tribe,) they have little Covers or Shields,
under which they lie and move. The Use, no doubt, of these _Poises_, and
_secondary_ lesser Wings, is to poise the Body, and to obviate all the
Vacillations thereof in flight; serving to the Insect, as the long Pole,
laden at the Ends with Lead, doth the _Ropedancer_.

[k] As all the Parts of Animals are mov’d by the Help of these; so there
is, no doubt, but the minutest Animals have such like Parts: But the
Muscles and Tendons of some of the larger Insects, and some of the lesser
too, may be seen with a Microscope.

[l] The minute Curiosities, and inimitable Fineries, observable in those
lesser Animals, in which our best Microscopes discover no Botch, no rude
ill-made Work, (contrary to what is in all artificial Works of Man,) Do
they not far more deserve our Admiration, than those celebrated Pieces of
humane Art? Such as the Cup made of a Pepper-Corn, by _Oswald Nerlinger_,
that held 1200 ivory Cups, all gilt on the Edges, and having each of them
a Foot, and yet affording Room for 400 more, in the _Ephem. Germ._ T.
1. Addend. ad Obs. 13. Such also was _Phaëton_ in a Ring, which _Galen_
thus reflects upon, when he speaks of the Art and Wisdom of the Maker
of Animals, particularly such as are small, _Quanto_, saith he, _ipsum
minus fuerit, tanto majorem admirationem tibi excitabit; quod declarant
Opifices cùm in corporibus parvis aliquid insculpant: cujus generis est
quòd nuper quidam in Annulo Phaëtonta quatuor equis invectum sculpsit.
Omnes enim æqui frænum, os, & dentes anteriores habebant, ~&c.~_ And
then having taken Notice, that the Legs were no bigger than those of a
_Gnat_, he shews that their Make did not come up to those of the _Gnat_;
as also, saith he, _Major adhuc alia quædam esse videtur artis ejus, qui
Pulicem condidit, Vis atque Sapientia, quod, ~&c.~ Cùm igitur Ars tanta
in tam abjectis animalibus appareat,——quantam ejus Vim ac Sapientiam in
præstantioribus inesse putabimus?_ Galen. de Us. Part. L. 17. c. 1. fin.

[m] It will in some Measure appear, how wonderfully minute some
microscopical Animalcules are, by what follows in the next Note. But
because more particular Examples would be endless, I shall refer to the
Observations of Mr. _Leuwenhoeck_, and others, in the _Philos. Trans._
and elsewhere.

[n] It is almost impossible, by Reason of their perpetual Motion, and
changing Places, to count the Number of the Animalcules, in only a Drop
of the green Scum upon Water; but I guess I have sometimes seen not fewer
than 100 frisking about in a Drop no bigger than a Pin’s Head. But in
such a Drop of Pepper-water, a far greater Number; these being much less

_The ~Sagacity~ of INSECTS to secure themselves against Winter._


It is an extraordinary Act of Instinct and Sagacity, observable in
the generality of the Insect-Tribe, that they all take Care to secure
themselves, and provide against the Necessities of Winter. That when the
Distresses of Cold and Wet force them, they should retire to warm and
dry Places of Safety, is not strange; but it is a prodigious Act of the
infinite Conservator’s Care to enable some to live in a different Kind
of Insect-State; others to live, as without Action, so without Food;
and others that act and eat, to lay up in Summer sufficient Provisions
against the approaching Winter. Some, I say, live in a different State.
For having sufficiently fed, nourished, and bred up themselves to the
Perfection of their _Vermicular_, _Nympha-State_, in the Summer-Months,
they then retire to Places of Safety, and there throw off their _Nympha_,
and put on their _Aurelia_ or _Chrysalis-State_ for all the Winter, in
which there are no Occasions for Food. This is the constant Method of
many Families of the Insect-Tribe[a].

But there are others, and some of them in their most perfect State too,
that are able to subsist in a kind of Torpitude or Sleeping State,
without any Food at all; by Reason as there is no Action so no Waste of
Body, no Expence of Spirits, and therefore no need of Food[b].

But for others that move and act, and need Food, it is a prodigious
Instinct and Foresight the Creator hath imprinted on them, to lay up
sufficient Food in Summer for the Winter’s[c] Necessities and Occasions.
And it is very pretty to see with what unwearied Diligence all Hands
are at work for that Purpose, all the warmer Months. Of this the Holy
Scripture it self gives us an Instance in the _Ant_, calling that little
Animal _exceeding wise_, Prov. xxx. 24. And the Reason is, ℣. 25. _The
Ants are a People not strong, yet they prepare their Meat in the Summer._
And therefore _Solomon_ sends the Sluggard to this little contemptible
Creature, to learn Wisdom, Foresight, Care and Diligence, Prov. vi. 6, 7,
8. _Go to the Ant, thou Sluggard, consider her Ways, and be wise: which
having no Guide, Overseer, or Ruler, provideth her Meat in the Summer,
and gathereth her Food in the Harvest._

To this Scriptural Example, give me leave to anticipate, and subjoin an
Observation of the farther great Wisdom of this little Creature; and that
is their unparallelled Στοργὴ, their Tenderness, Sagacity, and Diligence
about their Young[d]. ’Tis very diverting, as well as admirable to
see, with what Affection and Care they carry about their Young in their
Mouths, how they expose themselves to the greatest Dangers, rather than
leave their Young exposed or forsaken; how they remove them from Place
to Place in their little Hills, sometimes to this Part, sometimes to
that, for the Benefit of convenient Warmth, and proper Moisture; and
then again withdraw, and guard them against Rain and Cold. Now that this
great Wisdom which the Scriptures attribute unto, and is discernible in
this little Animal, is owing only to the Instinct, or Infusions of the
great Conservator of the World, is evident, because either this Wisdom,
Thought, and Forecast, is an Act of the Animal it self, or of some other
Being that hath Wisdom. But the Animal being irrational, ’tis impossible
it can be its own Act, but must be derived, or received from some wise
Being. And who? What can that be, but the infinite Lord, Conservator and
Governour of all the World?


FOOTNOTES:

[a] It would be endless to enter into Particulars here, because all the
_Papilionaceous_, _Flesh_, and _Ichneumon-Fly_ Tribes, and all others
that undergo the _Nympha_ and _Aurelia_-State, between that of the Egg
and _Mature_-State, (which are very numerous) appertain to this Note. For
a Sample therefore only, I shall take what some may think a mean one, but
if considered, deserves our Admiration, and that is the Sagacity of the
_White Butter-fly Caterpiller_, which having fed it self its due Time,
then retires to Places of Security. I have seen great Trains of them
creeping up the Walls and Posts of the next Houses, where, with the help
of some Cobweb-like Filaments, they hang themselves to the Cielings, and
other commodious Places, and then become _Aureliæ_; in which State and
Places they hang secure from Wet and Cold, till the Spring and warmer
Months, when they are transmuted into Butter-Flies.

[b] I shall not name any of the particular Species of Insects which
live in this State, because they are very numerous, but only remark two
Things observable in their Sagacity in this Matter: 1. That they are not
driven by Stress of Weather to their Retirement, but seem as naturally
to betake themselves thereto, as other Animals do to Rest and Sleep. For
before the Approach of cold Weather, towards the End of Summer, we may
see some Kinds of them flocking together in great Numbers within Doors
(as _Swallows_ do a little before they leave us) as if they were making
ready for their Winter’s Rest. 2. That every Species betakes it self to
a proper convenient Receptacle; some under the Waters to the Bottoms of
Ponds; some under the Earth, below the Frosts; some under Timber, Stone,
&c. lying on the Ground; some into hollow Trees, or under the Bark, or in
the Wood; some into warm and dry Places; and some into dry alone.

[c] There are not many Kinds that thus provide their Food before-hand.
The most remarkable, are the _Ant_ and the _Bee_; concerning the first
of which, _Origen_ hath this Remark, _viz._ _De solertiâ Formicarum,
venturæ hyemi maturè prospiciontium, sibique invicem sub onere sessis
succurrentium; quódque fruges arrosas condunt, ne rursus enascantur, sed
per annum alimento sint, non ratiocinationem Formicarum in causâ debemus
credere, sed almam matrem Naturam bruta quoque sic ornantem, ut etiam
minimis addat sua quædam ingenia._ Orig. cont. Cels. L. 4.

But as for _Wasps_, _Hornets_, _Humble Bees_, and other _Wild-Bees_,
_Vespæ Ichneumons_, and divers others that carry in Materials for Nests
and Food; this is only for the Service of their Generation, for hatching
their Eggs, and nourishing their Young, not for Supplies in Winter;
for they all forsake their Nests towards Winter, and retire to other
Quarters, living (I conceive) without Food all that Time.

Sir _Edward King_, who was very curious in examining the Generation of
_Ants_, observes their great Care and Diligence, 1. About their Sperm,
or true Eggs, which is a fine white Substance, like Sugar, which they
diligently gather together into a Heap, when scattered; and on which they
lie in Multitudes. (I suppose, by way of Incubation.) 2. I have observed,
saith he, in Summer, that in the Morning they bring up those of their
Young (call’d Ant-Eggs) towards the Top of the Bank: So that you may from
10 in the Morning, until 5 or 6 Afternoon, find them near the Top——for
the most Part on the South-side the Bank. But towards 7 or 8 at Night,
if it be cool, or likely to rain, you may dig a Foot deep before you can
find them. _Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ. 23. or _Lowthorp_’s _Abridg._ V. 2. p. 7.

CHAP. VI.

_Of the Care of INSECTS about their ~Young~._


The other notable Instinct I am to treat of, is the peculiar Art and
Care of the Insect-Tribe, about the Preservation of their Species.
Here I might speak of many Things, but I have occasionally mentioned
divers of them before, under some or other of the general Heads, and
therefore shall fix only upon two Things relating to their special Art
and Care about the Production[a] of their Young, which have not been so
particularly spoken to as they deserve.

One Thing is their singular Providence for their Young, in making or
finding out such proper Receptacles and Places for their Eggs and Seed,
as that they may receive the Advantage of a sufficient Incubation,
and that the Young, when produced, may have the Benefit of proper and
sufficient Food for their Nurture and Education, till they are able to
shift for themselves. It is admirable to see with what Diligence and
Care the several Species of Insects lay up their Eggs or Sperm in their
several proper Places; not all in the Waters, in Wood, or on Vegetables;
but those whose Subsistence is in the Waters[b], in the Water; those to
whom Flesh is a proper Food; in Flesh[c]; those to whom the Fruits[d] or
Leaves of Vegetables are Food, are accordingly reposited, some in this
Fruit, some on this Tree[e], some on that Plant[f], some on another, and
another; but constantly the same Family on the same Tree or Plant, the
most agreeable to that Family. And as for others that require a constant
and greater Degree of Warmth, they are accordingly provided by the
Parent-Animal with some Place in or about the Body of other Animals; some
in the Feathers of Birds[g]; some in the Hair of Beasts[h]; some in the
very Scales of Fishes[i]; some in the Nose[k]; some in the Flesh[l]; yea,
some in the very Bowels[m]; and inmost Recesses of the Bodies of Man
and other Creatures[n]: And as for others to whom none of these Methods
are proper, but make themselves Nests by Perforations in the Earth, in
Wood, or Combs they build, or such like Ways; ’tis admirable to see
with what Labour and Care they carry in, and seal up Provisions, that
serve both for the Production of their Young, as also for their Food and
Nurture when produc’d[o].

The other Piece of remarkable Art and Care about the Production of their
Young, is their Curiosity and Neatness in repositing their Eggs, and in
their Nidification.

As to the first of which, we may observe that great Curiosity, and nice
Order is generally observ’d by them in this Matter. You shall always see
their Eggs laid carefully and commodiously up[p]. When upon the Leaves of
Vegetables, or other Material on Land, always glu’d thereon with Care,
with one certain End lowermost, and with handsom juxta-Positions[q].
Or if in the Waters, in neat and beautiful Rows oftentimes, in that
spermatick, gelatine Matter, in which they are reposited, and that Matter
carefully ty’d and fastned in the Waters, to prevent its Dissipation[r],
or if made to float, so carefully spread and poised, as to swim about
with all possible Artifice.

And as to their other Faculty, that of Nidification, whether it be
exerted by boring the Earth or Wood, or building themselves Cells[s],
or spinning and weaving themselves Cases and Webs, it is all a wonderful
Faculty of those poor little Animals, whether we consider their Parts
wherewith they work, or their Work it self. Thus those who perforate the
Earth, Wood, or such like, they have their Legs, Feet, Mouth, yea, and
whole Body accommodated to that Service; their Mouth exactly formed to
gnaw those handsome round Holes, their Feet as well made to scratch and
bore[t], and their Body handsomely turned and fitted to follow. But for
such as build or spin themselves Nests, their Art justly bids Defiance
to the most ingenious Artist among Men, so much as tolerably to copy the
nice Geometrical Combs of some[u], the Earthen Cells of others, or the
Webs, Nets and Cases[w] woven by others. And here that natural Glue[x]
which their Bodies afford some of them to consolidate their Work, and
combine its Materials together, and which in others can be darted out
at Pleasure, and spun and woven by them into silken Balls[y] or Webs.
I say, this so peculiar, so serviceable a Material, together with the
curious Structure of all Parts ministring to this textrine Power, as mean
a Business as it may seem, is such as may justly be accounted among the
noble Designs and Works of the infinite Creator and Conservator of the
World.

In the last Place, there is another prodigious Faculty, Art, Cunning, or
what shall I call it? that others of those little Animals have, to make
even Nature it self serviceable to their Purpose; and that is the making
the Vegetation and Growth of Trees and Plants, the very Means of the
building of their little Nests and Cells[z]; such, as are the Galls and
Balls found on the Leaves and Branches of divers Vegetables, such as the
Oak, the Willow[aa], the Briar, and some others.

Now this is so peculiar an Artifice, and so far out of the Reach of any
mortal Understanding, Wit, or Power, that if we consider the Matter, with
some of its Circumstances, we must needs perceive manifest Design, and
that there is the Concurrence of some great and wise Being, that hath,
from the Beginning, taken Care of, and provided for the Animal’s Good:
For which Reason, as mean as the Instance may seem, I might be excused,
if I should enlarge upon its Particulars. But two or three Hints shall
suffice.

In the first Place, ’tis certain that the Formation of those _Cases_ and
_Balls_ quite exceeds the Cunning of the Animal it self; but it is the
Act partly of the Vegetable, and partly of some Virulency (or what shall
I call it?) in the Juyce, or Egg, or both, reposited on the Vegetable
by the Parent Animal[bb]. And as this Virulency is various, according
to the Difference of its Animal, so is the Form and Texture of the
Cases and Balls excited thereby; some being hard Shells[cc], some tender
Balls[dd], some scaly[ee], some smooth[ff], some Hairy[gg], some Long,
some Round, some Conical, _&c._[hh]. And in the last Place, let us add,
That those Species of Insects are all endowed with peculiar and exactly
made Parts for this Service, to bore and pierce the Vegetable, and to
reach and inject their Eggs and Juice into the tender Parts thereof.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] The Doctrine of Æquivocal Generation, is at this Day so sufficiently
exploded by all learned Philosophers, that I shall not enter the
Dispute, but take it for granted, that all Animals spring from other
Parent-Animals. If the Reader hath any doubt about it, I refer him to
_Seigneur Redi de Gen. Insect._ and M. _Ray_’s _Wisd. of God_, &c. p.
344. See also before, _Book IV. Ch. 15. Note (a)._

[b] It would be endless to specify the various Species of Insects, that
have their Generation in the Waters. And therefore I shall only observe
of them, 1. That their Eggs are always laid up with great Care, and in
good Order. And also, 2. Where proper and sufficient Food is. 3. That in
their _Nympha_-State in the Waters, they have Parts proper for Food and
Motion; and in many, or most of them, very different from what they have
in their _Mature_-State, a manifest Argument of the Creator’s Wisdom and
Providence. For an Instance, see _Note (r)._

[c] As _Seigneur Redi_ was one of the first that made it his Business to
discard Anomalous Generation, so he tried more Experiments relating to
the Vermination of Serpents, Flesh, Fish, putrified Vegetables; and in
short, whatever was commonly known to be the Nursery of Maggots, more I
say probably, than any one hath done since. And in all his Observations,
he constantly found the Maggots to turn to _Aureliæ_, and these into
_Flies_. But then, saith he, _Dubitare cœpi, utrùm omne hoc vermium in
carne genus, ex solo Muscarum semine, an ex ipsis putrefactis carnibus
oriretur, tantoque magis confirmabar in hoc meo dubio, quanto in
omnibus generationibus——sapiùs videram, in carnibus, antequàm verminare
inciperent, resedisse ejusdem speciei Muscas, cujus propago postea
nascebatur._ Upon this he tells us, he put Fish, Flesh, _&c._ into Pots,
which he covered close from the Flies with Paper, and afterwards (for the
free Air sake) with Lawn, whilst other Pots were left open, with such
like Flesh, _&c._ in them; that the Flies were very eager to get into the
covered Pots; and that they produced not one Maggot, when the open ones
had many. _Fr. Redi de Gener._ _Insect._

Among the Insects that come from the Maggots he mentions, he names
_Culices_. Now from the most critical Observations I have made, I never
observed any sort of _Gnat_ to come from putrified Flesh, Vegetables, or
any other Thing he taxeth with them. So that either he means by _Culex_,
some Fly that we call not by the Name of _Gnat_; or else their _Gnats_ in
_Italy_, vary in their Generation from ours in _England_. For among above
30, near 40 distinct Species of _Gnats_ that I have observed about the
Place where I live, I never found any to lay their Eggs in Flesh, Filth,
_&c._ but the largest Sort, called by _Aldrovand_, _Culices maximi_, by
_Swammerdam_, _Tipulæ terrestres_, lay their Eggs in Meadows, _&c._ under
the Grass; one of the larger middle Sort, in dead Beer, Yeast, _&c._
lying on the Tops, or in the Leaks of Beer-Barrels, _&c._ and all the
rest (as far as ever I have observed) lay and hatch in the Waters, as in
_Note (r)._

The Generation of the Second of these being akin to some of the foregoing
instances, and a little out of the way, may deserve a Place here. This
_Gnat_ lays its Eggs commonly in dead Beer, _&c._ as I said, and probably
in Vinegar, and other such Liquors. Some Time after which, the Maggots
are so numerous, that the whole Liquor stirreth as if it was alive;
being full of Maggots, some larger, some smaller; the larger are the
off-spring of our _Gnat_, the smaller, of a small dark coloured Fly,
tending to reddish; frequent in Cellars, and such obscure Places. All
these _Maggots_ turn to _Aurelia_, the larger of which, of a Tan-Colour,
such as our _Gnat_. This _Gnat_ is of the unarmed Kind, having no Spear
in its Mouth. Its Head is larger than of the common _Gnats_, a longer
Neck, short jointed _Antennæ_, spotted Wings, reaching beyond its slender
_Alvus_; it is throughout of a brown Colour, tending to red, especially
in the Female: The chief Difference between the Male and Female, is (as
in other _Gnats_, yea, most Insects) the Male is less than the Female,
and hath a slenderer Belly, and its _Podex_ not so sharp as the Female’s
is.

[d] The Insects that infest Fruits, are either of the _Ichneumon-Fly_
Kind, or _Phalænæ_. Plums, Pease, Nuts, _&c._ produce some or other
_Ichneumon-Fly_. That generated in the _Plum_ is black, of a middle Size,
its _Body_ near ³⁄₁₀ Inch long, its Tail not much less, consisting of
three Bristles, wherewith it conveys its Eggs into Fruits: Its _Antennæ_,
or Horns, long, slender, recurved; its Belly longish, tapering, small
towards the _Thorax_; _Legs_ reddish; _Wings_ membranaceous, thin and
transparent, in Number 4, which is one Characteristic of the _Ichneumon
Fly_.

The _Pease Ichneumon-Fly_, is very small, Wings large, reaching beyond
the _Podex_; _Antennæ_ long; _Alvus_ short, shaped like an Heart, with
the Point towards the _Anus_; it walketh and flieth slowly. No Tail
appears as in the former; but they have one lieth hidden under the Belly,
which they can at Pleasure bend back to pierce Pease when they are young
and tender, and other Things also, as I have Reason to suspect, having
met with this (as indeed the former two) in divers Vegetables.

_Pears_ and _Apples_ I could never discover any Thing to breed in, but
only the lesser _Phalæna_, about ⁴⁄₁₀ Inch long, whitish underneath;
greyish brown above (dappled with brown Spots, inclining to a dirty Red)
all but about a third Part at the End of the Wings, which is not grey,
but brown, elegantly striped with wavey Lines, of a Gold Colour, as if
gilt; its Head is small, with a Tuft of whitish brown in the Forehead;
_Antennæ_ smooth, moderately long. The _Aurelia_ of this Moth is small,
of a yellowish brown. I know not what Time they require for their
Generation out of Boxes; but those I laid up in _August_, did not become
Moths before _June_ following.

[e] There are many of the _Phalænæ_ and _Ichneumon-Fly_ Tribes, that
have their Generation on the Leaves or other Parts of Trees and Shrubs,
too many to be here reckoned up. The _Oak_ hath many very beautiful
_Phalænæ_, bred in its convolved Leaves, white, green, yellow, brown
spotted prettily, and neatly dappled, and many more besides; and its
Buds afford a Place for Cases, and Balls of various Sorts, as shall be
shewn hereafter; its Leaves expanded, minister to the Germination of
globular, and other sphæroidal Balls, and flat _Thecæ_, some like Hats,
some like Buttons excavated in the Middle, and divers others such like
Repositories, all belonging to the _Ichneumon-Fly_ Kind. And not only the
_Oak_, but the _Maple_ also, the _White-Thorn_, the _Briar_, _Privet_,
and indeed almost every Tree and Shrub.

[f] And as Trees and Shrubs, so Plants have their peculiar Insects. The
_White-Butterfly_ lays its voracious Offspring on Cabbage-Leaves; a very
beautiful reddish ocellated one, its no less voracious black Off-spring
of an horrid Aspect, on the Leaves of Nettles; as also doth a very
beautiful, small, greenish _Ichneumon-Fly_, in Cases on the Leaves of
the same Plant: And to name no more (because it would be endless) the
beautiful _Ragwort-Moth_, whose upper Wings are brown, elegantly spotted
with red and underwings edged with brown; these, I say, provide for their
golden ring’d _Eruce_ upon the _Ragwort-Plant_.

[g] Many, if not most Sort of Birds, are infested with a distinct Kind of
Lice, very different from one another in Shape, Size, _&c._ For Figures
and Descriptions of them, I shall refer to _Signieur Redi of Insects_.
See also _Moufet_, L. 2. _c. 23._ These Lice lay their Nits among the
Feathers of the respective Birds, where they are hatched and nourished;
and as _Aristotle_ saith, would destroy the Birds, particularly
_Pheasants_, if they did not dust their Feathers. _Loco infr. citat._

[h] And as Birds, so the several Sorts of Beasts have their peculiar
Sorts of Lice; all distinct from the two Sorts infesting Man: Only the
_Ass_, they say, is free, because our _Saviour_ rode upon one, as some
think; but I presume it is rather from the Passage in _Pliny_, L. 11.
c. 33. or rather _Arist. Hist. Animal_. L. 3. c. 31. who saith, _Quibus
pilus est, non carent eodem ~[Pediculo]~ excepto Asino, qui non Pediculo
tantùm, verùm etiam Redivio immunis est._ And a little before, speaking
of those in Men, he shews what Constitutions are most subject to them,
and instanceth in _Alcman_ the Poet, and _Pherecydes Syrius_ that died
of the _Pthiriasis_, or Lowly Disease. For which foul Distemper, if
Medicines are desired, _Moufet de Insect._ p. 261. may be consulted. Who
in the same Page hath this Observation, _Animadverterunt nostrates——ubi
Asores insulas à tergo reliquerint, Pediculos confestim omnes tabascere:
atque ubi eas reviserint, iterum innumeros alios subitò oriri._ Which
Observation is confirmed by Dr. _Stubs._ Vid. _Lowth. Abridg._ V. 3. p.
558. And many Seamen have told me the same.

[i] Fishes, one would think, should be free from Lice, by Reason they
live in the Waters, and are perpetually moving in, and brushing through
them; but yet have their Sorts too.

Besides which, I have frequently found great Numbers of long slender
Worms in the Stomachs, and other Parts of Fish, particularly _Codfish_,
especially such as are poor; which Worms have work’d themselves deeply
into the Coats and Flesh, so that they could nor easily be gotten out:
So _Aristotle_, saith of some Fishes, _Ballero & Tilloni Lumbricus,
innascitur, qui debilitat, ~&c.~ Chalcis vitio infestatur diro, ut
Pediculi sub Branchiis innati quàm multi interimant._ Hist. An. L. 8. c.
20.

[k] Of Insects bred in the Nose of Animals, those in the Nostrils of
_Sheep_ are remarkable. I have my self taken out not fewer at a Time than
twenty or thirty rough Maggots, lying among the _Laminæ_ of the Nostrils.
But I could never hatch any of them, and so know not what Animal they
proceed from: But I have no great doubt, they are of the _Ichneumon-Fly_
Kind; and not improbably of that with a long Tail, call’d _Triseta_,
whose three Bristles seem very commodious for conveying its Eggs into
deep Places.

I have also seen a rough whitish Maggot, above two Inches within the
_Intestinum rectum_ of Horses, firmly adhering thereto, that the hard
Dung did not rub off. I never could bring them to Perfection, but suspect
the _Side-Fly_ proceeds from it.

[l] In the Backs of _Cows_, in the Summer-Months, there are Maggots
generated, which in _Essex_ we call _Wornils_; which are first only a
small Knot in the Skin; and I suppose no other than an Egg laid there by
some Insect. By Degrees these Knots grow bigger, and contain in them a
Maggot lying in a purulent Matter: They grow to be as large as the End of
one’s Finger, and may be squeez’d out at a Hole they have always open:
They are round and rough, and of a dirty White. With my utmost Endeavour
and Vigilance, I could never discover the Animal they turn into; but as
they are somewhat like, so may be the same as those in the Note before.

In _Persia_ there are very long slender Worms, bred in the Legs, and
other Parts of Men’s Bodies, 6 or 7 Yards long. In _Philos. Trans._ Mr.
_Dent_, and Mr. _Lewis_, relate divers Examples of _Worms_ taken out of
the Tongue, Gums, Nose, and other Parts, by a Woman at _Leicester_, which
they were Eye-witnesses of. These, and divers others mention’d in the
_Transactions_, may be seen together in Mr. _Lowthorp_’s _Abridg._ Vol.
3. p. 132.

together, in number about twenty._ Aristot. Hist. Animal. l. 2. c. 15.

To these Examples may be added the Generation of the _Ichneumon-Fly_
in the Bodies of Caterpillars, and other _Nymphæ_ of Insects. In many
of which, that I have laid up to be hatch’d in Boxes, instead of
_Papilios_, &c. as I expected, I have found a great Number of small
_Ichneumon-Flies_, whose Parent-Animal had wounded those _Nymphæ_, and
darted its Eggs into them, and so made them the Foster-Mother of its
Young. More Particulars of this Way of Generation may be seen in the
great Mr. _Willughby_’s Observations in _Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ. 76. But
concerning the farther Generation of this Insect, I have taken Notice of
other Particulars in other places of these Notes.

[m] The Animals ordinarily bred in the Stomach and Guts, are the three
Sorts of Worms call’d _Lati_, _Teretes_, and _Ascarides_; concerning
which, it would be irksome to speak in Particular, and therefore I shall
refer to _Moufet_, L. 2. c. 31, 32, 33. Dr. _Tyson_’s Anatomy of them in
Mr. _Lowthorp_’s _Abridg._ V. 3. p. 121. _Seignior Redi_’s _Obs_. and
others that have written of them.

And not only _Worms_, but other Creatures also are said to be found in
the Stomach; Instances of which are so innumerable, that I shall only
select a few related by Persons of the best Credit. And first of all, by
some of our own Countrymen. Dr. _Lister_, (whose Credit and Judgment will
hastily be question’d,) gives an Account of true _Caterpillars_, vomited
up by a Boy of nine Years old; and another odd Animal by a poor Man. Mr.
_Jessop_, (another very judicious, curious and ingenious Gentleman,) saw
_Hexapods_ vomited up by a Girl; which _Hexapods_ liv’d and fed for five
Weeks. See _Lowth._ ib. p. 135.

And to Foreigners, it is a very strange Story (but attested by Persons
of great Repute,) of _Catharina Geileria_, that dy’d in _Feb_. 1662, in
the Hospital of _Altenburg_, in _Germany_, who for twenty Years voided by
Vomit and Stool, _Toads_ and _Lizzards_, &c. _Ephemer. Germ._ T. 1. Obs.
103. See also the 109. Observation of a Kitten bred in the Stomach, and
vomited up; of Whelps also, and other Animals, bred in like Manner. But
I fear a Stretch of Fancy might help in some of those last Instances, in
those Days when spontaneous Generation was held, when the Philosophers
seem to have more slightly examined such Appearances than now they do.
But for the breeding of _Frogs_ or _Toads_, or _Lacertæ Aquaticæ_ in the
Stomach, when their Spawn happeneth to be drank, there is a Story in the
second _Tome_ of the _Ephem. Germ._ Obs. 56. that favours it, _viz._ _In
the Year 1667, a ~Butcher’s~ Man going to buy some Lambs in the Spring,
being thirsty, drank greedily of some standing Water, which a while
after, caus’d great Pains in his Stomach, which grew worse and worse, and
ended in dangerous Symptoms. At last he thought somewhat was alive in his
Stomach, and after that, vomited up three live Toads; and so recover’d
his former Health._

Such another Story Dr. _Sorbait_ tells, and avoucheth it seen with his
own Eyes, of one that had a Toad came out of an Abscess, which came upon
drinking foul Water. _Obs._ 103.

[n] Not only in the Guts, and in the Flesh; but in many other Parts of
the Body, Worms have been discover’d. One was voided by Urine, by Mr.
_Mat. Milford_, suppos’d to have come from the Kidneys. _Lowth._ ib.
p. 135. More such Examples _Moufet_ tells of. _Ibid._ So the _Vermes
Cucurbitini_ are very common in the Vessels in Sheeps Livers: And Dr.
_Lister_ tells of them, found in the Kidney of a Dog, and thinks that
the Snakes and Toads, _&c._ said to be found in Animals Bodies, may be
nothing else. _Lowth._ ib. p. 120. Nay, more than all this: In Dr. _Bern.
Verzascha_’s sixth Observation, there are divers Instances of Worms bred
in the _Brain_ of Man. One, a patient of his, troubled with a violent
Headach, and an itching about the Nostrils, and frequent Sneezing; who,
with the Use of a Sneezing-Powder, voided a Worm, with a great deal of
Snot from his Nose. A like Instance he gives from _Bartholine_, of a Worm
voided from the Nose of _O. W._ which he guesseth was the famous _Olaus
Wormius_: Another, from a Country Woman of _Dietmarsh_; and others in
_Tulpius_, _F. Hildanus_, _Schenchius_, &c. These Worms he thinks are
undoubtedly bred in the Brain: But what way they can come from thence,
I can’t tell. Wherefore I rather think, they are such Worms as are
mentioned in _Note (k)_, and even that Worm that was actually found in
the Brain of the _Paris Girl_ (when opened) I guess might be laid in the
_Laminæ_ of the Nostrils, by some of the _Ichneumon_, or other Insect
Kind, and might gnaw its way into the Brain, through the _Os cribiforme_.
Of this he tells us from _Bartholine_, _Tandem cùm tabida obiisset,
statim aperto cranio præsentes Medici totam cerebelli substantiam, quæ ad
dexterum vergit, à reliquo corpore sejunctam, nigrâque tunicâ involutam
deprehenderunt: hæc tunica ruptæ, latentem Vermem vivum, & pilosum,
duobus punctis splendidis loco oculorum prodidit, ejusdem fere molis
cum reliquâ Cerebri portione, qui duarum horaram spacio supervixit._ B.
Verzas. Obs. Medicæ, p. 16.

_Hildanus_ tells us such another Story, _viz._ _Filius Theod. aust
der Roulen, Avunculi mei, diuturno vexabatur dolore capitis.——Deinde
febriculâ & sternutatione exortâ, ruptus est Abscessus circa os
cribrosum——& Vermis prorepsit._ By his Figure of it, the Maggot was an
Inch long, and full of Bristles. _Fabri Hildan. Cent._ 1. Obs.

_Galenus Wierus_ (Physician to the _Princ. Jul. & Cleve_) he saith, told
him, that he had, at divers Times, found Worms in the _Gall-bladder_ in
Persons he had opened at _Dusseldorp_. Id. ib. Obs. 60.

[o] See before _Book IV. Chap. 13. Note (c)._

[p] Some Insects lay up their Eggs in Clusters, as in Holes of Flesh,
and such Places, where it is necessary they should be crowded together;
which, no question, prevents their being too much dried up in dry Places,
and promotes their hatching. But,

[q] As for such as are not to be clustered up, great Order is used.
I have seen upon the Posts and Sides of Windows, little round Eggs,
resembling small Pearl, which produced small hairy Caterpillars, that
were very neatly and orderly laid. And to name no more, the _White
Butterfly_ lays its neat Eggs on the Cabbage Leaves in good Order,
always gluing one certain End of the Egg to the Leaf. I call them neat
Eggs, because if we view them in a Microscope, we shall find them very
curiously furrowed, and handsomely made and adorned.

[r] By Reason it would be endless to specify the various Generation of
Insects in the Water, I shall therefore (because it is little observed)
raise _Pliny_’s Instance of the _Gnat_, a mean and contemned Animal, but
a notable Instance of Nature’s Work, as he saith.

The first Thing considerable in the Generation of this Insect is (for
the Size of the Animal) its vast _Spawn_, being some of them above an
Inch long, and half a quarter Diameter; made to float in the Waters,
and tied to some Stick, Stone, or other fix’d Thing in the Waters, by
a small Stem, or Stalk. In this gelatine, transparent Spawn, the Eggs
are neatly laid; in some Spawns in a single, in some in a double spiral
Line, running round from end to end, as in Fig. 9, and 10; and in some
transversly, as Fig. 8.

When the Eggs are by the Heat of the Sun, and Warmth of the Season
hatched into small Maggots, these Maggots descend to the bottom, and
by means of some of the gelatine Matter of the Spawn (which they take
along with them) they stick to Stones, and other Bodies at the bottom,
and there make themselves little Cases or Cells, which they creep
into, and out of at Pleasure, until they are arrived to a more mature
_Nympha-State_, and can swim about here and there, to seek for what Food
they have occasion; at which Time, they are a kind of Red-worms, above
half an Inch long, as in Fig. 11.

Thus far this mean Insect is a good Instance of the divine Providence
towards it. But if we farther consider, and compare the three States
it undergoes after it is hatched, we shall find yet greater Signals of
the Creator’s Management, even in these meanest of Creatures. The three
States I mean, are its _Nympha-Vermicular_ State, its _Aurelia_, and
_Mature_-State, all as different as to Shape and Accoutrements, as if
the Insect was three different Animals. In its _Vermicular_-State, it is
a Red-Maggot, as I said, and hath a Mouth and other Parts accommodated
to Food: In its _Aurelia_-State it hath no such Parts, because it then
subsists without Food; but in its _Mature_, _Gnat_-State, it hath a
curious well-made Spear, to wound and suck the Blood of other Animals.
In its _Vermicular_-State, it hath a long Worm-like Body, and something
analogous to Fins or Feathers, standing erect near its Tail, and running
parallel with the Body, by means of which resisting the Waters, it is
enabled to swim about by Curvations, or flapping its Body, side-ways,
this way and that, as in Fig. 12.

But in its _Aurelia_-State, it hath a quite different Body, with a
_Club-Head_ (in which the Head, _Thorax_, and Wings of the _Gnat_ are
inclosed) a slender _Alvus_, and a neat _finny Tail_, standing at right
Angles with the Body, quite contrary to what it was before; by which
means, instead of easy flapping side-ways, it swims by rapid, brisk
Jirks, the quite contrary way; as is in some measure represented in Fig.
13. But when it becomes a _Gnat_, no finny Tail, no Club-Head, but all
is made in the most accurate manner for Flight and Motion in the Air, as
before it was for the Waters.

[s] See _Book IV. Chap. 13. Notes (n), (o)._

[t] Thus the Mouths and other Parts of the _Ichneumon-Wasps_ in _Book IV.
Chap. 13. Note (t)._ So the Feet of the _Gryllotalpa_, _ibid._ _Note (s)._

[u] See the last cited Places, _Note (o)._

[w] Of the textrine Art of the _Spider_, and its Parts serving to that
Purpose, see the last cited Place, _Note (x)._

Besides these, _Caterpillars_, and divers other Insects, can emit
Threads, or Webs for their Use. In this their _Nympha-State_, they secure
themselves from falling, and let themselves down from the Boughs of
Trees, and other high Places, with one of these Threads. And in the Cases
they weave, they secure themselves in their _Aurelia-State_.

And not only the Off-spring of the _Phalæna-Tribe_, but there are some
of the _Ichneumon-Fly_ Kind also, endowed with this textrine Art. Of
these I have met with two Sorts; one that spun a Milk-white, long, round,
silken Web, as big as the top of ones Fingers, not hollow within, as
many are, but filled throughout with Silk. These are woven round Bents,
Stalks of Ribwort, &c. in Meadows. The other is a lump of many yellow,
silken Cases, sticking confusedly together on Posts, under Cole-worts,
_&c._ These Webs contain in them, small, whitish Maggots; which turn
to a small, black, _Ichneumon-Fly_, with long, capillary _Antennæ_;
Tan-coloured Legs; long Wings reaching beyond their Body, with a black
Spot near the middle; the _Alvus_, like an Heart; and in some, a small
setaceous Tail. Some of these Flies were of a shining, beautiful green
Colour. I could not perceive any Difference, at least, not specifical,
between the Flies coming from those two Productions.

[x] I have often admired how _Wasps_, _Hornets_, _Ichneumon-Wasps_, and
other Insects that gather dry Materials for building their Nests, have
found a proper matter to cement and glue their Combs, and line their
Cells; which we find always sufficiently context and firm. But in all
Probability, this useful Material is in their own Bodies; as ’tis in
the _Tinea vestivora_, the _Cadew Worm_, and divers others. _Goedart_
observes of his _Eruca_, _Num._ xx. 6. that fed upon _Sallow-Leaves_,
that it made its Cell of the comminuted Leaves, glued together with its
own Spittle, _hæc pulveris aut arenæ instar comminuit, ac pituitoso
quodam sui corporis succo ita maceravit, ut inde accommodatum subeundæ
mutationi instanti locum sibi extruxerit. Domuncula hæc à communi Salicum
ligno nihil differre videbatur, nisi quòd longè esset durior, adeò ut
cultro vix disrumpi posset._

[y] _An ingenious Gentlewoman of my Acquaintance, Wife to a learned
Physician, taking much Pleasure to keep Silk-Worms, had once the
Curiosity to draw out one of the oval Cases, which the Silk-Worm
spins——into all the Silken Wire it was made up of, which, to the great
Wonder as well of her Husband, as her self,——appeared to be, by measure,
a great deal above 300 Yards, and yet weighed but two Grains and an
half._ Boyl Subtil. of Effluv. ch. 2.

[z] Since my penning this, I have met with the most sagacious
_Malpighi_’s Account of _Galls_, &c. and find his Descriptions to
be exceedingly accurate and true, having traced my self many of the
Productions he hath mentioned. But I find _Italy_ and _Sicily_ (his
Book _de Gallis_ being published long after he was made Professor
of _Messina_) more luxuriant in such Productions than _England_, at
least, than the Parts about _Upminster_ (where I live) are. For many,
if not most of those about us, are taken Notice of by him, and several
others besides that I never met with; although I have for many Years as
critically observed all the Excrescences, and other morbid Tumors of
Vegetables, as is almost possible, and do believe that few of them have
escaped me.

As to the Method how those _Galls_ and _Balls_ are produced, the most
simple, and consequently the most easy to be accounted for, is that in
the Gems of Oak, which may be called _Squamous-Oak-Cones_, _Capitula
squamata_, in _Malpighi_: Whose Description not exactly answering our
_English-Cones_ in divers Respects, I shall therefore pass his by, and
shew only what I have observed my self concerning them.

These _Cones_ are, in outward Appearance, perfectly like the Gems, only
vastly bigger; and indeed they are no other than the Gems, encreased in
Bigness, which naturally ought to be pushed out in Length: The Cause of
which Obstruction of the Vegetation is this: Into the very Heart of the
young tender Gem or Bud (which begins to be turgid in _June_, and to
shoot towards the latter end of that Month, or beginning of the next;
into this, I say) the Parent-Insect thrusts one or more Eggs, and not
perhaps without some venomous Ichor therewith. This Egg soon becomes
a Maggot, which eats it self a little Cell in the very Heart or Pith
of the Gem, which is the Rudiment of the Branch, together with its
Leaves and Fruit, as shall be hereafter shewn. The Branch being thus
wholly destroyed, or at least its Vegetation being obstructed, the Sap
that was to nourish it, is diverted to the remaining Parts of the Bud,
which are only the scaly Teguments; which by these Means grow large and
flourishing, and become a Covering to the Insect-Case, as before they
were to the tender Branch and its Appendage.

The _Case_ lying within this Cone, is at first but small, as the Maggot
included in it is, but by degrees, as the Maggot increaseth, so it
grows bigger, to about the Size of a large white Pease, long and round,
resembling the Shape of a small Acorn.

The _Insect_ it self, is (according to the modern Insectologers) of the
_Ichneumon-Fly_ Kind; with four Membranaceous _Wings_, reaching a little
beyond the Body, articulated _Horns_, a large _Thorax_, bigger than the
Belly; the _Belly_ short and conical; much like the Heart of Animals: The
_Legs_ partly whitish, partly black. The _Length_ of the Body from Head
to Tail, about ²⁄₁₀ of an Inch; its _Colour_, a very beautiful shining
Green, in some tending to a dark Copper-Colour. Figures both of the
Cones, Cases, and Insects, may be seen among _Malpighi_’s Cuts of Galls,
Tab. 13. and Tab. 20. Fig. 72. which Fig. 72. exhibits well enough some
others of the _Gall-Insects_, but its _Thorax_ is somewhat too short for
ours.

[aa] Not only the Willow, and some other Trees, but Plants also, as
_Nettles_, _Ground-Ivy_, &c. have Cases produced on their Leaves, by
the Injection of the Eggs of an _Ichneumon-Fly_. I have observed those
Cases always to grow in, or adjoining to some Rib of the Leaf, and their
Production I conceive to be thus, _viz._ The Parent-Insect, with its
stiff setaceous Tail, terebrates the Rib of the Leaf, when tender, and
makes Way for its Egg into the very Pith or Heart thereof, and probably
lays in therewith, some proper Juice of its Body, to pervert the regular
Vegetation of it. From this Wound arises a small Excrescence, which (when
the Egg is hatched into a Maggot) grows bigger and bigger, as the Maggot
increases, swelling on each Side the Leaf between the two Membranes, and
extending it self into the parenchymous Part thereof, until it is grown
as big as two Grains of Wheat. In this Case lies a small, white, rough
Maggot, which turns to an _Aurelia_, and afterwards to a very beautiful
green, small _Ichneumon-Fly_.

[bb] What I suspected my self, I find confirmed by _Malpighi_, who in his
exact and true Description of the Fly bred in the _Oaken Galls_, saith,
_Non sat fuit naturæ tam miro artificio Terebram seu Limam condidisse;
sed inflicto vulnere, vel excitato foramine infundendum exinde liquorem
intra Terebram condidit: quare fractâ per transversam muscarum terebrâ
frequentissimè, vivente animali, guttæ aliquot diaphani humoris
effluunt._ And a little after, he confirms, by ocular Observation,
what he imagin’d before, viz. _Semel prope Junii finem vidi Muscam,
qualem superiùs delineavi, insidentum quercinæ gemmæ, adhuc germinanti;
hærebat etenim foliola stabili ab apice hiantis gemmæ erumpenti;
& convulso in arcum corpore, terebram evaginabat, ipsamque sensam
immittebat; & tumefacto ventre circa terebræ radicem tumorem excitabat,
quem interpolatis vicibus remittebat. In folio igitur, avulsà Muscâ,
minima & diaphana reperii ejecta ova, simillima iis, quæ adhuc in tubis
supererant. Non licuit iterum idem admirari spectaculum, ~&c.~_

Somewhat like this, which _Malpighi_ saw, I had the good Fortune to
see my self once some Years ago: And that was, the beautiful, shining
_Oak-Ball Ichneumon_ strike its _Terebræ_ into an Oak-Apple divers Times,
no doubt to lay its Eggs therein. And hence I apprehend we see many
_Vermicules_ towards the Outside of many of the Oak-Apples, which I guess
were not what the Primitive Insects laid up in the Gem, from which the
Oak-Apple had its Rise, but some other supervenient, additional Insects,
laid in after the Apple was grown, and whilst it was tender and soft.

[cc] The _Aleppo-Galls_, wherewith we make Ink, may be reckoned of this
Number, being hard, and no other than Cases of Insects which are bred in
them; who when come to Maturity, gnaw their Way out of them; which is
the Cause of those little Holes observable in them. Of the Insects bred
in them, see _Philos. Transact._ Nᵒ. 245. Of this Number also are those
little smooth Cases, as big as large Pepper-Corns, growing close to the
Ribs under Oaken-Leaves, globous, but flattish; at first touched with
a blushing red, afterwards growing brown; hollow within, and an hard
thin Shell without. In this lieth commonly a rough, white Maggot, which
becomes a little long winged, black _Ichneumon-Fly_, that eats a little
Hole in the Side of the Gall, and so gets out.

[dd] For a Sample of the tender Balls, I shall choose the globous Ball,
as round, and some as big as small Musket-Bullets, growing close to the
Ribs, under Oaken-Leaves, of a greenish yellowish Colour, with a blush
of red; their Skin smooth, with frequent Risings therein. Inwardly
they are very soft and spongy; and in the very Center is a Case with a
white Maggot therein, which becomes an _Ichneumon-Fly_, not much unlike
the last. As to this Gall, there is one Thing I have observed somewhat
peculiar, and I may say providential, and that is, that the Fly lies
all the Winter in these Balls in its Infantile-State, and comes not
to its Maturity till the following Spring. In the Autumn, and Winter,
these Balls fall down with their Leaves to the Ground, and the Insect
inclosed in them is there fenced against the Winter Frosts, partly by
other Leaves falling pretty thick upon them, and especially by the thick,
parenchymous, spongy Walls, afforded by the _Galls_ themselves.

Another Sample shall be the large _Oak-Balls_, called _Oak-Apples_,
growing in the Place of the Buds, whose Generation, Vegetation and
Figure, may be seen in _Malpig. de Gallis_, p. 24. and Tab. 10. Fig. 33,
_&c._ Out of these Galls, he saith various Species of Flies come, but he
names only two, and they are the only two I ever saw come out of them:
_Frequenter_ (saith he) _subnigræ sunt muscæ brevi munitæ terebrâ. Inter
has aliquæ observantur aureæ, levi viridis tincturâ suffusæ, oblongâ
pollentes terebrâ._ These two differently coloured Flies, I take to be no
other than Male and Female of the same Species. I have not observed Tails
(which are their _Terebræ_) in all, as _Malpighi_ seems to intimate:
Perhaps they were hid in their _Thecæ_, and I could not discover them:
But I rather think there were none, and that those were the Males: But in
others, I have observed long, recurvous Tails, longer than their whole
Bodies. And these I take to be the Females. And in the _Oak-Apples_
themselves, I have seen the _Aureliæ_, some with, some without Tails. And
I must confess, ’twas not without Admiration as well as Pleasure, that
I have seen with what exact Neatness and Artifice, the Tail hath been
wrapt about the _Aurelia_, whereby it is secured from either annoying the
Insect, or being hurt it self.

[ee] See before _Note (z)._

[ff] As in the preceding Note.

[gg] Of the rough or hairy Excrescences, those on the _Briar_, or
_Dog-Rose_, are a good Instance. These _Spongiolæ villosæ_, as Mr. _Ray_,
_Gallæ rumosæ_, as Dr. _Malpighi_ calls them, are thus accounted for by
the latter; _Ex copiosis relictis ovis ita turbatur affluens ~[Rubi]~
succus, ut strumosa fiant complura tubercula simul confusè congesta,
quæ utriculorum seriebus, & fibrarum implicatione contexta, ramosas
propagines germinant, ita ut minima quasi sylva appareat. Qualibet
propago ramos, hinc inde villosos edit. Hinc inde pili pariter crumpunt,
~&c.~_

These Balls are a safe Repository to the Insect all the Winter in its
Vermicular-State. For the Eggs laid up, and hatched the Summer before,
do not come to mature Insects until the Spring following, as Mr. _Ray_
rightly observes in _Cat. Cantab._

As to the _Insects_ themselves, they are manifestly _Ichneumon-Flies_,
having four Wings, their _Alvus_ thick and large towards the Tail;
and tapering up till it is small and slender at its setting on to
the _Thorax_. But the _Alvi_ or Bellies are not alike in all, though
coloured alike. In some they are as is now described, and longer, without
_Terebræ_, or Tails; in some shorter with Tails: And in some yet shorter,
and thick, like the Belly of the _Ant_, or the Heart of Animals, as in
those before, _Note (z)._ But for a farther Description of them, I shall
refer to Mr. _Ray_, _Cat. Plant. circa Cantab._ under _Rosa Sylvest._

[hh] It being an Instance somewhat out of the Way, I shall pitch upon
it for an Example here, _viz._ The _gouty Swellings_ in the Body, and
the Branches of the _Blackberry-Bush_; of which _Malpighi_ hath given us
two good Cuts in Tab. 17. Fig. 62. The Cause of these is manifestly from
the Eggs of Insects laid in (whilst the Shoot is young and tender) as
far as the Pith, and in some Places not so deep; Which for the Reasons
before-mentioned, makes the young Shoots tumify, and grow knotty and
gouty.

The Insect that comes from hence is of the former Tribe, a small, shining
black _Ichneumon-Fly_, about a tenth of an Inch long; with jointed, red,
capillary Horns, four long Wings, reaching beyond the Body, a large
_Thorax_, red Legs, and a short, heart-like Belly. They hop like Fleas.
The Males are less than the Females; are very venereous, endeavouring
a _Coït_ in the very Box in which they are hatch’d; getting up on the
Females, and tickling and thumping them with their Breeches and Horns, to
excite them to Venery.




_The CONCLUSION._


And now these Things being seriously considered, what less can be
concluded, than that there is manifest Design and Forecast in this Case,
and that there must needs be some wise Artist, some careful, prudent
Conservator, that from the very Beginning of the Existence of this
Species of Animals, hath with great Dexterity and Forecast, provided for
its Preservation and Good? For what else could contrive and make such a
Set of curious Parts, exactly fitted up for that special Purpose: And
withal implant in the Body such peculiar Impregnations, as should have
such a strange uncouth Power on a quite different Rank of Creatures? And
lastly, what should make the Insect aware of this its strange Faculty and
Power, and teach it so cunningly and dextrously to employ it for its own
Service and Good?

CHAP. I.

_Of REPTILES._


Having dispatch’d the insect Tribe, there is but one _Genus_ of
the Land-Animals remaining to be survey’d; and that is, that of
_Reptiles_[a]. Which I shall dispatch in a little Compass, by Reason I
have somewhat amply treated of others, and many of the Things may be
apply’d here. But there are some Things in which this Tribe is somewhat
singular, which I shall therefore take Notice of briefly in this Place.
One is their Motion, which I have in another Place[b] taken Notice of to
be not less curious, than it is different from that of other Animals,
whether we consider the Manner of it, as vermicular, or sinuous[c], or
like that of the Snail[d], or the Caterpillar[e], or the Multipedous[f]
or any other Way, or the Parts ministring to it, particularly the
Spine[g], and the Muscles co-operating with the Spine, in such as have
Bone, and the annular and other Muscles, in such as have none, all
incomparably made for those curious, and I may say, geometrical Windings
and Turnings, Undulations, and all the various Motions to be met with in
the reptile Kind.

Another Thing that will deserve our Notice, is, the Poyson[h] that many
of this Tribe are stock’d with. Which I the rather mention, because some
make it an Objection against the divine Superintendence and Providence,
as being a Thing so far from useful, (they think,) that ’tis rather
mischievous and destructive of God’s Creatures. But the Answer is easy,
_viz._ That as to Man, those Creatures are not without their great Uses,
particularly in the Cure of[i] some of the most stubborn Diseases;
however, if they were not, there would be no Injustice for God to make
a Set of such noxious Creatures, as Rods and Scourges, to execute the
divine Chastisements upon ungrateful and sinful Men. And I am apt to
think that the Nations which know not God, are the most annoy’d with
those noxious Reptiles, and other pernicious Creatures. As to the Animals
themselves, their Poyson is no doubt of some great and especial Use to
themselves, serving to the more easy Conquest, and sure Capture of their
Prey, which might otherwise be too resty and strong, and if once escap’d,
would hardly be again recover’d, by Reason of their swifter Motion, and
the Help of their Legs; besides all which, this their Poyson may be
probably of very great Use to the Digestion of their Food.

And as to the innocuous Part of the Reptile-Kind, they as well deserve
our Notice for their Harmlesness, as the others did for their Poyson. For
as those are endow’d with Poyson, because they are predaceous; so these
need it not, because their Food is near at hand, and may be obtain’d
without Strife and Contest, the next Earth[k] affording Food to such as
can terebrate, and make Way into it by their Vermicular Faculty; and the
next Vegetable being Food to others that can climb and reach[l], or but
crawl to it.


FOOTNOTES:

[a] Notwithstanding I have before, in _Book IV. Chap. 12. Note (p)_,
taken Notice of the _Earth-Worm_; yet it being a good Example of the
Creator’s wise and curious Workmanship, in even this meanest Branch of
the Creation, I shall superadd a few farther Remarks from Drs. _Willis_
and _Tyson_. Saith _Willis_, _Lumbricus terrestris, licet vile &
contemptibile habetur, Organa vitalia, necnon & alia viscera, & membra
divino artificio admirabiliter fabrefacta sortitur: totius corporis
compages musculorum annularium catena est, quorum fibræ orbiculares
contractæ quemque annulum, prius amplum, & dilatum, angustiorem &
longiorem reddunt._ [This Muscle in Earth-Worms, I find is spiral, as
in a good Measure is their Motion likewise; _so that by this Means they
can, (like the Worm of an Augre,) the better bore their Passage into the
Earth. Their reptile Motion also, may be explain’d by a Wire wound on a
Cylinder, which when slipp’d off, and one End extended and held fast,
will bring the other nearer it. So the Earth-Worm, having shot out, or
extended its Body, (which is with a Wreathing,) it takes hold by those
small Feet it hath, and so contracts the hinder Part of its Body._ Thus
the curious and learned Dr. _Tyson_, Phil. Trans. Nᵒ. 147.] _Nam proinde
cùm portio corporis superior elongata, & exporrecta, ad spatium alterius
extenditur, ibidemque plano affigitur, ad ipsum quasi ad centrum portio
corporis inferior relaxata, & abbreviata facile pertrabitur. Pedunculi
serie quadruplici, per totam longitudinem Lumbrici disponuntur; his
quasi totidem uncis, partem modò hanc, modò istam, plano affigit, dum
alteram exporrigit, aut post se ducit. Supra oris hiatum, Proboscide, quâ
terram perforat & elevat, donatur._ And then he goes on with the other
Parts that fall under View, the _Brain_, the _Gullet_, the _Heart_, the
_spermatick Vessels_, the _Stomachs_ and _Intestines_, the _Foramina_
on the Top of the Back, adjoyning to each Ring, supplying the Place of
Lungs, and other Parts. _Willis de Anim. Brut._ P. 1. c. 3.

[b] In _Book IV. Chap. 8._

[c] There is a great Deal of geometrical Neatness and Nicety, in the
sinuous Motion of Snakes, and other Serpents. For the assisting in which
Action, the annular Scales under their Body are very remarkable, lying
cross the Belly, contrary to what those in the Back, and rest of the
Body do; also as the Edges of the foremost Scales lye over the Edges
of their following Scales, from Head to Tail; so those Edges run out
a little beyond, or over their following Scales; so as that when each
Scale is drawn back, or set a little upright by its Muscle, the outer
Edge thereof, (or Foot it may be call’d,) is rais’d also a little from
the Body, to lay hold on the Earth, and so promote and facilitate the
Serpent’s Motion. This is what may be easily seen in the Slough, or Belly
of the Serpent-kind. But there is another admirable Piece of Mechanism,
that my Antipathy to those Animals hath prevented my prying into; and
that is, that every Scale hath a distinct Muscle, one End of which is
tack’d to the Middle of its Scale; the other, to the upper Edge of its
following Scale. This Dr. _Tyson_ found in the _Rattle-Snake_, and I
doubt not is in the whole Tribe.

[d] The wise Author of Nature, having deny’d Feet and Claws to enable
Snails to creep and climb, hath made them amends in a Way more commodious
for their State of Life, by the broad Skin along each Side of the
Belly, and the undulating Motion observable there. By this latter ’tis
they creep; by the former, afflicted with the glutinous Slime emitted
from the Snail’s Body, they adhere firmly and securely to all Kinds of
Superficies, partly by the Tenacity of their Slime, and partly by the
Pressure of the Atmosphere. Concerning this Part, (which he calls the
_Snail’s Feet_,) and their Undulation, See Dr. _Lister_’s _Exercit.
Anat._ 1. §. 1. and 37.

[e] The motive Parts, and Motion of Caterpillars, are useful, not only
to their Progression and Conveyance from Place to Place; but also their
more certain, easy and commodious gathering of Food. For having Feet
before and behind, they are not only enabled to go by a kind of Steps
made by their fore and hind Parts; but also to climb up Vegetables, and
to reach from their Boughs and Stalks for Food at a Distance; for which
Services, their Feet are very nicely made both before and behind. Behind,
they have broad Palms for sticking too, and these beset almost round
with small sharp Nails, to hold and grasp what they are upon: Before,
their Feet are sharp and hook’d, to draw Leaves, _&c._ to them, and to
hold the fore-part of the Body, whilst the hinder-parts are brought up
thereto. But nothing is more remarkable in these Reptiles, than that
these Parts and Morton are only temporary, and incomparably adapted only
to their present _Nympha-State_; whereas in their _Aurelia-State_, they
have neither Feet nor Motion, only a little in their hinder parts: And in
their _Mature-State_, they have the Parts and Motion of a flying Insect,
made for Flight.

[f] It is a wonderful pretty Mechanism, observable in the going of
_Multipedes_, as the _Juli_, _Scolopendræ_, &c. that on each Side the
Body, every Leg hath its Motion, one very regularly following the other
from one End of the Body to the other in a Way not easy to be describ’d
in Words; so that their Legs in going, make a kind of Undulation, and
give the Body a swifter Progression than one would imagine it should
have, where so many Feet are to take so many short Steps.

_That which is most remarkable in the ~Vertebræ~ ~[of the _Rattle-Snake_,
besides the other curious Articulations,]~ is, that the round Ball in
the lower Part of the upper ~Vertebra~, enters a Socket of the upper
Part of the lower ~Vertebra~, like as the Head of the ~Os Femoris~ doth
the ~Acetabulum~ of the ~Os Ischii~; by which Contrivance, as also the
Articulation with one another, they have that free Motion of winding
their Bodies any Way._ Dr. _Tyson_’s Anat. of the _Rattle-Snake_ in
_Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 144. What is here observ’d of the _Vertebræ_ of this
_Snake_, is common to this whole _Genus_ of Reptiles.

[h] My ingenious and learned Friend, Dr. _Mead_, examined with his
Microscope, the Texture of a _Viper_’s _Poyson_, and found therein at
first only _a Parcel of small Salts nimbly floating in the Liquor; but
in a short Time the Appearance was chang’d, and these saline Particles
were shot out into Crystals, of an incredible Tenuity and Sharpness, with
something like Knots here and there, from which they seem’d to proceed;
so that the whole Texture did in a Manner represent a Spider’s Web,
though infinitely finer._ Mead of Poysons, p. 9.

As to the Nature and Operation of this _Poyson_, see the same ingenious
Author’s Hypothesis, in his following Pages.

This _Poyson_ of the _Viper_, lieth in a Bag in the Gums, at
the Upper-end of the Teeth. It is separated from the Blood by a
_conglomerated Gland_, lying in the anterior lateral Part of the _Os
Sincipitis_; just behind the Orbit of the Eye: From which Gland lieth a
Duct, that conveys the Poyson to the Bags at the Teeth.

The Teeth are tubulated, for the Conveyance, or Emission of the Poyson
into the Wound, the Teeth make; but their Hollowness doth not reach to
the _Apex_, or Top of the Tooth, (that being solid and sharp, the better
to pierce;) but it ends in a long slit below the Point, out of which the
Poyson is emitted. These Perforations of the Teeth, _Galen_ saith, the
Mountebanks us’d to stop with some kind of Paste, before they suffer’d
the Vipers to bite them before their Spectators. Cuts of these Parts,
_&c._ may be seen in the last cited Book of Dr. _Mead_. Also Dr. _Tyson’s
Anat. of the Rattle-Snake_, in _Philos. Transact._ Nᵒ. 144.

[i] That Vipers have their great Uses in Physick, is manifest from their
bearing a great Share in some of our best Antidotes, such as _Theriaca
Andromachi_, and others; also in the Cure of the _Elephantiasis_, and
others the like stubborn Maladies, for which I shall refer to the medical
Writers. But there is so singular a Case in the curious Collection of Dr.
_Ol. Worm._ related from _Kircher_, that I shall entertain the Reader
with it. Near the Village of _Sassa_, about eight Miles from the City
_Bracciano_ in _Italy_, saith he, _Specus feu caverna (vulgò La Grotta
delli Serpi) duorum hominum capax, fistulosis quibusdam foraminibus in
formam cribri perforata cernitur, ex quibus ingens quædam, principio
veris, diversicolorum Serpentum, nullâ tamen, ut dicitur, singulari
veneni qualitate imbutorum progenies quotannis pullulare solet. In hæc
speluncâ Elephantiacos, Leprosos, Paralyticos, Arabriticos, Podagricos,
~&c.~ nudos exponere solent, qui mox halituum subterraneorum calore
in sudorem resoluti, Serpentum propullulantium, totum corpus infirmi
implicantium, suctu linctuque ita omni vitioso virulentoque humore
privare dicuntur, ut repetito hoc per aliquod tempus medicamento, tandem
perfecta sanitati restituantur._ This Cave _Kircher_ visited himself,
found it warm, and every Way agreeable to the Description he had of it;
he saw their Holes, heard a murmuring hissing Noise in them; but although
he missed seeing the Serpents (it being not the Season of their creeping
out) yet he saw great Numbers of their _Exuviæ_, or _Sloughs_, and an Elm
growing hard by laden with them.

The Discovery of this Cave, was by the Cure of a _Leper_ going from
_Rome_ to some Baths near this Place; who losing his Way, and being
benighted, happened upon this Cave; and finding it very warm, pull’d off
his Cloaths, and being weary and sleepy, had the good Fortune not to feel
the Serpents about him, till they had wrought his Cure. _Vid._ _Museum
Worm._ L. 3. c. 9.

The before-commended Dr. _Mead_, thinks our Physicians deal too
cautiously and sparingly, in their prescribing only small Quantities
of the Viper’s Flesh, _&c._ in the _Elephantiasis_, and stubborn
_Leprosies_: But he recommendeth rather the Gelly or Broth of Vipers; or,
as the ancient Manner was, to boil Vipers, and eat them like Fish; or at
least to drink Wine, in which they have been long infused. _Vid._ _Mead.
ubi supr._ p. 34.

[k] That _Earth-worms_ live upon Earth, is manifest from the little
curled Heaps of their Dung ejected out of their Holes. But in _Philos.
Transact._ Nᵒ. 291, I have said, it is in all Probability Earth made of
rotted Roots and Plants, and such like nutritive Things, not pure Earth.
And there is farther Reason for it, because Worms will drag the Leaves of
Trees into their Holes.

[l] _Snails_ might be in Danger of wanting Food, if they were to live
only upon such tender Plants as are near the Ground, within their Reach
only; to impower them therefore to extend their Pursuits farther, they
are enabled by the Means mentioned in _Note (d)_, to stick unto, and
creep up Walls and Vegetables at their Pleasure.




CHAP. II.

_Of the Inhabitants of the WATERS._


I have now gone through that Part of the Animal World, which I proposed
to survey, the Animals inhabiting the Land.

As to the other Part of the Terraqueous Globe, the Waters, and the
Inhabitants thereof, not having Time to finish what I have begun, on
that large Subject, I shall be forced to quit it for the present, altho’
we have there as ample and glorious a Scene of the Infinite Creator’s
Power and Art, as hath been already set forth on the dry Land. For the
Waters themselves are an admirable Work of God[a], and of infinite
Use[b] to that Part of the Globe already surveyed; and the prodigious
Variety[c], and Multitudes of curious and wonderful Things observable in
its Inhabitants of all Sorts, are an inexhaustible Scene of the Creator’s
Wisdom and Power. The vast Bulk of some[d], and prodigious Minuteness of
others[e], together with the incomparable Contrivance and Structure of
the Bodies[f] of all; the Provisions and Supplies of Food afforded to
such an innumerable Company of Eaters, and that in an Element, unlikely
one would think, to afford any great Store of Supplies[g]; the Business
of Respiration perform’d in a Way so different from, but equivalent to
what is in Land Animals[h]; the Adjustment of the Organs of Vision[i] to
that Element in which the Animal liveth; the Poise[k], the Support[l],
the Motion of the Body[m], forwards with great Swiftness, and upwards
and downwards with great Readiness and Agility, and all without Feet and
Hands, and ten thousand Things besides; all these Things, I say, do lay
before us so various, so glorious, and withal so inexhaustible a Scene of
the divine Power, Wisdom and Goodness, that it would be in vain to engage
my self in so large a Province, without allotting as much Time and Pains
to it, as the preceding Survey hath cost me. Passing by therefore that
Part of our Globe, I shall only say somewhat very briefly concerning the
_insensitive_ Creatures, particularly those of the _vegetable Kingdom_,
and so conclude this Survey.

[Illustration]


FOOTNOTES:

[a] Besides their absolute Necessity, and great Use to the World, there
are several Topics, from whence the Waters may be demonstrated to be
God’s Work; as, the creating so vast a Part of our Globe; the placing it
commodiously therein, and giving it Bounds; the Methods keeping it sweet
and clean, by its Saltness, by the Tides, and Agitations by the Winds;
the making the Waters useful to the Vegetation of Plants, and for Food to
Animals, by the noble Methods of sweetning them; and many other Things
besides, which are insisted on in that Part of my Survey.

[b] _Pliny_ having named divers _Mirabilia Aquarum_, to shew their Power;
then proceeds to their Uses, viz. _Eædem cadentes omnium terrâ nascentium
causa fiunt, prorsus mirabili naturâ, siquis velit reputare, ut fruges
gignantur, arbores fruticesque vivant, in cœlum migrare aquas, animamque
etiam herbis vitalem inde deferre: justâ confessione, omnes terra quoque
vires aquarum esse beneficii. Quapropter ante omnia ipsarum potentia
exempla ponemus: Cunctas enim quis mortalium enamerare queat?_ And then
he goes on with an Enumeration of some Waters famed for being medicinal,
or some other unusual Quality. _Plin._ L. 31. c. 1. & 2.

[c] _Pliny_ reckons 176 Kinds in the Waters, whose Names may be met with
in his L. 32. c. 11. but he is short in his Account.

[d] _Pliny_, L. 9. c. 3. saith, that in the _Indian_ Sea there are
_Balenæ quaternûm jugerum_ (i.e. 960 Feet) _Pristes 200 cubitorum_ (i.e.
300 Feet.) And L. 32. c. 1. he mentions _Whales_ 600 Foot long, and 360
broad, that came into a River of _Arabia_. If the Reader hath a mind, he
may see his Reason why the largest Animals are bred in the Sea, L. 9. c.
2.

[e] As the largest, so the most minute Animals are bred in the Waters, as
those in Pepper-water; and such as make the green Scum on the Waters, or
make them seem as if green, and many others. See _Book IV. Chap. 11. Note
(n), (v)._

[f] It might be here shewn, that the Bodies of all the several
Inhabitants of the Waters are the best contrived and suited to that Place
and Business in the Waters, which is proper for them; that particularly
their Bodies are cloathed and guarded, in the best Manner, with Scales,
or Shells, _&c._ suitable to the Place they are to reside in, the Dangers
they may there be exposed unto, and the Motion and Business they are
there to perform: That the Center of Gravity (of great Consideration in
that fluid Element,) is always plac’d in the fittest Part of the Body:
That the Shape of their Bodies, (especially the more swift,) is the
most commodious for making Way through the Water, and most agreeable to
geometrical Rules; and many other Matters besides would deserve a Place
here, were they not too long for Notes, and that I shall anticipate what
will be more proper for another Place, and more accurately treated of
there.

[g] See before _Book IV. Chap. 11._

[h] _Galen_ was aware of the Respiration of Fishes by their _Branchiæ_.
For having said, that Fishes have no Occasion of a Voice, neither
respire through the Mouth as Land Animals do, he saith, _Sed earum, quas
Branchias nuncupamus, constructio, ipsis vice Pulmonis est. Cùm enim
crebris ac tenuibus foraminibus sint Branchiæ hæ interceptæ, aëri quidem
& vapori perviis, subtilioribus tamen quàm pro mole aquæ; hanc quidem
extra repellunt, illa autem promptè intromittunt._ Galen de Us. Part.
L. 6. c. 9. So also _Pliny_ held, that Fishes respired by their Gills;
but he saith _Aristotle_ was of a different Opinion. _Plin._ L. 9. c. 7.
And so _Aristotle_ seems to be in his _Hist. Animal._ L. 8. c. 2. and in
other Places. And I may add our famous Dr. _Needham_. See his _De form.
Fœtu_, Chap. 6. and _Answer to ~Severinus~_.

[i] A protuberant Eye would have been inconvenient for Fishes, by
hindring their Motion in so dense a Medium as Water is; or else their
brushing through so thick a Medium would have been apt to wear, and
prejudice their Eyes; therefore their _Cornea_ is flat. To make amends
for which, as also for the Refraction of Water, different from that of
the Air, the wise Contriver of the Eye, hath made the _Crystalline_
spherical in Fishes, which in Animals, living in the Air, is
_lenticular_, and more flat.

[k] As I have shew’d before, that the Bodies of Birds are nicely pois’d
to swim in the Air; so are those of Fishes for the Water, every Part
of the Body being duly balanc’d, and the Center of Gravity, (as I said
in _Note (f)_), accurately fix’d. And to prevent Vacillation, some of
the Fins serve, particularly those of the Belly; as _Borelli_ prov’d by
cutting off the Belly-fins, which caus’d the Fish to reel to the right
and left Hand, and render’d it unable to stand steadily in an upright
Posture.

[l] To enable the Fish to abide at the Top, or Bottom, or any other Part
of the Waters, the Air-Bladder is given to most Fishes, which as ’tis
more full or empty, makes the Body more or less buoyant.

[m] The _Tail_ is the grand Instrument of the Motion of the Body; not the
Fins, as some imagine. For which Reason, Fishes are more musculous and
strong in that Part, than in all the rest of their Body, according as it
is in the motive Parts of all Animals, in the pectoral Muscles of Birds,
the Thighs of Man, _&c._

If the Reader hath a Mind to see the admirable Method, how Fishes row
themselves by their Tail, and other Curiosities relating to their
Swimming; I shall refer him to _Borelli_ _de mot. Anim._ Part. 1. Chap.
23. particularly to Prop. 213.

BOOK X.

_Of VEGETABLES._


The Vegetable Kingdom, although an inferiour Branch of the Creation,
exhibits to us such an ample Scene of the Creator’s Contrivance,
Curiosity, and Art, that I much rather chuse to shew what might be
said, than engage too far in Particulars. I might insist upon the great
Variety there is, both of Trees and Plants provided for all Ages, and
for every Use and Occasion of the World[a]; some for Building, for Tools
and Utensils of every Kind; some hard, some soft; some tough and strong,
some brittle; some long and tall, some short and low; some thick and
large, some small and tender; some for Physick[b], some for Food, some
for Pleasure; yea, the most abject[c] Shrubs, and the very Bushes and
Brambles themselves, the Husbandman can testify the Use of.

I might also survey here the curious Anatomy and Structure of their
Bodies[d], and shew the admirable Provision made for the Conveyance
of the lymphatick and essential Juices, for communicating the Air, as
necessary to Vegetable, as Animal Life[e]: I might also speak of, even
the very Covering they are provided with, because it is a curious Work
in Reality, although less so in Appearance: And much more therefore
might I survey the neat Variety and Texture of their Leaves[f], the
admirable Finery, Gaiety, and Fragrancy of their Flowers[g]. I might
also inquire into the wonderful Generation and Make of the Seed[h], and
the great Usefulness of their Fruit: I might shew that the Rudiments and
Lineaments of the Parent-Vegetable, though never so large and spacious,
is locked up in the little Compass of their Fruit or Seed, though some
of those Seeds are scarce visible to the naked Eye[i]. And forasmuch as
the Perpetuity and Safety of the Species depends upon the Safety of the
Seed and Fruit in a great measure, I might therefore take notice of the
peculiar Care the great God of Nature hath taken for the Conservation and
Safety hereof: As particularly in such as dare to shew their Heads all
the Year, how securely their Flower, Seed or Fruit is locked up all the
Winter, together with their Leaves and Branches, in their Gems[k] and
well fenced and covered there with neat and close Tunicks. And for such
as dare not so to expose themselves, with what Safety are they preserved
under the Coverture of the Earth, in their Root [l], Seed [m], or Fruit,
till invited out by the kindly Warmth of the Spring! And when the whole
Vegetable Race is thus called out, it is very pretty to observe the
Methods of Nature in guarding those insensitive Creatures against Harms
and Inconveniencies, by making some (for Instance) to lie down prostrate,
and others, to close themselves up [n] upon the Touch of Animals, and
the most to shut up their Flowers, their Down [o], or other their like
Guard, upon the Close and Cool of the Evening, by Means of Rain, or other
Matters that may be prejudicial to the tender Seed.

And now to these Considerations relating to the Seed, I might add the
various Ways of Nature in dissipating and sowing it, some being for this
end, winged with light Down, or Wings, to be conveyed about by the Winds;
others being laid in elastick, springy Cases, that when they burst and
crack, dart their Seed at convenient Distances, performing thereby the
Part of a good Husbandman[p]; others by their agreeable Taste and Smell,
and salutary Nature, inviting themselves to be swallow’d, and carry’d
about by the Birds, and thereby also fertiliz’d by passing through their
Bodies[q]; and others not thus taken Care of, do many of them by their
Usefulness in human Life, invite the Husbandman and Gardiner carefully to
sow and nurse them up.

To this so singular a Care about the Propagation and Conservation of
the Species of Vegetables, I might add the nice Provision that is made
for their Support and Aid, in standing and growing, that they may keep
their Heads above Ground, and not be rotted and spoil’d in the Earth
themselves, nor thereby annoy us; but on the contrary, minister to
all their Ends, and our Uses; to afford us Houses, Utensils, Food[r],
Physick, Cloathing, yea, Diversion too, by the Beauty of their Looks, by
the Fragrancy of their Smell, by creating us pleasant Shades against the
scorching Beams of Summer, and skreening us against the piercing Winds,
and Cold of Winter[s].

And it is very observable what admirable Provisions are made for this
Purpose of their Support and Standing, both in such as stand by their
own Strength, and such as need the Help of others. In such as stand by
their own Strength, it is, by Means of the stronger and more ligneous
Parts, (equivalent to the Bones in Animals,) being made not inflexible,
as Bones; because they would then be apt to break; but of a yielding
elastick Nature, to escape and dodge the Violence of the Winds; and by
Means also of the Branches spreading handsomely and commodiously about,
at an Angle of about 45 gr. by which Means they equally fill up, and at
the same Time make an Æquilibration of the Top[t].

And as for such Vegetables as are weak, and not able to support
themselves, ’tis a wonderful Faculty they have, so readily and naturally
to make Use of the Help of their Neighbours, embracing and climbing up
upon them[u], and using them as Crutches to their feeble Bodies: Some
by their odd convolving Faculty, by twisting themselves like a Screw
about others; some advancing themselves, by catching and holding with
their curious _Claspers_ and _Tendrels_, equivalent to the Hands; some
by striking in their rooty Feet; and others by the Emission of a natural
Glue, closely and firmly adhering to something or other that administers
sufficient Support unto them. All which various Methods being so nicely
accommodated to the Indigencies of those helpless Vegetables, and not to
be met with in any besides, is a manifest Indication of their being the
Contrivance and Work of the Creator, and that his infinite Wisdom and
Care condescends, even to the Service, and well-being of the meanest,
most weak, and helpless insensitive Parts of the Creation.

In the last Place, to the Uses already hinted at, I might add a large
Catalogue of such among Vegetables, as are of peculiar Use and Service
to the World, and seem to be design’d as ’twere on Purpose, by the most
merciful Creator, for the Good of Man, or other Creatures[w]. Among
_Grain_, I might name the great Fertility[x] of such as serves for Bread,
the easy Culture and Propagation thereof, and the Agreement of every
Soil and Climate to it. Among Trees, and Plants, I might instance in
some that seem to be design’d, as ’twere on Purpose, for almost every
Life[y], and Convenience; some to heal the most stubborn and dangerous
Distempers[z], to alleviate and ease the Pains[aa] of our poor infirm
Bodies, all the World over: And some designed for the peculiar Service
and Good of particular Places, either to cure such Distempers as are
peculiar to them, by growing more plentifully there than elsewhere[bb];
or else to obviate some Inconvenience there, or to supply some constant
Necessity, or Occasion, not possible, or at least not easy, to be
supplied any other Way[cc]. ’Tis, for Instance, an admirable Provision
made for some Countries subject to Drought, that when the Waters every
where fail, there are Vegetables which contain not only Moisture enough
to supply their own Vegetation and Wants, but afford Drink also both to
Man and other Creatures, in their great Extremities[dd]; and a great
deal more might be instanced in of a like Nature, and Things that bear
such plain Impresses of the Divine Wisdom and Care, that they manifest
the Super-intendence of the infinite Creator.

Thus I have given a Sketch of another Branch of the Creation, which
(although one of the meanest, yet) if it was accurately viewed, would
abundantly manifest it self to be the Work of God. But because I have
been so long upon the other Parts, although less than they deserve, I
must therefore content my self with those general Hints I have given;
which may however serve as Specimens of what might have been more largely
said about this inferiour Part of the animated Creation.

As to the _Inanimate Part_, such as Stones, Minerals, Earths, and
such-like, that which I have already said in the Beginning shall suffice.

[d] Dr. _Beal_ (who was very curious, and tried many Experiments upon
Vegetables) gives some good Reasons to imagine, that there is a direct
Communication between the Parts of the Tree and the Fruit, so that the
same Fibres which constitute the Root, Trunk, and Boughs, are extended
into the very Fruit. And in old _Horn-beams_, I have observed something
very like this; in many of which, there are divers great and small Ribs
(almost like Ivy, only united to the Body) running from the Root up along
the outside of the Body, and terminating in one single, or a few Boughs:
Which Bough or Boughs spread again into Branches, Leaves and Fruit. See
what Dr. _Beal_ hath in _Lowth. Abr._ V. 2. p. 710.

But as to the particular Canals, and other Parts relating to the Anatomy
of Vegetables, it is too long a Subject for this Place, and therefore I
shall refer to _Seigneur Malpighi_’s and Dr. _Grew_’s Labours in this
kind.

[e] _Tanta est Respirationis necessitas, & usus, ut Natura in singulis
viventium ordinibus varia, sed analoga, paraverit instrumenta, quæ
Pulmones vocamus_ [and so he goes on with observing the _Apparatus_ made
in the various _Genera_ of Animals, and then saith] _In Plantis verò,
quæ infirmum animalium attingunt ordinem, tantam Trachearum copiam &
productionem extare par est, ut his minimæ Vegetantium partes præter
corticem irrigentur.——Plantæ igitur (ut conjectari fas est) cum sint
viventia, visceribus infixa terræ, ab hac, seu potius ab aquâ & aëre,
commixtis & percolatis à terrâ, Respirationis suæ materiam recipiunt,
ipsarumque Tracheæ ab halitu terræ, extremas radices subingresso,
replentur._ Malpig. Op. Anat. Plant. p. 15.

These _Tracheæ_ or _Air-Vessels_, are visible, and appear very pretty
in the Leaf of _Scabious_, or the Vine, by pulling asunder some of its
principal Ribs, or great Fibres; between which, may be seen the Spiral
_Air-Vessels_ (like Threads of Cob-web) a little uncoyled: A Figure
whereof, Dr. _Grew_ hath given us in his _Anat. Plant._ Tab. 51. 52.

As to the curious coyling, and other Things relating to the Structure
of those _Air-Vessels_. I refer to _Malpig._ p. 14. and Dr. _Grew_, ib.
L. 3. c. 3. §. 16 _&c._ and L. 4. c. 4. §. 19. of Mr. _Ray_, from them
succinctly, _Hist. Plant._ L. 1. c. 4.

[f] Concerning the _Leaves_, I shall note only two or three Things. 1. As
to the _Fibres of the Leaf_, they stand not in the _Stalk_, in an even
Line, but always in an Angular, or Circular Posture, and their vascular
Fibres or Threads, are 3, 5, or 7. The Reason of their Position thus,
is for the more erect Growth and greater Strength of the Leaf, as also
for the Security of its Sap. Of all which see, Dr. _Grew_, L. 1. c. 4.
§. 8. _&c._ and L. 4. Par. 1. c. 3. also Tab. 4. Fig. 2. to 11. Another
Observable in the Fibres of the Leaf, is their orderly Position, so as to
take in an eighth Part of a Circle, as in _Mallows_; in some a tenth, but
in most a twelfth, as in _Holy-Oak_; or a sixth, as in _Sirynga_. Id. ib.
Tab. 46, 47.

2. The Art in _Folding up the Leaves_ before their Eruption out of their
Gems, _&c._ is incomparable, both for its Elegancy and Security, _viz._
_In taking up (so as their Forms will bear) the least room; and in being
so conveniently couched as to be capable of receiving Protection from
other Parts, or of giving it to one another, ~e.g.~ First, there is
the Bow-lap, where the Leaves are all laid somewhat convexly one over
another, but not plaited——but where the Leaves are not so thick set, as
to stand in the Bow-lap, there we have the Plicature, or the Flat-lap;
as in Rose-tree, ~&c.~_ And so that curious Observer goes on shewing
the various Foldings, to which he gives the Names of the _Duplicature_,
_Multiplicature_, the _Fore-rowl_, _Back-rowl_, and _Tre-rowl_, or
_Treble-rowl_. Grew. ib. L. 1. c. 4. §. 14, _&c._ To these he adds some
others, L. 4. P. 1. c. 1. §. 9. Consult also _Malpig. de Gemmis_, p. 22.
&c.

To these curious Foldings, we may add another noble Guard by the
Interposition of _Films_, _&c._ of which Dr. _Grew_ saith, there are
about six Ways, _viz._ _Leaves_, _Surfoyls_, _Ingerfoyls_, _Stalks_,
_Hoods_, and _Mantlings_. Grew. ib. and Tab. 41, 42. Malpig. ibid.

[g] In the _Flower_ may be considered the _Empalement_, as Dr. _Grew_;
the _Calix_, or _Perianthium_, as Mr. _Ray_ and others, call it, designed
to be a Security, and Bands, to the other Parts of the Flower. _Floris
velut basis & fulcimentum est._ Ray Hist. L. 1. c. 10. Flowers, whose
_Petala_ are strong (as Tulips) have no _Calix_. _Carnations_, whose
_Petala_ are long and slender, have an Empalement of one Piece: And
others, such as the _Knap-weeds_, have it consisting of several Pieces,
and in divers Rounds, and all with a counterchangeable Respect to each
other, for the greater Strength and Security of themselves, and the
_Petala_, &c. they include.

The next is the _Foliation_, as Dr. _Grew_, the _Petala_, or _Folia_,
as Mr. _Ray_, and others. In these, not only the admirable Beauty, and
luxuriant Colours are observable, but also their curious _Foldings_ in
the _Calix_, before their Expansion. Of which Dr. _Grew_ hath these
Varieties, _viz._ The _Close-Couch_, as in _Roses_; the _Concave-Couch_,
as in _Blattaria flore albo_; the _Single-Plait_, as in _Pease-Blossoms_;
the _Double-Plait_, as in _Blue-Bottles_, &c. the _Couch_ and _Plait_
together, as in _Marigolds_, &c. the _Rowl_, as in _Ladies Bower_; the
_Spire_, as in _Mallows_; and lastly, the _Plait_ and _Spire_ together,
as in _Convolvulus Doronici folio_. L. 1. c. 5. §. 6. and Tab. 54.

As to the _Stamina_ with their _Apices_, and the _Stylus_, (called the
_Attire_ by Dr. _Grew_) they are admirable, whether we consider their
Colours, or their Make, especially their Use, if it be as Dr. _Grew_,
Mr. _Ray_, and others imagine, namely, as a _Male Sperm_, to impregnate
and fructify the Seed. Which Opinion is corroborated by the ingenious
Observations of Mr. _Sam. Morland_, in _Philos. Trans._ Nᵒ. 287.

_Reliqua usus alimentique gratiâ genuit ~[Natura]~ ideoque secula
annosque tribuit iis. Flores verò odoresque in diem gignit: magnâ (ut
palam est) admonitione hominum, quæ spectatissimè floreant, celerrimè
marcescere._ Plin. N. H. L. 21. c. 1.

[h] As to the curious and gradual Process of Nature in the Formation of
the Seed or Fruit of Vegetables, Cuts being necessary, I shall refer to
Dr. _Grew_, p. 45, and 209, and _Malpig._ p. 57.

[i] _Vetus est Empedoclis dogma, Plantarum semina Ova esse, ab iisdem
decidua——Inest in eo ~[Ovo vel Semine]~ velut in cicatrice, non sola
viventis carina, sed cum minimo trunco assurgentes partes, Gemma
scilicet, & insignis radicis Conus, ~&c.~_ Malpig. ib. p. 81. vid. plura
in tract. _de Seminum veget._ p. 14. & passim.

In _Malpighi_’s Life, a Debate may be seen between him and _Seign.
Triumphetti_, the Provost of the Garden at _Rome_, whether the whole
Plant be actually in the Seed. The Affirmative is maintained by
_Malpighi_, with cogent Arguments; among which, this is one; _Non
præoccupatâ mente, oculis microscopio armatis, lustret quæso Phaseolorum,
seminalem plantulam nondum satam, in quâ folia stabilia, hæcque ampla
evidenter observabit; in eâdem pariter gemmam, nodos, seu implantationes
varias foliorum caulis deprehendet. Caulem insignem fibris ligneis, &
utriculorum seriebus constantem conspicuè attinget._ And whereas _S.
Triumphetti_ had objected, that _vegetatione, metamorphosi, inediâ
plantas in alias degenerare, ut exemplo plurium ~[constat]~ præcipuè
tritici in lolium, & lolii in triticum versi._ In answer to this, (which
is one of the strongest Arguments against _Malpighi_’s Assertion)
_Malpighi_ replies, _Nondum certum est de integritate, & successu
experimenti, nam facienti mihi, & amicis, tritici metamorphosis non
cessit. Admissa tamen metamorphosi, quoniam hæc neglecta cultura, aut
vitio soli, aut aëris contingit——ideo ex morboso & monstruoso affectu
non licet inferre permanentem statum à Naturâ intentum. Observo plantas
sylvestres culturâ varias reddi, ~&c.~_ I have more largely taken notice
of _Malpighi_’s Answer, because he therein shews his Opinion about the
Transmutation of Vegetables. _Vid._ _Malpig. Vit._ p. 67.

So Mr. _Lewenhoeck_, after his nice Observations of an _Orange-Kernel_,
which he made to germinate in his Pocket, _&c._ concludes, _Thus we see,
how small a Particle, no bigger than a course Sand ~(as the Plant is
represented)~ is increased, ~&c.~ A plain Demonstration, that the Plant,
and all belonging to it, was actually in the Seed, in the young Plant,
its Body, Root, ~&c.~_ Philos. Trans. Nᵒ. 287. See also _Raii Cat. Cant._
in _Acer maj._ from Dr. _Highmore_. But in all the Seeds which I have
viewed, except the _Maple_, the Plant appears the plainest to the naked
Eye, and also very elegant, in the _Nux Vomica_. _Natura non observat
magnitudinis proportionem inter semina & plantas ab iisdem ortas, ita ut
majus semen majorem semper producat plantam, minus minorem. Sunt enim in
genere herbarum non pauca, quarum semina arborum nonnullarum seminibus
non dico æqualia sunt, sed multo majora. Sic ~v.g.~ Semina Fabæ, ~&c.~
semina Ulmi, ~&c.~ multis vicibus magnitudine superant._ Raii ubi suprà,
L. 1. c. 13.

_Filicem reliquasque Capillares herbas Semine carere Veteres
plerique——prodidere; quos etiam secuti sunt è Recentioribus nonnulli,
Dodonæus, ~&c.~——Alii è contrà, Bauhinus, ~&c.~ Filices & congeneres
spermatophoras esse contendunt: Partim quia Historia Creationis_, Genes.
ii. 12. &c.——_Hanc sententiam verissimam esse——autopsia convincit._
_Fredericus Cæsius_, he saith, was the first that discovered these Seeds
with the Help of a Microscope. And since him, Mr. _W. C._ hath more
critically observed them. Among other Things observed by that ingenious
Gent. are these, _Pixidulæ seu capsulæ semina continentes in plerisque
hoc genus plantis perquam exili granulo arenæ vulgaris cinereæ plus
duplo minores sunt; imò in nonnullis speciebus vix tertiam quartamve
arenulæ partem magnitudine æquant, vesicularum quarundam annulis aut
fasciolis vermiformibus obvolutarum speciem exhibentes. Nonnulle ex his
vesiculis 100 circiter semina continere deprehendebantur.——adeò eximiâ
parvitate ut nudo oculo prorsus essent invisibilia, nec nisi microscopii
interventu detegi possent.——Osmunda Regalis, quæ aliis omnibus Filicis
speciebus mole——antecellit——vascula seminalia obtinet æquè cum reliquis
congeneribus magnitudinis——quorum immensa & visum fugiens parvitas cum
magnitudine plantæ collata——adeò nullam gerere proportionem invenietur,
ut tantam plantam è tantillo semine produci attentum observatarem meritò
in admirationem rapiat._ Ray, ibid. L. 3. pag. 132. This _W. C._ was Mr.
_Wil. Cole_, as he owneth in a Letter I have now in my Hands of his to
Mr. _Ray_, of _Octob. 18, 1684._

[k] _Vegetantium genus, ut debitam magnitudinem sortiatur, & suæ
mortalitatis jacturam sucessivâ prolis eductione reparet, statis
temporibus novas promit partes, ut tandem emergentes Uteri, recentes
edant Soboles. Emanantes igitur a caule, caudice, ramis, & radicibus
novellæ hujusmodi partes, non illico laxatæ extenduntur, sed compendio
quodam coagmentatæ intra folii axillam cubantes, non parum subsistunst,
Gemmæ appellantur, ~&c.~_ And then that great Man goes on to shew the
admirable various Methods of Nature, in repositing in that little
Compass, so large a Part of a Tree or Plant, the curious Structure of the
Gems, the admirable Guard afforded them, and the Leaves, Flowers and Seed
contained in them, _&c._ Of which having taken Notice before, I pass over
it now, and only refer to our Author _Malpighi_, and Dr. _Grew_, in the
Places cited in _Note (f) and (g)._

[l] Of _Bulbous_, and a great many more, probably of the far greater
Number of _Perennial Roots_ of Herbs, as _Arum_, _Rape-Crowfoot_, &c. it
is very observable, that their Root is annually renewed, or repaired out
of the Trunk or Stalk it self. That is to say, the _Basis_ of the _Stalk_
continually, and by insensible Degrees descending below the Surface of
the Earth, and hiding it self therein, is thus both in Nature, Place
and Office, changed into a true Root.——So in _Brownwort_, the Basis of
the Stalk sinking down by Degrees, till it lies under Ground, becomes
the upper Part of the Root; and continuing still to sink, the next
Year becomes the lower Part: And the next after that, rots away; a new
Addition being still yearly made out of the Stalk, as the elder Parts
yearly rot away. _Grew._ _ibid._ L. 2. pag. 59. _ubi plura vid._

[m] How safe and agreeable a Conservatory the Earth is to Vegetables,
more than any other, is manifest from their rotting, drying, or being
rendred infecund in the Waters, or the Air; but in the Earth their
Vigour is long preserved. Thus Seeds particularly, Mr. _Ray_ thinks
some, may probably retain their Fecundity for ten Years, and others lose
it in five; but, saith he, _In terræ gremio latitantia, quamvis tot
caloris, frigoris, humoris & siccitatis varietatibus ibidem obnoxia,
diutiùs tamen (ut puto) fertilitatem suam tuentur quàm ab hominibus
diligentissimè custodita; nam & ego & alii ante me multi observârunt
Sinapeos vim magnam enatam in aggeribus fossarum recèns factis inque
areis gramineis effossis, ubi post hominum memoriam nulla unquam Sinapeos
seges succreverat. Quam tamen non spontè ortam suspicor, sed è seminibus
in terra per tot annos resuduis etiam prolificis._ Ray. Hist. Pl. L. 1.
C. 13.

[n] _Plantæ nonnullæ Æschynomenæ Veteribus dictæ, Recentioribus Vivæ, &
Sensitivæ, & Mimosæ, haud obscura sensus indicia produnt; siquidem folia
earnum manu aut baculo tacta, & paululum compressa, pleno etiam meridie,
splendente Sole, illico se contrahunt; in nonnullis etiam speciebus
cauliculi teneriores concidunt & velut marcescunt; quod idem ab aëre
frigidiore admissa patiuntur._ Ray. Hist. Pl. T. 1. L. 18. App. S. 2. c.
2. p. 978.

[o] I have observed that many, if not most Vegetables, do expand their
Flowers, Down, _&c._ in warm, Sun-shiny Weather, and again close them
towards Evening, or in Rain, _&c._ especially at the Beginning of
Flowering, when the Seed is young and tender; as is manifest in the
Down of _Dandelion_, and other Downs; and eminently in the Flowers of
_Pimpernel_; the opening and shutting of which, are the Country-Man’s
Weather-wiser; whereby _Gerard_ saith, he foretelleth what Weather shall
follow the next Day; for saith he, _if the Flowers be close shut up, it
betokeneth Rain and foul Weather; contrarywise, if they be spread abroad,
fair Weather._ Ger. Herb. B. 2. c. 183.

_Est & alia ~[arbor in Tylis]~ similis, foliosior tamen, roseique floris;
quem noctu comprimens, aperire incipit Solis exortu, meridie expandit.
Incolæ dormiræ eam dicunt._ Plin. Nat. Hist. L. 12. c. 11.

[p] _So soon as the Seed is ripe, Nature taketh several Methods for
its being duly Sown; not only in the opening of the ~Uterus~, but also
in the make of the Seed it self. For, First, The Seeds of many Plants,
which affect a peculiar Soil or Seat, as of ~Arum~, ~Poppy~, ~&c.~ are
heavy and small enough, without further Care, to fall directly down into
the Ground——But if they are so large and light, as to be expos’d to the
Wind, they are often furnish’d with one or more Hooks, to stay them from
straying too far from their proper Place——So the Seeds of ~Avens~ have
one single Hook; those of ~Agrimony~ and ~Goose-grass~, many; both the
former loving a warm Bank; the latter, an Hedge for its Support. On the
contrary, many Seeds are furnish’d with Wings or Feathers; partly with
the Help of the Wind to carry them, when ripe, from off the Plant, as
of ~Ash~, ~&c.~——and partly to enable them to make their Flight more
or less abroad, that so they may not, by falling together, come up too
thick; and that if one should miss a good Soil or Bed, another may hit.
So the Kernels of ~Pine~ have Wings——yet short——whereby they fly not
into the Air, but only flutter upon the Ground. But those of ~Typha~,
~Dandelion~, and most of the pappous Kind——have long numerous Feathers,
by which they are wafted every Way.——Again, there are Seeds which are
scatter’d not by flying abroad, but by being either spirted or flung
away. The first of those are Wood sorrel, which having a running Root,
Nature sees fit to sow the Seeds at some Distance. The doing of which is
effected by a white sturdy Cover, of a tendinous or springy Nature.——This
Cover, so soon as it begins to dry, bursts open on one Side, in an
instant, and is violently turn’d Inside outward——and so smartly throws
off the Seed. The Seeds of ~Hart’s-tongue~, is flung or shot away——by
the curious Contrivance of the Seed-case, as in ~Codded-Asmart~, only
there the spring moves and curls inward, but here outward, ~viz.~ Every
Seed-case——is of a spherick Figure, and girded about with a Sturdy
Spring.——The Surface of the Spring resembles a fine Screw.——So soon
as——this Spring is become stark enough, it suddenly breaks the Case into
two Halfs, like two little Cups, and so flings the Seed._ Grew. ib.
p. 199. and in Tab. 72. all these admirable Artifices are handsomely
represented.

_Quin si quantitas modica seminum ~(Filicis Phyiltitidis quoque)~ à
foliis in subjectam charte mundæ——schedam decutiatur, detergatúrve,
& deinde in acervum converratur, vesicularum seminalium plurimis unà
dissilientibus, & sibi invicem allisis, acervulus variè moveri per partes
videbitur, non secus ac si Syronibus aut istiusmodi bestiolis repletus
esset——quin si locus tranquillus sit, aura proximè admotâ crepitantium
inter rumpendum vasculorum sonitus——percipietur; & si microscopio chartam
oculis oberres, semina per eam undique sparsa, & ad notabilem ab acervo
distantiam projecta comperies._ _Ray_ ibid. p. 132.

_The admirable Contrivance of Nature, in this Plant is most plain. For
the Seed-Vessels being the best Preserver of the Seed, ’tis there kept
from the Injuries of Air and Earth, ’till it be rainy, when it is a
proper Time for it to grow, and then it is thrown round the Earth, as
Grain by a skilful Sower.——When any Wet touches the End of the Seed
Vessels, with a smart Noise and sudden Leap it opens it self, and with a
Spring scatters its Seed to a pretty Distance round it, where it grows._
Dr. Sloane Voy. to Jamaica, p. 150. of the _Gentianella flore cœruleo_,
&c. or _Spirit-Leaf_.

The Plants of the _Cardamine-Family_, and many others, may be added
here, whose Cods fly open, and dart out their Seed, upon a small Touch
of the Hand. But the most remarkable Instance is in the _Cardamine
impatiens, cujus Siliquæ_ (saith Mr. _Ray_) _vel leviter tactæ, actutùm
ejaculantur ~[Semina]~ imò, quod longè mirabilius videtur, etsi filiquas
non tetigeris, si tamen manum velut tacturus proximè admoveas, semina
in approprinquantem evibrabunt; quod tum Morisonus se sæpiùs expertum
scribit, tum Johnstonus apud Gerardum verum esse affirmat._ Hist. Plant.
L. 16. c. 20.

Neither is this Provision made only for Land Vegetables, but for such
also as grow in the Sea. Of which I shall give an Instance from my before
commended Friend Dr. _Sloane_. _As to the Fuci,——their Seed hath been
discover’d, (and shew’d me first,) by the Industry of the ingenious
Herbarist, Mr. ~Sam. Doody~, who found on many of this Kind, solid
Tubercules, or Risings in some Seasons, wherein were lodg’d several round
Seeds, as big as Mustard-Seed, which, when ripe, the outward Membrane of
the Tubercule breaking, leaveth the seed to float up and down with the
Waves. The Seed coming near Stones, or any solid Foundation, by Means of
a Mucilage it carries with it, sticks to them, and shoots forth ~Ligulæ~
with Branches, and in Time comes to its Perfection and Magnitude._ Sloan
Voy. Jamaica, p. 50.

But although Mr. _Doody_ had hinted, and conjectur’d at the Thing; yet
the first that discover’d the Seeds in _Fuci_, was the before commended
Dr. _Tancred Robinson_; as may be seen by comparing what Mr. Ray saith
in his _Synops. Stirp. Brit._ p. 6. with his _Append. Hist._ p. 1849.
Besides which _Fuci_, the Dr. tells me, he observ’d Vessels and Seed in
_Coralloid Shrubs_, as also in several _Fungi_, not only in the Species
of _Crepitus Lupi_, but also between the _Lamellæ_ of other Species, and
in that subterraneous Kind call’d _Truffles_, whose Seed and Vessels open
in the Cortex, at some Seasons he saith, like that of Mallows in Shape.

As to the _Crepitus Lupi_, I have more than once examin’d their Powder,
with those excellent Microscopes of Mr. _Wilson_’s Make: But the most
satisfactory View Mr. _Wilson_ himself gave me; by which I found the
Seeds to be so many exceeding small _Puff-Balls_, with round Heads, and
longer than ordinary sharp-pointed Stalks, as if made on purpose to
prick easily into the Ground. These Seeds are intermix’d with much dusty
Matter, and become hurtful to the Eyes, probably by their sharp Stalks
pricking and wounding that tender Organ.

[q] The ancient Naturalists do generally agree, that _Misseltoe_ is
propagated by its Seeds carried about by, and passing through the Body
of Birds. Thus _Theophrastus de Caus. Plant._ L. 2. c. 24. τὸ δὲ ἀπὸ
σῆς ὀρνίθων, &c. _Initium verò à pastu avium:——Quippe Visco detracto
confectóque in alveïs, quod frigidissimum est, semen cum excremento
purum dimittitur, & factâ mutatione aliquâ in arbore Stercoris causâ
pullulat, erumpitque, ~&c.~_ So also _Pliny_ saith, viz. _Omnino
autem satum ~[Viscum]~ nullo modo nascitur, nec nisi per alvum Avium
reddittum, maximè Palumbis ac Turdi. Hæc est natura, ut nisi maturatum
in ventre Avium, non proveniat._ Plin. N. H. L. 16. c. 44. Whether what
_Theophrastus_ and _Pliny_ affirm, be conducive to the better fertilizing
the Seeds of _Misseltoe_, I know not; but that it is not of absolute
Necessity, I can affirm upon mine own Experience, having seen the Seeds
germinate, even in the Bark of Oak. But although they shot above an
Inch, and seem’d to root in the Tree, yet they came to nothing, whether
destroy’d by Ants, _&c._ which I suspected, or whether disagreeing with
the Oak, I know not. But I since find the Matter put out of doubt by Mr.
_Doody_, which see in Mr. _Ray_’s _Hist. Plant. App._ p. 1918.

_Nutmegs_ are said to be fertiliz’d after the same Manner, as _Tavernier_
saith was confirm’d to him by Persons that lived many Years in those
Parts; whose Relation was, The _Nutmeg_ being ripe, several Birds come
from the Islands toward the South, and devour it whole, but are forced
to throw it up again, before it be digested: And that the _Nutmeg_, then
besmear’d with a viscous Matter, falling to the Ground, takes Root, and
produces a Tree, which would never thrive, was it planted. _Tavern. of
the Commod. of the ~G. Mogul~._ And _Monsieur Thevenot_, in his Travels
to the _Indies_, gives this Account; The Tree is produc’d after this
Manner; there is a kind of Birds in the Island, that having pick’d off
the green Husk, swallow the Nuts, which having been some Time in their
Stomach, they void by the ordinary Way; and they fail not to take rooting
in the Place where they fall, and in Time to grow up to a Tree. This Bird
is shap’d like a _Cuckow_, and the _Dutch_ prohibit their Subjects under
Pain of Death, to kill any of them. _Vid._ _Sir T. Pope Blunt_’s _Nat.

But Mr. _Ray_ gives a somewhat different Account: _Hunc fructum ~[Nucem
Moschatam]~ variæ quidem aves depascuntur, sed maximè Columbæ genus album
& parvum, quæ dehiscente nucamento, illectæ suavitate Macis, hunc cum
Nuce eripiunt & devorant, nec nisi repletâ ingluvie capacissimâ saginam

Nucivoris nomen imposuerunt. Quas autem vorant Nuces, post integras per

[t] All Vegetables of a tall and spreading Growth, seem to have a
natural Tendency to a hemispherical Dilation, but generally confine
their Spreading within an Angle of 90 _gr._ as being the most becoming
and useful Disposition of its Parts and Branches. Now the shortest Way
to give a most graceful and useful filling to that Space of dilating and
spreading out, is to proceed in strait Lines, and to dispose of those
Lines, in a Variety of Parallels, _&c._ And to do that in a quadrantal
Space, _&c._ there appears but one way possible, and that is, to form
all the Intersections which the Shoots and Branches make, with Angles
of 45 _gr._ only. And I dare appeal to all if it be not in this Manner,
almost to a Nicety observ’d by Nature, _&c._ A visible Argument that the
plastic Capacities of Matter are govern’d and dispos’d by an all-wise and
infinite Agent, the native Strictnesses and Regularities of them plainly

Claspers are of a compound Nature, between that of a Root and a Trunk.
Their Use is sometimes for Support only; as in the Claspers of Vines,
Briony, _&c._ whose Branches being long, slender and fragile, would
fall by their own Weight, and that of their Fruit; but these Claspers
taking hold of any Thing that is at Hand: Which they do by a natural
Circumvolution which they have; (those of Briony have a retrograde Motion
about every third Circle, in the Form of a double Clasp; so that if they
miss one Way, they may catch the other.) Sometimes the Use of Claspers is
also for a Supply, as in the Trunk Roots of Ivy; which being a Plant that
mounts very high, and being of a closer and more compact Substance than
that of Vines, the Sap would not be sufficiently supply’d to the upper
Sprouts, unless these assisted the Mother Root; but these serve also for
Support too. Sometimes also they serve for Stabiliment, Propagation and
Shade; for the first of these serve the Claspers of Cucumers; for the
second, those, or rather the Trunk-Roots of _Chamomil_; and for all three
the Trunk-Roots of _Strawberries_. Harris _Lex. Tech. in verb._ Claspers.

[w] Vegetables afford not only Food to Irrationals, but also Physick,
if it be true which _Aristotle_ saith, and after him _Pliny_; which
latter in his 8th Book, Chap. 27. specifies divers Plants made use of as
Specificks, by divers, both Beasts and Birds: As _Dittany_ by wounded

[cc] The Description Dr. _Sloane_ gives of the _Wild-Pine_ is, that
its Leaves are chanelled fit to catch and convey Water down into their
Reservatories, that these Reservatories are so made, as to hold much
Water, and close at Top when full, to hinder its Evaporation; that these
Plants grow on the Arms of the Trees in the Woods every where [in those
Parts] as also on the Barks of their Trunks. And one Contrivance of
Nature in this Vegetable, he saith, is very admirable. The Seed hath
long and many Threads of _Tomentum_, not only that it may be carried
every where by the Wind——but also that it may by those Threads, when
driven through the Boughs, be held fast, and stick to the Arms, and
extant Parts of the Barks of Trees. So soon as it sprouts or germinates,
although it be on the under Part of a Bough,——its Leaves and Stalk rise
perpendicular, or strait up, because if it had any other Position, the
Cistern (before-mentioned, by which it is chiefly nourished——) made of
the hollow Leaves, could not hold Water, which is necessary for the
Nourishment and Life of the Plant——In Scarcity of Water, this Reservatory
is necessary and sufficient, not only for the Plant it self, but likewise
is very useful to Men, Birds, and all Sorts of Insects, whither they come
in Troops, and seldom go away without Refreshment. _Id. ib. p. 188._ and
_Phil. Trans._ Nᵒ. 251, where a Figure is of this notable Plant, as also
in _Lowthorp’s Abridg. V. 2. p. 669._

The _Wild-Pine_, so called, _&c._ hath Leaves that will hold a Pint and
a half, or Quart of Rain-Water; And this Water refreshes the Leaves,
and nourishes the Root. When we find these Pines, we stick our Knives
into the Leaves, just above the Root, and that lets out the Water, which
we catch in our Hats, as I have done many Times to my great Relief.

[dd] _Navarette_ tells us of a Tree called the _Bejuco_, which twines
about other Trees, with its End hanging downwards; and that Travellers
cut the Nib off it, and presently a Spout of Water runs out from it, as
clear as Crystal, enough and to spare for six or eight Men. I drank,
saith he, to my Satisfaction of it, found it cool and sweet, and would
drink it as often as I found it in my Way. It is a Juice and natural
Water. It is the common Relief of the Herds men on the Mountains. When
they are thirsty, they lay hold on the _Bejuco_, and drink their Fill.

The _Waterwith_ of _Jamaica_ hath the same Uses, concerning which, my
before-commended Friend, Dr. _Sloane_, favoured me with this Account from
his Original Papers: _This Vine growing on dry Hills, in the Woods, where
no Water is to be met with, its Trunk, if cut into Pieces two or three
Yards long, and held by either End to the Mouth, affords so plentifully a
limpid, innocent, and refreshing Water, or Sap, as gives new Life to the
droughty Traveller or Hunter. Whence this is very much celebrated by all
the Inhabitants of these Islands, as an immediate Gift of Providence to
their distressed Condition._

_Birch-Tree_. _In initiis Veris antequam folia prodiere, vulnerata dulcem

_Practical INFERENCES from the foregoing SURVEY._


Having in the preceding Books carried my Survey as far as I care at
present to engage my self, all that remaineth, is to draw some Inferences
from the foregoing Scene of the great Creator’s Works, and so conclude
this Part of my intended Work.




[Illustration]




CHAP. I.

_That GOD’s Works are Great and Excellent._


The first Inference I shall make, shall be by way of Confirmation of the
Text, That the _Works of the Lord are great_[a]. And this is necessary
to be observed, not against the Atheist only, but all other careless,
incurious Observers of God’s Works. Many of our useful Labours, and
some of our best modern Books shall be condemned with only this Note
of Reproach, That they are about trivial Matters[b], when in Truth
they are ingenious and noble Discoveries of the Works of _GOD_. And how
often will many own the World in general to be a Manifestation of the
Infinite Creator, but look upon the several Parts thereof as only Toys
and Trifles, scarce deserving their Regard? But in the foregoing (I may
call it) transient View I have given of this lower, and most slighted
Part of the Creation, I have, I hope, abundantly made out, that all the
Works of the Lord, from the most regarded, admired, and praised, to the
meanest and most slighted, are great and glorious Works, incomparably
contrived, and as admirably made, fitted up, and placed in the World. So
far then are any of the Works of the _LORD_, (even those esteemed the
meanest) from deserving to be disregarded, or contemned by us[c], that on
the contrary they deserve (as shall be shewn in the next Chapter) to be
_sought out, enquired after_, and _curiously_ and _diligently pryed into_
by us; as I have shewed the Word in the Text implies.

CHAP. II.

_That GOD’s Works ought to be enquir’d into, and that such Enquiries are
commendable._


The _Creator_ doubtless did not bestow so much Curiosity, and exquisite
Workmanship and Skill upon his Creatures, to be looked upon with a
careless, incurious Eye, especially to have them slighted or contemned;
but to be admired by the rational Part of the World, to magnify his
own Power, Wisdom and Goodness throughout all the World, and the Ages
thereof. And therefore we may look upon it as a great Error, not to
answer those Ends of the infinite _Creator_, but rather to oppose and
affront them. On the contrary, my Text commends _GOD_’s Works, not
only for being great, but also approves of those curious and ingenious
Enquirers, that _seek them out_, or _pry into them_. And the more we pry
into, and discover of them, the greater and more glorious we find them to
be, the more worthy of, and the more expressly to proclaim their great
_Creator_.

Commendable then are the Researches, which many amongst us have, of late
Years, made into the Works of Nature, more than hath been done in some
Ages before. And therefore when we are asked, _Cui Bono?_ To what Purpose
such Enquiries, such Pains, such Expense? The Answer is easy, It is to
answer the Ends for which _GOD_ bestowed so much Art, Wisdom and Power
about them, as well as given us Senses to view and survey them; and an
Understanding and Curiosity to search into them: It is to follow and
trace him, when and whither he leads us, that we may see and admire his
Handy-work our selves, and set it forth to others, that they may see,
admire and praise it also. I shall then conclude this Inference with what
_Elihu_ recommends, Job xxxvi. 24, 25. _Remember that thou magnify his
Work, which Men behold. Every Man may see it, Men may behold it afar off._




CHAP. III.

_That GOD’s Works are manifest to all: Whence the Unreasonableness of
Infidelity._


The concluding Words of the preceding Chapter suggests a third Inference,
that the Works of GOD are so visible to all the World, and withal such
manifest Indications of the Being, and Attributes of the infinite
Creator, that they plainly argue the Vileness and Perversness of the
Atheist, and leave him inexcusable. For it is a sign a Man is a wilful,
perverse Atheist, that will impute so glorious a Work, as the Creation
is, to any Thing, yea, a mere _Nothing_ (as Chance is) rather than to
_GOD_[a]. ’Tis a sign the Man is wilfully blind, that he is under the
Power of the Devil, under the Government of Prejudice, Lust, and Passion,
not right Reason, that will not discern what _every one can see, what
every Man may behold afar off_, even the Existence and Attributes of the
_CREATOR_ from his Works. For as _there is no Speech or Language where
their Voice is not heard, their Line is gone out through all the Earth,
and their Words to the End of the World_: So all, even the barbarous
Nations, that never heard of GOD, have from these his Works inferred the
Existence of a Deity, and paid their Homages to some Deity, although they
have been under great Mistakes in their Notions and Conclusions about
him. But however, this shews how naturally and universally all Mankind
agree, in deducing their Belief of a God from the Contemplation of his
Works, or as even _Epicurus_ himself, in _Tully_[b] saith, from _a Notion
that Nature it self hath imprinted upon the Minds of Men. For_, saith he,
_what Nation is there, or what kind of Men, that without any Teaching or
Instructions, have not a kind of Anticipation, or preconceived Notion of
a Deity?_

An Atheist therefore (if ever there was any such) may justly be esteemed
a Monster among rational Beings; a Thing hard to be met with in the
whole Tribe of Mankind; an Opposer of all the World[c]; a Rebel against
human Nature and Reason, as well as against his _GOD_.

But above all, monstrous is this, or would be, in such as have heard
of _GOD_, who have had the Benefit of the clear Gospel-Revelation. And
still more monstrous this would be, in one born and baptized in the
Christian Church, that hath studied Nature, and pried farther than others
into God’s Works. For such an one (if it be possible for such to be) to
deny the Existence, or any of the Attributes of _GOD_, would be a great
Argument of the infinite Inconvenience of those Sins of Intemperance,
Lust, and Riot, that have made the Man abandon his Reason, his Senses,
yea, I had almost said his very human Nature[d], to engage him thus to
deny the Being of _GOD_.

So also it is much the same monstrous Infidelity, at least betrays the
same atheistical Mind, to deny _GOD_’s Providence, Care and Government of
the World, or (which is a Spawn of the same _Epicurean Principles_) to
deny _Final Causes_[e] in God’s Works of Creation; or with the Profane in
_Psal._ lxxiii. 11. to say, _How doth God know? And is there Knowledge
in the most High?_ For as the witty and eloquent _Salvian_ saith[f],
_They that affirm nothing is seen by _GOD_, will, ~in all Probability~,
take away the Substance, as well as Sight of God.——But what so great
Madness_, saith he, _as that when a Man doth not deny _GOD_ to be the
Creator of all Things, he should deny him to be the Governour of them? Or
when he confesseth him to be the Maker, he should say, _GOD_ neglecteth
what he hath so made?_

_That GOD’s Works ought to excite us to Fear and Obedience to GOD._


Since the Works of the Creation are all of them so many Demonstrations
of the infinite Wisdom and Power of God, they may serve to us as so many
Arguments exciting us to the constant _Fear of God_, and to a steady,
hearty _Obedience_ to all his Laws. And thus we may make these Works as
serviceable to our spiritual Interest, as they all are to our Life, and
temporal Interest. For if whenever we see them, we would consider that
these are the Works of our infinite _Lord_ and _Master_, to whom we are
to be accountable for all our Thoughts, Words and Works, and that in
these we may see his infinite Power and Wisdom; this would check us in
Sinning, and excite us to serve and please him who is above all Controul,
and who hath our Life and whole Happiness in his Power. After this
manner _GOD_ himself argues with his own _foolish People, and without
Understanding, who had Eyes, and saw not, and had Ears, and heard not_,
Jer. v. 21, 22. _Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at
my Presence, which have placed the Sand for the Bound of the Sea, by a
perpetual Decree, that it cannot pass it; and though the Waves thereof
toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they
not pass over it?_

This was an Argument that the most ignorant, stupid Wretches could not
but apprehend; that a Being that had so vast and unruly an Element, as
the Sea, absolutely at his Command, ought to be feared and obeyed; and
that he ought to be considered as the Sovereign Lord of the World, on
whom the World’s Prosperity and Happiness did wholly depend; v. 24.
_Neither say they in their Heart, let us now fear the Lord our God, that
giveth Rain, both the former and the latter in his Season: He reserveth
unto us the appointed Weeks of the Harvest._




CHAP. V.

_That GOD’s Works ought to excite us to Thankfulness._


As the Demonstrations which _GOD_ hath given of his infinite _Power_ and
_Wisdom_ should excite us to Fear and Obedience; so I shall shew in this
Chapter, that the Demonstrations which he hath given of his infinite
_Goodness_ in his Works, may excite us to due Thankfulness and Praise.
It appears throughout the foregoing Survey, what Kindness _GOD_ hath
shewn to his Creatures in providing every Thing conducing to their Life,
Prosperity, and Happiness[a]; how they are all contrived and made in
the best Manner, placed in the fittest Places of the World for their
Habitation and Comfort; accoutered in the best Manner, and accommodated
with every, even all the minutest Things that may minister to their
Health, Happiness, Office, Occasions, and Business in the World.

Upon which Account, Thankfulness and Praise is so reasonable, so just a
Debt to the _Creator_, that the _Psalmist_ calleth upon all the Creatures
to praise God, in _Psalm_ cxlviii. _Praise him all his Angels, Praise him
all his Hosts; Sun, Moon, Stars of Light, Heavens of Heavens, and Waters
above the Heavens._ The Reason given for which is, ℣. 5, 6. _For he
commanded, and they were created; he hath also established them for ever
and ever; he hath made a Decree which they shall not pass._ And not these
Celestials alone, but the Creatures of the Earth and Waters too, even the
Meteors, _Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapours, stormy Winds fulfilling his
Word._ Yea, the very _Mountains and Hills, Trees, Beasts, and all Cattle,
creeping Things, and flying Fowl._ But in a particular manner, all the
Ranks and Orders, all the Ages and Sexes of Mankind are charged with
this Duty; _Let them praise the Name of the Lord, for his Name alone is
excellent; his Glory is above the Earth and Heavens_, ℣. 13.

And great Reason there is we should be excited to true and unfeigned
Thankfulness and Praise[b] to this our great Benefactor, if we reflect
upon what hath been shewn in the preceding Survey, that the _Creator_
hath done for Man alone, without any regard to the rest of the Creatures,
which some have held were made for the Sake of Man. Let us but reflect
upon the Excellence and Immortality of our Soul; the incomparable
Contrivance, and curious Structure of our Body; and the Care and Caution
taken for the Security and Happiness of our State, and we shall find,
that among the whole Race of Beings, Man hath especial Reason to magnify
the Creator’s Goodness, and with suitable ardent Affections to be
thankful unto him.

CHAP. VI.

_That we ought to pay GOD all due Homage and Worship, particularly that
of the Lord’s Day._


For a Conclusion of these Lectures, the last Thing I shall infer, from
the foregoing Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of _GOD_, shall
be, that we ought to pay _GOD_ all that _Homage_ and _Worship_ which his
Right of Creation and Dominion entitle him unto, and his great Mercies
call for from us. And forasmuch as the _Creator_ appointed, from the
very Creation, one Day in seven to his Service, it will not therefore be
improper to say something upon that Subject: And if I insist somewhat
particularly and largely thereon, the Congruity thereof to the Design of
these Lectures, and the foregoing Demonstration, together with the too
great Inadvertency about, and Neglect of this ancient, universal, and
most reasonable and necessary Duty, will, I hope, plead my Excuse. But
that I may say no more than is necessary on this Point, I shall confine
my self to two things, the _Time_ God hath taken, and the _Business_ then
to be performed.

I. The _Time_ is one Day in seven, and one of the ancientest Appointments
it is which _GOD_ gave to the World. For as soon as _GOD_ had finished
his six Days Works of Creation, it is said, _Gen._ ii. 2, 3. _he rested
on the seventh Day from all his Work which he had made. And _GOD_ blessed
the seventh day, and sanctified it, because that in it he had rested from
all his Work._ This Sanctification[a], and blessing the Seventh Day, was
setting it apart, as a Day of Distinction from the rest of the Week-Days,
and appropriating it to holy Uses and Purposes, namely, the Commemoration
of that great Work of the Creation, and paying Homage and Worship to that
infinite Being, who was the Effector of it.

This Day, thus consecrated from the Beginning, for the Celebration of the
τοῦ κόσμου γενέσιον the _World’s Birth-Day_, as _Philo_ calls it, was
probably in some measure forgotten in the following wicked Ages, which
God complains of, _Gen._ vi. 5. and so after the Flood likewise. But
after the Return out of _Ægypt_, when _GOD_ settled the _Jewish_ Polity,
he was pleased to renew this Day, and to establish it for a perpetual
standing Law. And accordingly it was observed down to our blessed
_SAVIOUR_’s Time, countenanced, and strictly observed by our great _LORD_
and Master himself, and his Apostles and Disciples in, and after his
Time; and although for good Reasons the Day was changed by them, yet a
seventh Day hath been constantly observed in all Ages of Christianity,
down to our present Time.

Thus we have a Day appointed by _GOD_ himself, and observed throughout
all Ages, except some few perhaps, which deserve not to be brought into
Example.

And a wise Designation of Time this is, well becoming the divine Care
and Precaution; serving for the recruiting our Bodies, and dispatching
our Affairs, and at the same Time to keep up a Spiritual Temper of Mind.
For by allowing six Days to labour, the Poor hath Time to earn his
Bread, the Man of Business Time to dispatch his Affairs, and every Man
Time for the Work of his respective Calling. But had there been more,
or all our Time allotted to Labour and Business, and none to rest and
recruit, our Bodies and Spirits would have been too much fatigued and
wasted, and our Minds have been too long engaged about worldly Matters,
so as to have forgotten divine Things. But the infinitely wise Ruler of
the World, having taken the seventh Part of our Time to his own Service,
hath prevented these Inconveniencies; hath given a Relaxation to our
selves; and Ease and Refreshment to our wearied Beasts, to poor fatigued
Slaves, and such as are under the Bondage of avaritious, cruel Masters.
And this is one Reason _Moses_ gives of the Reservation and Rest on the
Seventh Day, _Deut._ v. 13, 14, 15. _Six Days shalt thou labour, and do
all thy Work; but the Seventh is the Sabbath of the _LORD_ thy _GOD_; in
it thou shalt not do any Work, thou, ~nor thy Children, Servants, Cattel,
or Stranger~, that thy Man Servant and Maid Servant may rest as well as
thou. And remember, that thou wast a Servant, ~&c.~ therefore the Lord
thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath Day._ That carnal, greedy
People, so bent upon Gain, without such a Precept, would have scarce
favoured their own Bodies, much less have had Mercy upon their poor
Bonds-men and Beasts, but by this wise Provision, this great Burden was
taken off. But on the other hand, as a longer Liberty would too much have
robbed the Master’s Time, and bred Idleness, so by this wise Provision,
of only one Day of Rest, to six of Labour, that inconvenience was also
prevented.

Thus the wise Governour of the World, hath taken Care for the Dispatch of
Business. But then as too long Engagement about worldly Matters, would
take off Mens Minds from God and divine Matters, so by this Reservation
of every Seventh Day, that great Inconvenience is prevented also; all
being then bound to worship their great Lord and Master, to pay their
Homages, and Acknowledgments to their infinitely kind Benefactor; and
in a word, to exercise themselves in divine, religious Business, and so
keep up that spiritual Temper of Mind, that a perpetual, or too long
Application to the World would destroy.

This, as it was a good Reason for the Order of a Sabbath to the _Jews_;
so is as good it Reason for our Saviour’s Continuance of the like Time in
the Christian Church.

And a Law this is, becoming the infinitely wise Creator and Conservator
of the World, a Law, not only of great Use to the perpetuating the
Remembrance of those greatest of God’s Mercies then commemorated, but
also exactly adapted to the Life, Occasions, and State of Man; of Man
living in this, and a-kin to another World: A Law well calculated to
the Dispatch of our Affairs, without hurting our Bodies or Minds. And
since the Law is so wise and good, we have great Reason then to practise
carefully the Duties incumbent upon us; which will fall under the
Consideration of the

II. Thing I proposed, the _Business_ of the Day, which God hath reserved
to himself. And there are two Things enjoyned in the Commandment, a
_Cessation_ from Labour and worldly Business, and that we _remember to
keep_ the Day holy.

1. There must be a Cessation from worldly Business, or a Rest from
Labour, as the Word _Sabbath_[b] signifies. _Six Days thou shalt do all
thy Work, but the Seventh is the Sabbath of the Lord thy _GOD_ ~(not thy
Day but his)~ in which neither thou, nor any belonging to thee, shall
do any Work._ In which Injunction it is observable, how express and
particular this Commandment is, more than others, in ordering all Sorts
of Persons to cease from Work.

2. We must _remember to keep the Day holy_. Which _Remembrance_ is
another Thing also in this, more than in the other Commandments, and
implies,

_1st_, That there is great Danger of our forgetting, neglecting, or being
hindred from keeping the Day holy, either by the Infirmity and Carnality
of our own Nature, or from the Avocations of the World.

_2ly_, That the keeping it holy, is a Duty of more than ordinary
Consequence and Necessity. And of greatest Consequence this is,

_First_, To perpetuate the Remembrance of those grand Works of _GOD_
commemorated on that Day; in the first Ages of the World, the Creation;
in the middle Ages, the Creation and Delivery from _Ægypt_; and under
Christianity, the Creation and Redemption by Christ. Which Mercies,
without such frequent Occasions, would be ready to be forgotten, or
disregarded, in so long a Tract of Time, as the World hath already stood,
and may, by God’s Mercy still stand.

_Secondly_, To keep up a spiritual Temper of Mind, by those frequent
weekly Exercises of Religion, as hath been already mention’d.

_Thirdly_, To procure _GOD_’s Blessing upon the Labours and Business of
our six Days, which we can never expect should be prosperous, if we are
negligent of _GOD_’s Time. For how can we expect _GOD_’s Blessing upon
a Week so ill begun, with a Neglect, or Abuse of _GOD_’s first Day? And
therefore if we become unprosperous in the World; if Losses, Troubles or
Dangers befall us, let us reflect how we have spent the _Lord’s_ Day;
whether we have not wholly neglected it, or abused it in Riot, or made it
a Day for taking Journeys, for more private Business, and less scandalous
Labour, as the Custom of too many is.

Thus having shewn what Reason there is to _remember_ to keep holy the
Day dedicated to _GOD_, I shall consider how we are to keep it holy,
and so conclude. Now the Way to keep it holy, is not by bare resting
from Work; for that, as a Father saith, is _Sabbatum Boum & Asinorum, a
Sabbath of Beasts_: But holy Acts are the proper Business for a holy Day,
celebrated by rational Beings. Among all which, the grand, principal,
and most universally practis’d, is the _Publick Worship of _GOD_, the
assembling at the _publick Place_ of his _Worship_, to pay (with our
Fellow-Creatures) our Homages, Thanks, and Praises to the infinite
_Creator_ and _Redeemer_ of the World. This as it is the most reasonable
Service, and proper Business for this Day, so is what hath been the
Practice of all Ages. It was as early as _Cain_ and _Abel_’s Days, _Gen._
iv. 3. what was practis’d by religious Persons in the following Ages,
till the giving of the Law; and at the giving of that, God was pleas’d
to order Places, and his particular Worship, as well as the seventh
Day. The Tabernacle and Temple were appointed by God’s express Command;
besides which, there were Synagogues all over the Nation; so that in our
Saviour’s Time, every great Town or Village had one, or more in it, and
_Jerusalem_ 460, or more[c].

The Worship of these Places, our blessed SAVIOUR was a constant and
diligent frequenter of. ’Tis said, _He went about all the Cities and
Villages, Teaching in their Synagogues, and Preaching, and Healing,
~&c.~_ _Mat._ ix. 35. And St. _Luke_ reporteth it as his constant Custom
or Practice, _Luke_ iv. 16. _And as his Custom was, he went into the
Synagogue on the Sabbath-Day._

Having thus mention’d the Practice of CHRIST, it is not necessary I
should say much of the Practice of his _Apostles_, and the following
purer Ages of Christianity, who, in short, as their Duty was, diligently
follow’d their great Master’s Example. _They did not think it enough
to read and pray, and praise God at Home, but made Conscience of
appearing in the publick Assemblies, from which nothing but Sickness and
absolute Necessity did detain them; and if Sick, or in Prison, or under
Banishment, nothing troubled them more, than that they could not come to
Church, and joyn their Devotions to the common Services. If Persecution
at any Time forc’d them to keep a little Close; yet no sooner was there
the least Mitigation, but they presently return’d to their open Duty, and
publickly met all together. No trivial Pretences, no light Excuses were
then admitted for any ones Absence from the Congregation, but according
to the Merit of the Cause, severe Censures were pass’d upon them, ~&c.~_
to express it in the Words of one of our best Antiquaries[d].

The _publick Worship_ of GOD then, is not a Matter of Indifference, which
Men have in their own Power to do, or omit as they please; neither is
it enough to read, pray, or praise God at Home, (unless some inevitable
Necessity hindereth;) because the appearing in GOD’s Home, on _his_
Day, is an Act of _Homage_ and _Fealty_, due to the CREATOR, a _Right
of Sovereignty_ we pay him. And the with-holding those Rights and Dues
from GOD, is a kind of rejecting GOD, a disowning his Sovereignty, and
a withdrawing our Obedience and Service. And this was the very Reason
why the Profanation of the Sabbath was punish’d with Death among the
_Jews_, the Sabbath being a Sign, or Badge of the _GOD_ they own’d and
worshipp’d.[e] Thus _Exod._ xxii. 13. _My Sabbaths ye shall keep; for
it is a SIGN between me and you, throughout your Generations; that ye
may know that I am the LORD, that doth sanctify you_; or as the Original
may be render’d, _a Sign to acknowledge, that I ~Jehovah~ am your
Sanctifier_, or _your God_: For as our learned _Mede_ observes, _to be
the Sanctifier of a People, and to be their God, is all one_. So likewise
very expressly in _Ezek._ xx. 20. _Hallow my Sabbaths, and they shall
be a Sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your
GOD_; or rather as before, _to acknowledge that I JEHOVAH am your GOD_.

The Sabbath being thus a Sign, a Mark, or Badge, to acknowledge God
to be their God, it follows, that a Neglect or Contempt of that Day,
redounded to GOD; to slight that, was slighting God; to profane that, was
to affront God; for the Punishment of which, What more equitable Penalty
than Death? And although under Christianity, the Punishment is not made
Capital, yet have we no less Reason for the strict Observance of this
holy Day, than the _Jews_, but rather greater Reasons. For the GOD we
worship, is the same: If after six Days Labour, he was, by the Seventh,
own’d to be _GOD_, the _Creator_; no less is he by our Christian Lord’s
Day: If by the Celebration of the Sabbath, the Remembrance of their
Deliverance from the _Ægyptian_ Bondage was kept up, and GOD acknowledged
to be the Effecter thereof; we Christians have a greater Deliverance, we
own our Deliverance from Sin and Satan, wrought by a greater Redeemer
than _Moses_, even the blessed JESUS, whose Resurrection, and the
Completion of our Redemption thereby, was perform’d on the Christian
Lord’s-Day.

And now to sum up, and conclude these Inferences, and so put an End to
this Part of my Survey: Since it appears, that the Works of the LORD
are so great, so wisely contriv’d, so accurately made, as to deserve
to be enquired into; since they are also so manifest Demonstrations
of the Creator’s Being and Attributes, that all the World is sensible
thereof, to the great Reproach of Atheism: What remaineth? But that we
fear and obey so great and tremendous a Being; that we be truly thankful
for, and magnify and praise his infinite Mercy, manifested to us in
his Works. And forasmuch as he hath appointed a Day on Purpose, from
the Beginning, for these Services, that we may weekly meet together,
commemorate and celebrate the great Work of Creation, that we may pay
our Acts of Devotion, Worship, Homage and Fealty to him; and since this
is a wise and excellent Distribution of our Time, What should we do, but
conscientiously and faithfully pay GOD these his Rights and Dues? And as
carefully and diligently manage GOD’s Time and Discharge his Business
then, as we do our own upon our six Days; particularly that with the
pious _Psalmist_, _We love the Habitation of God’s House, and the Place
where his Honour dwelleth_; and therefore take up his good Resolution in
_Psal._ v. 7. with which I shall conclude; _But as for me, I will come
into thine House in the Multitude of thy Mercy, and in thy Fear will I
worship towards thy holy Temple._

Now to the same infinite _GOD_, the omnipotent Creator and Preserver
of the World, the most gracious Redeemer, Sanctifier, and Inspirer of
Mankind, be all Honour, Praise and Thanks, now and ever. _Amen._

[e] At this Day it is customary for Servants to wear the Livery of their
Masters, and others to bear Badges of their Order, Profession, Servility,
_&c._ So in former Ages, and divers Countries, it was usual to bear
Badges, Marks and Signs on divers Occasions. In _Ezek._ ix. 4. _A Mark
was to be set on the Forehead of those that lamented the Abominations
of the City_. The like was to be done upon them in _Rev._ vii. 3. and
ix. 4. So the Worshippers of the Beast, _Rev._ xiii. 16. were to receive
a χάραγμα, _A Mark in their right Hind, on their Foreheads_. Those
χαράγματα, Σφραγίδες, _Badges_, &c. were very common. Soldiers and Slaves
bare them in their Arms or Foreheads; such as were matriculated in the
_Heteriæ_, or Companies, bare the Badge or Mark of their Company; and
whoever listed himself into the Society of any of the several _Gods_,
received a χάραγμα, or a Mark in his Body, (commonly made with red-hot
Needles, or some burning in the Flesh,) of the God he had listed himself
under. And after Christianity was planted, the Christians had also
their _Sign of the Cross_. And not only Marks in their Flesh, Badges
on their Cloaths, _&c._ were usual; but also the Dedication of Days to
their imaginary Deities. Not to speak of their Festivals, _&c._ the
Days of the Week were all dedicated to some of their Deities. Among
the _Romans_, Sunday and Monday, to the _Sun_ and _Moon_; Tuesday to
_Mars_, Wednesday to _Mercury_, &c. So our _Saxon_ Ancestors did the
same; Sunday and Monday, (as the _Romans_ did,) to the _Sun_ and _Moon_;
Tuesday to _Tuysco_; Wednesday to _Woden_; Thursday to _Thor_; Friday to
_Friga_; and Saturday to _Seater_: An Account of which Deities, with the
Figures under which they were worshipp’d, may be met with in our learned
_Verstegan_, Chap. 3. p. 68.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
