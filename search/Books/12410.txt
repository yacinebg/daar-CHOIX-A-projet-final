 _To face
  page_
_Title_. Portrait bearing the inscription “MARCUS POLVS VENETVS TOTIVS
          ORBIS ET INDIE PEREGRATOR PRIMVS.” In the Gallery of Monsignor
          _Badia_ at Rome; copied by Sign. GIUSEPPE GNOLI, Rome.

  xxiv. Medallion, representing _Marco Polo_ in the PRISON of GENOA,
          dictating his story to Master RUSTICIAN of PISA, drawn by
          Signor QUINTO CENNI from a rough design by Sir HENRY YULE.

   29.  The celebrated CHRISTIAN INSCRIPTION OF SI-NGAN FU.
          Photolithographed by Mr. W. GRIGG, from a Rubbing of the
          original monument, given to the Editor by the _Baron F. von
          Richthofen_.

          This rubbing is more complete than that used in the first
          edition, for which the Editor was indebted to the kindness of
          _William Lockhart, Esq._

   79.  The LAKE of TALI (CARAJAN of Polo) from the Northern End.
          Woodcut after Lieut. DELAPORTE, borrowed from Lieut. GARNIER’S
          Narrative in the _Tour du Monde_.

   79.  Suspension Bridge, neighbourhood of TALI. From a photograph by
          M. Tannant.

  111.  The CITY of MIEN, with the Gold and Silver Towers. From a
          drawing by the Editor, based upon his sketches of the remains
          of the City so called by Marco Polo, viz., PAGÁN, the mediæval
          capital of Burma.

  131.  Itineraries of Marco Polo. No. V. The INDO-CHINESE COUNTRIES.
          With a small sketch extracted from a Chinese Map in the
          possession of _Baron von Richthofen_, showing the position of
          KIEN-CH’ANG, the _Caindu_ of Marco Polo.

  143.  Sketch Map exhibiting the VARIATIONS of the TWO GREAT RIVERS of

          Plan incised on Marble, and preserved in the Great Confucian
          Temple in the City.

          The date of the original set of Maps, of which this was one,
          is uncertain, owing to the partial illegibility of the
          Inscription; but it is subsequent to A.D. 1000. They were
          engraved on the Marble A.D. 1247. Many of the names have been
          obliterated, and a few of those given in the copy are filled
          up from modern information, as the Editor learns from _Mr.
          Wylie_, to whom he owes this valuable illustration.

  193.  Map of HANG-CHAU FU and its LAKE, from Chinese Sources.

          The Map as published in the former edition was based on a
          Chinese Map in the possession of _Dr. W. Lockhart_, with some
          particulars from Maps in a copy of the Local Topography,
          _Hang-Chau-fu-chi_, in the B. Museum Library. In the second
          edition the Map has been entirely redrawn by the Editor, with
          many corrections, and with the aid of new materials, supplied
          by the kindness of the _Rev. G. Moule_ of the Church Mission
          at Hang-chau. These materials embrace a Paper read by Mr.
          Moule before the N. China Branch of the R. As. Soc. at
          Shang-hai; a modern engraved Map of the City on a large scale;
          and a large MS. Map of the City and Lake, compiled by _John
          Shing_, Tailor, a Chinese Christian and Catechist;

          The small Side-plan is the City of SI-NGAN FU, from a plan
          published during the Mongol rule, in the 14th century, a
          tracing of which was sent by _Mr. Wylie_. The following
          references could not be introduced in lettering for want of

  213.  Plan of SOUTHERN PART of the CITY of KING-SZÉ (or Hang-chau),
          with the PALACE of the SUNG EMPERORS. From a Chinese Plan
          forming part of a Reprint of the official Topography of the
          City during the period _Hien-Shun_ (1265–1274) of the Sung
          Dynasty, _i.e._ the period terminated by the Mongol conquest
          of the City and Empire. Mr. Moule, who possesses the Chinese
          plan (with others of the same set), has come to the
          conclusion that it is a copy at second-hand. Names that are
          underlined are such as are preserved in the modern Map of
          Hang-chau. I am indebted for the use of the original plan to

        HERE BEGINS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERIOR OF CATHAY,
                  AND FIRST OF THE RIVER PULISANGHIN.


Now you must know that the Emperor sent the aforesaid Messer Marco
Polo, who is the author of this whole story, on business of his into
the Western Provinces. On that occasion he travelled from Cambaluc a
good four months’ journey towards the west.{1} And so now I will tell
you all that he saw on his travels as he went and returned.

When you leave the City of Cambaluc and have ridden ten miles, you
come to a very large river which is called PULISANGHIN, and flows into
the ocean, so that merchants with their merchandise ascend it from
the sea. Over this River there is a very fine stone bridge, so fine
indeed, that it has very few equals. The fashion of it is this: it is
300 paces in length, and it must have a good eight paces of width, for
ten mounted men can ride across it abreast. It has 24 arches and as
many water-mills, and ’tis all of very fine marble, well built and
firmly founded. Along the top of the bridge there is on either side a
parapet of marble slabs and columns, made in this way. At the beginning
of the bridge there is a marble column, and under it a marble lion,
so that the column stands upon the lion’s loins, whilst on the top of
the column there is a second marble lion, both being of great size and
beautifully executed sculpture. At the distance of a pace from this
column there is another precisely the same, also with its two lions,
and the space between them is closed with slabs of grey marble to
prevent people from falling over into the water. And thus the columns
run from space to space along either side of the bridge, so that
altogether it is a beautiful object.{2}

  NOTE 1.—[When Marco leaves the capital, he takes the main road,
  the “Imperial Highway,” from Peking to Si-ngan fu, _viâ_ Pao-ting,
  Cheng-ting, Hwai-luh, Taï-yuan, Ping-yang, and T’ung-kwan, on the
  Yellow River. Mr. G. F. Eaton, writing from Han-chung (_Jour.
  China Br. R. As. Soc._ XXVIII. No. 1) says it is a cart-road,
  except for six days between Taï-yuan and Hwai-luh, and that it
  takes twenty-nine days to go from Peking to Si-ngan, a figure
  which agrees well with Polo’s distances; it is also the time which
  Dr. Forke’s journey lasted; he left Peking on the 1st May, 1892,
  reached Taï-yuan on the 12th, and arrived at Si-ngan on the 30th
  (_Von Peking nach Ch’ang-an_). Mr. Rockhill left Peking on the
  17th December, 1888, reached T’aï-yuan on the 26th, crossed the
  Yellow River on the 5th January, and arrived at Si-ngan fu on the
  8th January, 1889, in twenty-two days, a distance of 916 miles.
  (_Land of the Lamas_, pp. 372–374.) M. Grenard left Si-ngan on
  the 10th November and reached Peking on the 16th December, 1894 =
  thirty-six days; he reckons 1389 kilometres = 863 miles. (See _Rev.
  C. Holcombe, Tour through Shan-hsi and Shen-hsi_ in _Jour. North
  China Br. R. A. S._ N. S. X. pp. 54–70.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—_Pul-i-Sangín_, the name which Marco gives the _River_,
  means in Persian simply (as Marsden noticed) “The Stone Bridge.” In
  a very different region the same name often occurs in the history
  of Timur applied to a certain bridge, in the country north of
  Badakhshan, over the Wakhsh branch of the Oxus. And the Turkish
  admiral Sidi ’Ali, travelling that way from India in the 16th
  century, applies the name, as it is applied here, to the river;
  for his journal tells us that beyond Kuláb he crossed “the _River
  Pulisangin_.”

  [Illustration: _A Housselin d._

   The Bridge of Pulisanghin. (From the _Livre des Merveilles_.)]

  We may easily suppose, therefore, that near Cambaluc also,
  the Bridge, first, and then the River, came to be known to
  the Persian-speaking foreigners of the court and city by this
  name. This supposition is however a little perplexed by the
  circumstance that Rashiduddin calls the _River_ the _Sangín_, and
  that _Sangkan_-Ho appears from the maps or citations of Martini,
  Klaproth, Neumann, and Pauthier to have been one of the _Chinese_
  names of the river, and indeed, Sankang is still the name of one of
  the confluents forming the Hwan Ho.

  [“By _Sanghin_, Polo renders the Chinese _Sang-kan_, by which name
  the River Hun-ho is already mentioned, in the 6th century of our
  era. _Hun-ho_ is also an ancient name; and the same river in
  ancient books is often called _Lu-Kou_ River also. All these names
  are in use up to the present time; but on modern Chinese maps, only
  the upper part of the river is termed _Sang-Kan ho_, whilst south
  of the inner Great Wall, and in the plain, the name of _Hun-ho_ is
  applied to it. _Hun ho_ means “Muddy River,” and the term is quite
  suitable. In the last century, the Emperor K’ien-lung ordered the
  Hun-ho to be named _Yung-ting ho_, a name found on modern maps, but
  the people always call it _Hun ho_.” (_Bretschneider, Peking_, p.
  54.)—H. C.]

  The River is that which appears in the maps as the Hwan Ho,
  Hun-ho, or Yongting Ho, flowing about 7 miles west of Peking
  towards the south-east and joining the Pe-Ho at Tientsin; and the
  Bridge is that which has been known for ages as the _Lu-kou-K’iao_
  or Bridge of Lukou, adjoining the town which is called in the
  Russian map of Peking _Feuchen_, but in the official Chinese Atlas
  _Kung-Keih-cheng_. (See Map at ch. xi. of Bk. II. in the first
  Volume.) [“Before arriving at the bridge the small walled city
  of _Kung-ki cheng_ is passed. This was founded in the first half
  of the 17th century. The people generally call it _Fei-ch’eng_.”
  (_Bretschneider, Peking_, p. 50.)—H. C.] It is described both by
  Magaillans and Lecomte, with some curious discrepancies, whilst
  each affords particulars corroborative of Polo’s account of the
  character of the bridge. The former calls it the finest bridge in
  China. Lecomte’s account says the bridge was the finest he had yet
  seen. “It is above 170 geometrical paces (850 feet) in length.
  The arches are small, but the rails or side-walls are made of a
  hard whitish stone resembling marble. These stones are more than 5
  feet long, 3 feet high, and 7 or 8 inches thick; supported at each
  end by pilasters adorned with mouldings and bearing the figures
  of lions.... The bridge is paved with great flat stones, so well
  joined that it is even as a floor.”

  Magaillans thinks Polo’s memory partially misled him, and that
  his description applies more correctly to another bridge on the
  same road, but some distance further west, over the Lieu-li Ho.
  For the bridge over the Hwan Ho had really but _thirteen_ arches,
  whereas that on the Lieu-li had, as Polo specifies, twenty-four.
  The engraving which we give of the Lu-kou K’iao from a Chinese work
  confirms this statement, for it shows but thirteen arches. And
  what Polo says of the navigation of the river is almost conclusive
  proof that Magaillans is right, and that our traveller’s memory
  confounded the two bridges. For the navigation of the Hwan Ho, even
  when its channel is full, is said to be impracticable on account of
  rapids, whilst the Lieu-li Ho, or “Glass River,” is, as its name
  implies, smooth, and navigable, and it is largely navigated by
  boats from the coal-mines of Fang-shan. The road crosses the latter
  about two leagues from Cho-chau. (See next chapter.)

  [The Rev. W. S. Ament (_M. Polo in Cambaluc_, p. 116–117) remarks
  regarding Yule’s quotation from Magaillans that “a glance at
  Chinese history would have explained to these gentlemen that there
  was no stone bridge over the Liu Li river till the days of Kia
  Tsing, the Ming Emperor, 1522 A.D., or more than one hundred and
  fifty years after Polo was dead. Hence he could not have confounded
  bridges, one of which he never saw. The Lu Kou Bridge was first
  constructed of stone by She Tsung, fourth Emperor of the Kin, in
  the period Ta Ting 1189 A.D., and was finished by Chang Tsung 1194
  A.D. Before that time it had been constructed of wood, and had been
  sometimes a stationary and often a floating bridge. The oldest
  account [end of 16th century] states that the bridge was pu 200
  in length, and specifically states that each pu was 5 feet, thus
  making the bridge 1000 feet long. It was called the Kuan Li Bridge.
  The Emperor, Kia Tsing of the Ming, was a great bridge builder. He
  reconstructed this bridge, adding strong embankments to prevent
  injury by floods. He also built the fine bridge over the Liu Li Ho,
  the Cho Chou Bridge over the Chü Ma Ho. What cannot be explained
  is Polo’s statement that the bridge had twenty-four arches, when
  the oldest accounts give no more than thirteen, there being eleven
  at the present time. The columns which supported the balustrade in
  Polo’s time rested upon the loins of sculptured lions. The account
  of the lions after the bridge was repaired by Kia Tsing says that
  there are so many that it is impossible to count them correctly,
  and gossip about the bridge says that several persons have lost
  their minds in making the attempt. The little walled city on the
  east end of the bridge, rightly called Kung Chi, popularly called
  Fei Ch’eng, is a monument to Ts’ung Chêng, the last of the Ming,
  who built it, hoping to check the advance of Li Tzu ch’eng, the
  great robber chief who finally proved too strong for him.”—H. C.]

  [Illustration: Bridge of Lu-ku k’iao.]

  The Bridge of Lu-kou is mentioned more than once in the history
  of the conquest of North China by Chinghiz. It was the scene of a
  notable mutiny of the troops of the _Kin_ Dynasty in 1215, which
  induced Chinghiz to break a treaty just concluded, and led to his
  capture of Peking.

  This bridge was begun, according to Klaproth, in 1189, and was five
  years a-building. On the 17th August, 1688, as Magaillans tells
  us, a great flood carried away two arches of the bridge, and the
  remainder soon fell. [Father Intorcetta, quoted by Bretschneider
  (_Peking_, p. 53), gives the 25th of July, 1668, as the date of
  the destruction of the bridge, which agrees well with the Chinese
  accounts.—H. C.] The bridge was renewed, but with only nine arches
  instead of thirteen, as appears from the following note of personal
  observation with which Dr. Lockhart has favoured me:

  “At 27 _li_ from Peking, by the western road leaving the gate of
  the Chinese city called Kwang-’an-măn, after passing the old walled
  town of Feuchen, you reach the bridge of _Lo-Ku-Kiao_. As it now
  stands it is a very long bridge of nine arches (real _arches_)
  spanning the valley of the Hwan Ho, and surrounded by beautiful
  scenery. The bridge is built of green sandstone, and has a good
  balustrade with short square pilasters crowned by small lions. It
  is in very good repair, and has a ceaseless traffic, being on the
  road to the coal-mines which supply the city. There is a pavilion
  at each end of the bridge with inscriptions, the one recording
  that K’ang-hi (1662–1723) _built_ the bridge, and the other that
  Kienlung (1736–1796) _repaired_ it.” These circumstances are
  strictly consistent with Magaillans’ account of the destruction of
  the mediæval bridge. Williamson describes the present bridge as
  about 700 feet long, and 12 feet wide in the middle part.

  [Dr. Bretschneider saw the bridge, and gives the following
  description of it: “The bridge is 350 ordinary paces long and 18
  broad. It is built of sandstone, and has on either side a stone
  balustrade of square columns, about 4 feet high, 140 on each
  side, each crowned by a sculptured lion over a foot high. Beside
  these there are a number of smaller lions placed irregularly on
  the necks, behind the legs, under the feet, or on the back of the
  larger ones. The space between the columns is closed by stone
  slabs. Four sculptured stone elephants lean with their foreheads
  against the edge of the balustrades. The bridge is supported
  by eleven arches. At each end of the bridge two pavilions with
  yellow roofs have been built, all with large marble tablets in
  them; two with inscriptions made by order of the Emperor K’ang-hi
  (1662–1723); and two with inscriptions of the time of K’ien-lung
  (1736–1796). On these tablets the history of the bridge is
  recorded.” Dr. Bretschneider adds that Dr. Lockhart is also right
  in counting nine arches, for he counts only the waterways, not the
  arches resting upon the banks of the river. Dr. Forke (p. 5) counts
  11 arches and 280 stone lions.—H. C.]

                            CHAPTER XXXVI.

                     ACCOUNT OF THE CITY OF JUJU.


When you leave the Bridge, and ride towards the west, finding all the
way excellent hostelries for travellers, with fine vineyards, fields,
and gardens, and springs of water, you come after 30 miles to a fine
large city called JUJU, where there are many abbeys of idolaters, and
the people live by trade and manufactures. They weave cloths of silk
and gold, and very fine taffetas.{1} Here too there are many hostelries
for travellers.{2}

After riding a mile beyond this city you find two roads, one of which
goes west and the other south-east. The westerly road is that through
Cathay, and the south-easterly one goes towards the province of
Manzi.{3}

Taking the westerly one through Cathay, and travelling by it for ten
days, you find a constant succession of cities and boroughs, with
numerous thriving villages, all abounding with trade and manufactures,
besides the fine fields and vineyards and dwellings of civilized
people; but nothing occurs worthy of special mention; and so I will
only speak of a kingdom called TAIANFU.


  NOTE 1.—The word is _sendaus_ (Pauthier), pl. of _sendal_, and in
  G. T. _sandal_. It does not seem perfectly known what this silk
  texture was, but as banners were made of it, and linings for richer
  stuffs, it appears to have been a light material, and is generally
  rendered _taffetas_. In _Richard Cœur de Lion_ we find

      “Many a pencel of sykelatoun
       And of sendel of grene and broun,”

  and also _pavilions_ of sendel; and in the Anglo-French ballad of
  the death of William Earl of Salisbury in St. Lewis’s battle on the
  Nile—

      “Le Meister du Temple brace les chivaux
       Et le Count Long-Espée depli les _sandaux_.”

  The oriflamme of France was made of _cendal_. Chaucer couples
  taffetas and sendal. His “Doctor of Physic”

      “In sanguin and in persë clad was allë,
       Linëd with taffata and with sendallë.”

  [La Curne, _Dict., s.v. Sendaus_ has: Silk stuff: “Somme de
  la delivrance des _sendaus_.” (_Nouv. Compt. de l’Arg._ p.
  19).—Godefroy, _Dict._, gives: “_Sendain_, adj., made with the
  stuff called cendal: Drap d’or _sendains_ (1392, _Test. de Blanche,
  duch d’Orl._, Ste-Croix, Arch. Loiret).” He says _s.v._ CENDAL,
  “_cendau, cendral, cendel, ... sendail_, ... étoffe légère de soie
  unie qui paraît avoir été analogue au taffetas.” “‘On faisait des
  _cendaux_ forts ou faibles, et on leur donnait toute sorte de
  couleurs. On s’en servait surtout pour vêtements et corsets, pour
  doublures de draps, de fourrures et d’autres étoffes de soie plus
  précieuses, enfin pour tenture d’appartements.’ (_Bourquelot, Foir.
  de Champ._ I. 261).”

      “J’ay de toilles de mainte guise,
       De sidonnes et de _cendaulx_.
       Soyes, satins blancs et vermaulx.”
         —_Greban, Mist. de la Pass._, 26826, _G. Paris_.—H. C.]

  The origin of the word seems also somewhat doubtful. The word Σενδἑς
  occurs in _Constant. Porphyrog. de Ceremoniis_ (Bonn, ed. I. 468),
  and this looks like a transfer of the Arabic _Săndăs_ or _Sundus_,
  which is applied by Bakui to the silk fabrics of Yezd. (_Not. et
  Ext._ II. 469.) Reiske thinks this is the origin of the Frank word,
  and connects its etymology with Sind. Others think that _sendal_
  and the other forms are modifications of the ancient _Sindon_, and
  this is Mr. Marsh’s view. (See also _Fr.-Michel, Recherches, etc._
  I. 212; _Dict. des Tissus_, II. 171 _seqq._)

  NOTE 2.—JÚJÚ is precisely the name given to this city by
  Rashiduddin, who notices the vineyards. Juju is CHO-CHAU, just at
  the distance specified from Peking, viz. 40 miles, and nearly 30
  from Pulisanghin or Lu-kou K’iao. The name of the town is printed
  _Tsochow_ by Mr. Williamson, and _Chechow_ in a late Report of a
  journey by Consul Oxenham. He calls it “a large town of the second
  order, situated on the banks of a small river flowing towards the
  south-east, viz. the Kiu-ma-Ho, a navigable stream. It had the
  appearance of being a place of considerable trade, and the streets
  were crowded with people.” (_Reports of Journeys in China and
  Japan_, etc. Presented to Parliament, 1869, p. 9.) The place is
  called _Jújú_ also in the Persian itinerary given by ’Izzat Ullah
  in _J. R. A. S._ VII. 308; and in one procured by Mr. Shaw. (_Proc.
  R. G. S._ XVI. p. 253.)

  [The Rev. W. S. Ament (_Marco Polo_, 119–120) writes, “the
  historian of the city of Cho-chau sounds the praises of the
  people for their religious spirit. He says:—‘It was the custom
  of the ancients to worship those who were before them. Thus
  students worshipped their instructors, farmers worshipped the
  first husbandman, workers in silk, the original silk-worker.
  Thus when calamities come upon the land, the virtuous among the
  people make offerings to the spirits of earth and heaven, the
  mountains, rivers, streams, etc. All these things are profitable.
  These customs should never be forgotten.’ After such instruction,
  we are prepared to find fifty-eight temples of every variety in
  this little city of about 20,000 inhabitants. There is a temple
  to the spirits of Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Rain, to the god of
  silk-workers, to the Horse-god, to the god of locusts, and the
  eight destructive insects, to the Five Dragons, to the King who
  quiets the waves. Besides these, there are all the orthodox temples
  to the ancient worthies, and some modern heroes. Liu Pei and Chang
  Fei, two of the three great heroes of the _San Kuo Chih_, being
  natives of Cho Chou, are each honoured with two temples, one in
  the native village, and one in the city. It is not often that one
  locality can give to a great empire two of its three most popular
  heroes: Liu Pei, Chang Fei, Kuan Yu.”

  “Judging from the condition of the country,” writes the Rev. W. S.
  Ament (p. 120), “one could hardly believe that this general region
  was the original home of the silk-worm, and doubtless the people
  who once lived here are the only people who ever saw the silk-worm
  in his wild state. The historian of Cho-Chou honestly remarks that
  he knows of no reason why the production of silk should have ceased
  there, except the fact that the worms refused to live there.... The
  palmy days of the silk industry were in the T’ang dynasty.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—“About a _li_ from the southern suburbs of this town,
  the great road to Shantung and the south-east diverged, causing
  an immediate diminution in the number of carts and travellers”
  (_Oxenham_). [From Peking “to Cheng-ting fu”, says Colonel Bell
  (_Proc. R. G. S._, XII. 1890, p. 58), “the route followed is the
  Great Southern highway; here the Great Central Asian highway leaves
  it.” The Rev. W. S. Ament says (_l.c._, 121) about the bifurcation
  of the road, one branch going on south-west to Pao-Ting fu and
  Shan-si, and one branch to Shantung and Ho-nan: “The union of
  the two roads at this point, bringing the travel and traffic of
  ten provinces, makes Cho Chou one of the most important cities
  in the Empire. The magistrate of this district is the only one,
  so far as we know, in the Empire who is relieved of the duty of
  welcoming and escorting transient officers. It was the multiplicity
  of such duties, so harassing, that persuaded Fang Kuan-ch’eng to
  write the couplet on one of the city gateways: _Jih pien ch’ung
  yao, wu shuang ti: T’ien hsia fan nan, ti yi Chou_. ‘In all the
  world, there is no place so public as this: for multiplied cares
  and trials, this is the first Chou.’ The people of Cho-Chou, of
  old celebrated for their religious spirit, are now well known for
  their literary enterprise.”—H. C.] This bifurcation of the roads
  is a notable point in Polo’s book. For after following the western
  road through Cathay, _i.e._ the northern provinces of China, to
  the borders of Tibet and the Indo-Chinese regions, our traveller
  will return, whimsically enough, not to the capital to take a fresh
  departure, but to this bifurcation outside of Chochau, and thence
  carry us south with him to Manzi, or China south of the Yellow
  River.

  Of a part of the road of which Polo speaks in the latter part of
  the chapter Williamson says: “The drive was a very beautiful one.
  Not only were the many villages almost hidden by foliage, but the
  road itself hereabouts is lined with trees.... The effect was to
  make the journey like a ramble through the avenues of some English
  park.” Beyond Tingchau however the country becomes more barren. (I.
  268.)




                            CHAPTER XXXVII.

                        THE KINGDOM OF TAIANFU.


After riding then those ten days from the city of Juju, you find
yourself in a kingdom called TAIANFU, and the city at which you arrive,
which is the capital, is also called Taianfu, a very great and fine
city. [But at the end of five days’ journey out of those ten, they say
there is a city unusually large and handsome called ACBALUC, whereat
terminate in this direction the hunting preserves of the Emperor,
within which no one dares to sport except the Emperor and his family,
and those who are on the books of the Grand Falconer. Beyond this limit
any one is at liberty to sport, if he be a gentleman. The Great Kaan,
however, scarcely ever went hunting in this direction, and hence the
game, particularly the hares, had increased and multiplied to such an
extent that all the crops of the Province were destroyed. The Great
Kaan being informed of this, proceeded thither with all his Court, and
the game that was taken was past counting.]{1}

Taianfu{2} is a place of great trade and great industry, for here they
manufacture a large quantity of the most necessary equipments for the
army of the Emperor. There grow here many excellent vines, supplying
great plenty of wine; and in all Cathay this is the only place where
wine is produced. It is carried hence all over the country.{3} There is
also a great deal of silk here, for the people have great quantities of
mulberry-trees and silk-worms.

From this city of Taianfu you ride westward again for seven days,
through fine districts with plenty of towns and boroughs, all enjoying
much trade and practising various kinds of industry. Out of these
districts go forth not a few great merchants, who travel to India and
other foreign regions, buying and selling and getting gain. After
those seven days’ journey you arrive at a city called PIANFU, a large
and important place, with a number of traders living by commerce and
industry. It is a place too where silk is largely produced.{4}

So we will leave it and tell you of a great city called Cachanfu. But
stay—first let us tell you about the noble castle called Caichu.


  NOTE 1.—Marsden translates the commencement of this passage, which
  is peculiar to Ramusio, and runs “_E in capo di cinque giornate
  delle predette dieci_,” by the words “At the end of five days’
  journey _beyond_ the ten,” but this is clearly wrong.[1] The place
  best suiting in position, as halfway between Cho-chau and T’ai-yuan
  fu, would be CHENG-TING FU, and I have little doubt that this
  is the place intended. The title of _Ak-Báligh_ in Turki,[2] or
  _Chaghán Balghásun_ in Mongol, meaning “White City,” was applied
  by the Tartars to Royal Residences; and possibly Cheng-ting fu
  may have had such a claim, for I observe in the _Annales de la
  Prop. de la Foi_ (xxxiii. 387) that in 1862 the Chinese Government
  granted to the R. C. Vicar-Apostolic of Chihli the ruined _Imperial
  Palace_ at Cheng-ting fu for his cathedral and other mission
  establishments. Moreover, as a matter of fact, Rashiduddin’s
  account of Chinghiz’s campaign in northern China in 1214, speaks of
  the city of “Chaghan Balghasun which the Chinese call _Jintzinfu_.”
  This is almost exactly the way in which the name of Cheng-ting fu
  is represented in ’Izzat Ullah’s Persian Itinerary (_Jigdzinfu_,
  evidently a clerical error for _Jingdzinfu_), so I think there
  can be little doubt that Cheng-ting fu is the place intended. The
  name of Hwai-luh’ien (see Note 2), which is the first stage beyond
  Cheng-ting fu, is said to mean the “Deer-lair,” pointing apparently
  to the old character of the tract as a game-preserve. The city of
  Cheng-ting is described by Consul Oxenham as being now in a decayed
  and dilapidated condition, consisting only of two long streets
  crossing at right angles. It is noted for the manufacture of images
  of Buddha from Shan-si iron. (_Consular Reports_, p. 10; _Erdmann_,
  331.)

  [The main road turns due west at Cheng-ting fu, and enters Shan-si
  through what is known among Chinese travellers as the Ku-kwan,
  Customs’ Barrier.—H. C.]

  Between Cheng-ting fu and T’ai-yuan fu the traveller first crosses
  a high and rugged range of mountains, and then ascends by narrow
  defiles to the plateau of Shan-si. But of these features Polo’s
  excessive condensation takes no notice.

  The traveller who quits the great plain of Chihli [which terminates
  at Fu-ch’eng-i, a small market-town, two days from Pao-ting.—H. C.]
  for “the kingdom of Taianfu,” _i.e._ Northern Shan-si, enters a
  tract in which predominates that very remarkable formation called
  by the Chinese _Hwang-tu_, and to which the German name _Löss_ has
  been attached. With this formation are bound up the distinguishing
  characters of Northern Interior China, not merely in scenery but
  in agricultural products, dwellings, and means of transport.
  This _Löss_ is a brownish-yellow loam, highly porous, spreading
  over low and high ground alike, smoothing over irregularities of
  surface, and often more than 1000 feet in thickness. It has no
  stratification, but tends to cleave vertically, and is traversed in
  every direction by sudden crevices, almost glacier-like, narrow,
  with vertical walls of great depth, and infinite ramification.
  Smooth as the löss basin looks in a bird’s-eye view, it is thus
  one of the most impracticable countries conceivable for military
  movements, and secures extraordinary value to fortresses in
  well-chosen sites, such as that of Tung-kwan mentioned in Note 2 to
  chap. xli.

  Agriculture may be said in N. China to be confined to the alluvial
  plains and the löss; as in S. China to the alluvial plains and
  the terraced hill-sides. The löss has some peculiar quality which
  renders its productive power self-renewing without manure (unless
  it be in the form of a surface coat of fresh löss), and unfailing
  in returns if there be sufficient rain. This singular formation is
  supposed by Baron Richthofen, who has studied it more extensively
  than any one, to be no subaqueous deposit, but to be the
  accumulated residue of countless generations of herbaceous plants
  combined with a large amount of material spread over the face of
  the ground by the winds and surface waters.

  [I do not agree with the theory of Baron von Richthofen, of the
  almost exclusive Eolian formation of _loess_; water has something
  to do with it as well as wind, and I think it is more exact to say
  that loess _in China_ is due to a double action, Neptunian as well
  as Eolian. The climate was different in former ages from what it
  is now, and rain was plentiful and to its great quantity was due
  the fertility of this yellow soil. (Cf. _A. de Lapparent, Leçons de
  Géographie Physique_, 2ᵉ éd. 1898, p. 566.)—H. C.]

  Though we do not expect to find Polo taking note of geological
  features, we are surprised to find no mention of a characteristic
  of Shan-si and the adjoining districts, which is due to the _löss_;
  viz. the practice of forming cave dwellings in it; these in fact
  form the habitations of a majority of the people in the löss
  country. Polo _has_ noticed a similar usage in Badakhshan (I. p.
  161), and it will be curious if a better acquaintance with that
  region should disclose a surface formation analogous to the _löss_.
  (_Richthofen’s Letters_, VII. 13 _et passim_.)

  NOTE 2.—Taianfu is, as Magaillans pointed out, T’AI-YUAN FU, the
  capital of the Province of Shan-si, and Shan-si is the “Kingdom.”
  The city was, however, the capital of the great T’ang Dynasty for a
  time in the 8th century, and is probably the _Tájah_ or _Taiyúnah_
  of old Arab writers. Mr. Williamson speaks of it as a very pleasant
  city at the north end of a most fertile and beautiful plain,
  between two noble ranges of mountains. It was a residence, he
  says, also of the Ming princes, and is laid out in Peking fashion,
  even to mimicking the Coal-Hill and Lake of the Imperial Gardens.
  It stands about 3000 feet above the sea [on the left bank of the
  Fen-ho.—H. C.]. There is still an Imperial factory of artillery,
  matchlocks, etc., as well as a powder mill; and fine carpets like
  those of Turkey are also manufactured. The city is not, however,
  now, according to Baron Richthofen, very populous, and conveys no
  impression of wealth or commercial importance. [In an interesting
  article on this city, the Rev. G. B. Farthing writes (_North China
  Herald_, 7th September, 1894): “The configuration of the ground
  enclosed by T’ai-yuan fu city is that of a ‘three times to stretch
  recumbent cow.’ The site was chosen and described by Li Chun-feng,
  a celebrated professor of geomancy in the days of the T’angs, who
  lived during the reign of the Emperor T’ai Tsung of that ilk. The
  city having been then founded, its history reaches back to that
  date. Since that time the cow has stretched twice.... T’ai-yuan
  city is square, and surrounded by a wall of earth, of which the
  outer face is bricked. The height of the wall varies from thirty to
  fifty feet, and it is so broad that two carriages could easily pass
  one another upon it. The natives would tell you that each of the
  sides is three miles, thirteen paces in length, but this, possibly,
  includes what it will be when the cow shall have stretched for the
  third and last time. Two miles is the length of each side; eight
  miles to tramp if you wish to go round the four of them.”—H. C.]
  The district used to be much noted for cutlery and hardware, iron
  as well as coal being abundantly produced in Shan-si. Apparently
  the present Birmingham of this region is a town called Hwai-lu, or
  Hwo-luh’ien, about 20 miles west of Cheng-ting fu, and just on the
  western verge of the great plain of Chihli. [Regarding Hwai-lu,
  the Rev. C. Holcombe calls it “a miserable town lying among the
  foot hills, and at the mouth of the valley, up which the road into
  Shan-si lies.” He writes (p. 59) that Ping-ting chau, after the
  Customs’ barrier (Ku Kwan) between Chih-li and Shan-si, would,
  under any proper system of management, at no distant day become
  the Pittsburg, or Birmingham, of China.—H. C.] (_Richthofen’s
  Letters_, No. VII. 20; _Cathay_, xcvii. cxiii. cxciv.; _Rennie_,
  II. 265; _Williamson’s Journeys in North China; Oxenham_, u.s.
  11; _Klaproth_ in _J. As._ sér. II. tom. i. 100; _Izzat Ullah’s
  Pers. Itin._ in _J. R. A. S._ VII. 307; _Forke, Von Peking nach
  Ch’ang-an_, p. 23.)

  [“From Khavailu (Hwo-luh’ien), an important commercial centre
  supplying Shansi, for 130 miles to Sze-tien, the road traverses
  the loess hills, which extend from the Peking-Kalgan road in a
  south-west direction to the Yellow River, and which are passable
  throughout this length only by the Great Central Asian trade
  route to T’ai-yuan fu and by the Tung-Kwan, Ho-nan, _i.e._ the
  Yellow River route.” (_Colonel Bell, Proc. R. G. S._ XII. 1890, p.
  59.) Colonel Bell reckons seven days (218 miles) from Peking to
  Hwo-lu-h’ien and five days from this place to T’ai-yuan fu.—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—Martini observes that the grapes in Shan-si were very
  abundant and the best in China. The Chinese used them only as
  raisins, but wine was made there for the use of the early Jesuit
  Missions, and their successors continue to make it. Klaproth,
  however, tells us that the wine of T’ai-yuan fu was celebrated
  in the days of the T’ang Dynasty, and used to be sent in tribute
  to the Emperors. Under the Mongols the use of this wine spread
  greatly. The founder of the Ming accepted the offering of wine
  of the vine from T’ai-yuan in 1373, but prohibited its being
  presented again. The finest grapes are produced in the district
  of Yukau-hien, where hills shield the plain from north winds,
  and convert it into a garden many square miles in extent. In the
  vintage season the best grapes sell for less than a farthing a
  pound. [Mr. Theos. Sampson, in an article on “Grapes in China,”
  writes (_Notes and Queries on China and Japan_, April, 1869, p.
  50): “The earliest mention of the grape in Chinese literature
  appears to be contained in the chapter on the nations of Central
  Asia, entitled _Ta Yuan Chwan_, or description of Fergana, which
  forms part of the historical records (_Sze-Ki_) of Sze-ma Tsien,
  dating from B.C. 100. Writing of the political relations instituted
  shortly before this date by the Emperor Wu Ti with the nations
  beyond the Western frontiers of China, the historian dwells at
  considerable length, but unluckily with much obscurity, on the
  various missions despatched westward under the leadership of Chang
  K’ien and others, and mentions the grape vine in the following
  passage:—‘Throughout the country of Fergana, wine is made from
  grapes, and the wealthy lay up stores of wine, many tens of
  thousands of _shih_ in amount, which may be kept for scores of
  years without spoiling. Wine is the common beverage, and for horses
  the _mu-su_ is the ordinary pasture. The envoys from China brought
  back seeds with them, and hereupon the Emperor for the first time
  cultivated the grape and the mu-su in the most productive soils.’
  In the Description of Western regions, forming part of the History
  of the Han Dynasty, it is stated that grapes are abundantly
  produced in the country of K’i-pin (identified with Cophene, part
  of modern Afghanistan) and other adjacent countries, and referring,
  if I mistake not, to the journeys of Chang K’ien, the same work
  says, that the Emperor Wu-Ti despatched upwards of ten envoys to
  the various countries westward of Fergana, to search for novelties,
  and that they returned with grape and mu-su seeds. These references
  appear beyond question to determine the fact that grapes were
  introduced from Western—or, as we term it, Central—Asia, by Chang
  K’ien.”

  Dr. Bretschneider (_Botanicon Sinicum_, I. p. 25), relating the
  mission of Chang K’ien (139 B.C. Emperor Wu-Ti), who died about
  B.C. 103, writes:—“He is said to have introduced many useful plants
  from Western Asia into China. Ancient Chinese authors ascribe to
  him the introduction of the Vine, the Pomegranate, Safflower, the
  Common Bean, the Cucumber, Lucerne, Coriander, the Walnut-tree, and
  other plants.”—H. C.] The river that flows down from Shan-si by
  Cheng-ting-fu is called “Putu-ho, or the Grape River.” (_J. As._
  u.s.; _Richthofen_, u.s.)

  [Regarding the name of this river, the Rev. C. Holcombe (_l.c._ p.
  56) writes: “Williamson states in his _Journeys in North China_
  that the name of this stream is, properly _Poo-too Ho_—‘Grape
  River,’ but is sometimes written Hu-t’ou River incorrectly. The
  above named author, however, is himself in error, the name given
  above [_Hu-t’o_] being invariably found in all Chinese authorities,
  as well as being the name by which the stream is known all along
  its course.”

  West of the Fan River, along the western border of the Central
  Plain of Shan-si, in the extreme northern point of which lies
  T’aï-yuan fu, the Rev. C. Holcombe says (p. 61), “is a large
  area, close under the hills, almost exclusively given up to the
  cultivation of the grape. The grapes are unusually large, and of
  delicious flavour.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 4.—✛In no part of China probably, says Richthofen, do the
  towns and villages consist of houses so substantial and costly
  as in this. Pianfu is undoubtedly, as Magaillans again notices,
  P’ING-YANG FU.[3] It is the _Bikan_ of Shah Rukh’s ambassadors.
  [Old P’ing yang, 5 _lis_ to the south] is said to have been the
  residence of the primitive and mythical Chinese Emperor Yao. A
  great college for the education of the Mongols was instituted at
  P’ing-yang, by Yeliu Chutsai, the enlightened minister of Okkodai
  Khan. [Its dialect differs from the T’aï-yuan dialect, and is more
  like Pekingese.] The city, lying in a broad valley covered with
  the yellow löss, was destroyed by the T’aï-P’ing rebels, but it
  is reviving. [It is known for its black pottery.] The vicinity is
  noted for large paper factories. [“From T’ai-yuan fu to P’ing-yang

  (Colonel Bell, _Proc. R. G. S._ XII. 1890, p. 61.) By the way, Mr.
  Rockhill remarks (_Land of the Lamas_, p. 10): “Richthofen has
  transcribed the name of this river _Fuen_. This spelling has been
  adopted on most of the recent maps, both German and English, but
  _Fuen_ is an impossible sound in Chinese.” (Read _Fen ho_.)—H.

                           CHAPTER XXXVIII.

                   CONCERNING THE CASTLE OF CAICHU.


On leaving Pianfu you ride two days westward, and come to the noble
castle of CAICHU, which was built in time past by a king of that
country, whom they used to call the GOLDEN KING, and who had there a
great and beautiful palace. There is a great hall of this palace, in
which are pourtrayed all the ancient kings of the country, done in gold
and other beautiful colours, and a very fine sight they make. Each king
in succession as he reigned added to those pictures.{1}

[This Golden King was a great and potent Prince, and during his stay at
this place there used to be in his service none but beautiful girls,
of whom he had a great number in his Court. When he went to take the
air about the fortress, these girls used to draw him about in a little
carriage which they could easily move, and they would also be in
attendance on the King for everything pertaining to his convenience or
pleasure.{2}]

Now I will tell you a pretty passage that befell between the Golden
King and Prester John, as it was related by the people of the Castle.

It came to pass, as they told the tale, that this Golden King was at
war with Prester John. And the King held a position so strong that
Prester John was not able to get at him or to do him any scathe;
wherefore he was in great wrath. So seventeen gallants belonging to
Prester John’s Court came to him in a body, and said that, an he would,
they were ready to bring him the Golden King alive. His answer was,
that he desired nothing better, and would be much bounden to them if
they would do so.

So when they had taken leave of their Lord and Master Prester John,
they set off together, this goodly company of gallants, and went to
the Golden King, and presented themselves before him, saying that they
had come from foreign parts to enter his service. And he answered by
telling them that they were right welcome, and that he was glad to have
their service, never imagining that they had any ill intent. And so
these mischievous squires took service with the Golden King; and served
him so well that he grew to love them dearly.

And when they had abode with that King nearly two years, conducting
themselves like persons who thought of anything but treason, they one
day accompanied the King on a pleasure party when he had very few else
along with him: for in those gallants the King had perfect trust, and
thus kept them immediately about his person. So after they had crossed
a certain river that is about a mile from the castle, and saw that they
were alone with the King, they said one to another that now was the
time to achieve that they had come for. Then they all incontinently
drew, and told the King that he must go with them and make no
resistance, or they would slay him. The King at this was in alarm and
great astonishment, and said: “How then, good my sons, what thing is
this ye say? and whither would ye have me go?” They answered, and said:
“You shall come with us, will ye, nill ye, to Prester John our Lord.”


  NOTE 1.—The name of the castle is very doubtful. But of that and
  the geography, which in this part is tangled, we shall speak
  further on.

  Whilst the original French texts were unknown, the king here spoken
  of figured in the old Latin versions as King _Darius_, and in
  Ramusio as _Re Dor_. It was a most happy suggestion of Marsden’s,
  in absence of all knowledge of the fact that the original narrative
  was _French_, that this Dor represented the Emperor of the _Kin_ or
  Golden Dynasty, called by the Mongols _Altun Khán_, of which _Roi
  D’Or_ is a literal translation.

  [Illustration: The “Roi d’Or.” (From a MS. in the Royal Asiatic
    Society’s Collection.)

    “=Et en ceste chastiaus ha un mout biaus paleis en quel a une
    grandisme sale là ou il sunt portrait à mout belles pointures tout
    les rois de celes provences que furent ansienemant, et ce est mout
    belle viste à voir.=”]

  Of the legend itself I can find no trace. Rashiduddin relates
  a story of the grandfather of Aung Khan (Polo’s Prester John),
  Merghuz Boirúk Khan, being treacherously made over to the King of
  the Churché (the Kin sovereign), and put to death by being nailed
  to a wooden ass. But the same author tells us that Aung Khan got
  his title of Aung (Ch. _Wang_) or king from the Kin Emperor of his
  day, so that no hereditary feud seems deducible.

  Mr. Wylie, who is of opinion, like Baron Richthofen, that the
  _Caichu_ which Polo makes the scene of that story, is Kiai-chau (or
  Hiai-chau as it seems to be pronounced), north of the Yellow River,
  has been good enough to search the histories of the Liao and Kin
  Dynasties,[1] but without finding any trace of such a story, or of
  the Kin Emperors having resided in that neighbourhood.

  On the other hand, he points out that the story has a strong
  resemblance to a real event which occurred in Central Asia in the
  beginning of Polo’s century.

  The Persian historians of the Mongols relate that when Chinghiz
  defeated and slew Taiyang Khan, the king of the Naimans, Kushluk,
  the son of Taiyang, fled to the Gur-Khan of Karakhitai and received
  both his protection and the hand of his daughter (see i. 237); but
  afterwards rose against his benefactor and usurped his throne. “In
  the Liao history I read,” Mr. Wylie says, “that Chih-lu-ku, the
  last monarch of the Karakhitai line, ascended the throne in 1168,
  and in the 34th year of his reign, when out hunting one day in
  autumn, Kushluk, who had 8000 troops in ambush, made him prisoner,
  seized his throne and adopted the customs of the Liao, while he
  conferred on Chih-lu-ku the honourable title of _Tai-shang-hwang_
  ‘the old emperor.’”[2]

  It is this Kushluk, to whom Rubruquis assigns the rôle of King
  (or Prester) John, the subject of so many wonderful stories.
  And Mr. Wylie points out that not only was his father Taiyang
  Khan, according to the Chinese histories, a much more important
  prince than Aung Khan or Wang Khan the Kerait, but his name
  _Tai-Yang-Khan_ is precisely “Great King John” as near as John
  (or Yohana) can be expressed in Chinese. He thinks therefore that
  Taiyang and his son Kushluk, the Naimans, and not Aung Khan and his
  descendants, the Keraits, were the parties to whom the character of
  Prester John properly belonged, and that it was probably this story
  of Kushluk’s capture of the Karakhitai monarch (_Roi de Fer_) which
  got converted into the form in which he relates it of the _Roi
  d’Or_.

  The suggestion seems to me, as regards the story, interesting and
  probable; though I do not admit that the character of Prester John
  properly belonged to any real person.

  I may best explain my view of the matter by a geographical analogy.
  Pre-Columbian maps of the Atlantic showed an Island of Brazil, an
  Island of Antillia, founded—who knows on what?—whether on the real
  adventure of a vessel driven in sight of the Azores or Bermudas,
  or on mere fancy and fogbank. But when discovery really came to be
  undertaken, men looked for such lands and found them accordingly.
  And there they are in our geographies, Brazil and the Antilles!

  The cut which we give is curious in connection with our traveller’s
  notice of the portrait-gallery of the Golden Kings. For it is taken
  from the fragmentary MS. of Rashiduddin’s History in the library
  of the Royal Asiatic Society, a MS. believed to be one of those
  executed under the great Vazír’s own supervision, and is presented
  there as the portrait of the last sovereign of the Dynasty in
  question, being one of a whole series of similar figures. There
  can be little doubt, I think, that these were taken from Chinese
  originals, though, it may be, not very exactly.

  NOTE 2.—The history of the Tartar conquerors of China, whether
  Khitan, Churché, Mongol, or Manchu, has always been the same. For
  one or two generations the warlike character and manly habits were
  maintained; and then the intruders, having adopted Chinese manners,
  ceremonies, literature, and civilization, sank into more than
  Chinese effeminacy and degradation. We see the custom of employing
  only female attendants ascribed in a later chapter (lxxvii.) to
  the Sung Emperors at Kinsay; and the same was the custom of the
  later Ming emperors, in whose time the imperial palace was said
  to contain 5000 women. Indeed, the precise custom which this
  passage describes was in our own day habitually reported of the
  T’ai-P’ing sovereign during his reign at Nanking: “None but women
  are allowed in the interior of the Palace, and _he is drawn to the
  audience-chamber in a gilded sacred dragon-car by the ladies_.”

  41.)

                            CHAPTER XXXIX.

        HOW PRESTER JOHN TREATED THE GOLDEN KING HIS PRISONER.


And on this the Golden King was so sorely grieved that he was like
to die. And he said to them: “Good, my sons, for God’s sake have
pity and compassion upon me. Ye wot well what honourable and kindly
entertainment ye have had in my house; and now ye would deliver me
into the hands of mine enemy! In sooth, if ye do what ye say, ye will
do a very naughty and disloyal deed, and a right villainous.” But they
answered only that so it must be, and away they had him to Prester John
their Lord.

And when Prester John beheld the King he was right glad, and greeted
him with something like a malison.[1] The King answered not a word, as
if he wist not what it behoved him to say. So Prester John ordered him
to be taken forth straightway, and to be put to look after cattle, but
to be well looked after himself also. So they took him and set him to
keep cattle. This did Prester John of the grudge he bore the King, to
heap contumely on him, and to show what a nothing he was, compared to
himself.

And when the King had thus kept cattle for two years, Prester John sent
for him, and treated him with honour, and clothed him in rich robes,
and said to him: “Now Sir King, art thou satisfied that thou wast in
no way a man to stand against me?” “Truly, my good Lord, I know well
and always did know that I was in no way a man to stand against thee.”
And when he had said this Prester John replied: “I ask no more; but
henceforth thou shalt be waited on and honourably treated.” So he
caused horses and harness of war to be given him, with a goodly train,
and sent him back to his own country. And after that he remained ever
friendly to Prester John, and held fast by him.

So now I will say no more of this adventure of the Golden King, but I
will proceed with our subject.

                              CHAPTER XL.

    CONCERNING THE GREAT RIVER CARAMORAN AND THE CITY OF CACHANFU.


When you leave the castle, and travel about 20 miles westward, you come
to a river called CARAMORAN,{1} so big that no bridge can be thrown
across it; for it is of immense width and depth, and reaches to the
Great Ocean that encircles the Universe,—I mean the whole earth. On
this river there are many cities and walled towns, and many merchants
too therein, for much traffic takes place upon the river, there being
a great deal of ginger and a great deal of silk produced in the
country.{2}

Game birds here are in wonderful abundance, insomuch that you may buy
at least three pheasants for a Venice groat of silver. I should say
rather for an _asper_, which is worth a little more.{3}

[On the lands adjoining this river there grow vast quantities of great
canes, some of which are a foot or a foot and a half (in girth), and
these the natives employ for many useful purposes.]

After passing the river and travelling two days westward you come
to the noble city of CACHANFU, which we have already named. The
inhabitants are all Idolaters. And I may as well remind you again that
all the people of Cathay are Idolaters. It is a city of great trade
and of work in gold-tissues of many sorts, as well as other kinds of
industry.

There is nothing else worth mentioning, and so we will proceed and tell
you of a noble city which is the capital of a kingdom, and is called
Kenjanfu.


  NOTE 1.—_Ḳará-Muren_, or Black River, is one of the names applied
  by the Mongols to the Hwang Ho, or Yellow River, of the Chinese,
  and is used by all the mediæval western writers, _e.g._ Odoric,
  John Marignolli, Rashiduddin.

  The River, where it skirts Shan-si, is for the most part difficult
  both of access and of passage, and ill adapted to navigation, owing
  to the violence of the stream. Whatever there is of navigation is
  confined to the transport of coal down-stream from Western Shan-si,
  in large flats. Mr. Elias, who has noted the River’s level by
  aneroid at two points 920 miles apart, calculated the fall over
  that distance, which includes the contour of Shan-si, at 4 feet per
  mile. The best part for navigation is above this, from Ning-hia
  to Chaghan Kuren (in about 110° E. long.), in which Captain
  Prjevalski’s observations give a fall of less than 6 inches per
  mile. (_Richthofen_, _Letter_ VII. 25; _Williamson_, I. 69; _J. R.
  G. S._ XLIII. p. 115; _Petermann_, 1873, pp. 89–91.)

  [On 5th January, 1889, Mr. Rockhill coming to the Yellow River from
  P’ing-yang, found (_Land of the Lamas_, p. 17) that “the river was
  between 500 and 600 yards wide, a sluggish, muddy stream, then
  covered with floating ice about a foot thick.... The Yellow River
  here is shallow, in the main channel only is it four or five feet
  deep.” The Rev. C. Holcombe, who crossed in October, says (p. 65):
  that “it was nowhere more than 6 feet deep, and on returning, three
  of the boatmen sprang into the water in midstream and waded ashore,
  carrying a line from the ferry-boat to prevent us from rapidly
  drifting down with the current. The water was just up to their
  hips.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—It is remarkable that the abundance of silk in Shan-si and
  Shen-si is so distinctly mentioned in these chapters, whereas now
  there is next to no silk at all grown in these districts. Is this
  the result of a change of climate, or only a commercial change?
  Baron Richthofen, to whom I have referred the question, believes
  it to be due to the former cause: “No tract in China would appear
  to have suffered so much by a change of climate as Shen-si and
  Southern Shan-si.” [See pp. 11–12.]

  NOTE 3.—The _asper_ or _akché_ (both meaning “white”) of the
  Mongols at Tana or Azov I have elsewhere calculated, from
  Pegolotti’s data (_Cathay_, p. 298), to have contained about 0_s._
  2·8_d._ worth of silver, which is _less_ than the grosso; but the
  name may have had a loose application to small silver coins in
  other countries of Asia. Possibly the money intended may have been
  the 50 _tsien_ note. (See note 1, ch. xxiv. _supra_.)




                             CHAPTER XLI.

                   CONCERNING THE CITY OF KENJANFU.


And when you leave the city of Cachanfu of which I have spoken, and
travel eight days westward, you meet with cities and boroughs abounding
in trade and industry, and quantities of beautiful trees, and gardens,
and fine plains planted with mulberries, which are the trees on the
leaves of which the silkworms do feed.{1} The people are all Idolaters.
There is also plenty of game of all sorts, both of beasts and birds.

And when you have travelled those eight days’ journey, you come to that
great city which I mentioned, called KENJANFU.{2} A very great and fine
city it is, and the capital of the kingdom of Kenjanfu, which in old
times was a noble, rich, and powerful realm, and had many great and
wealthy and puissant kings.{3} But now the king thereof is a prince
called MANGALAI, the son of the Great Kaan, who hath given him this
realm, and crowned him king thereof.{4} It is a city of great trade
and industry. They have great abundance of silk, from which they weave
cloths of silk and gold of divers kinds, and they also manufacture
all sorts of equipments for an army. They have every necessary of
man’s life very cheap. The city lies towards the west; the people are
Idolaters; and outside the city is the palace of the Prince Mangalai,
crowned king, and son of the Great Kaan, as I told you before.

This is a fine palace and a great, as I will tell you. It stands in a
great plain abounding in lakes and streams and springs of water. Round
about it is a massive and lofty wall, five miles in compass, well
built, and all garnished with battlements. And within this wall is the
king’s palace, so great and fine that no one could imagine a finer.
There are in it many great and splendid halls, and many chambers, all
painted and embellished with work in beaten gold. This Mangalai rules
his realm right well with justice and equity, and is much beloved by
his people. The troops are quartered round about the palace, and enjoy
the sport (that the royal demesne affords).

So now let us quit this kingdom, and I will tell you of a very
mountainous province called Cuncun, which you reach by a road right
wearisome to travel.


  NOTE 1.—[“_Morus alba_ is largely grown in North China for feeding
  silkworms.” (_Bretschneider, Hist. of Bot. Disc._ I. p. 4.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—Having got to sure ground again at Kenjanfu, which is,
  as we shall explain presently, the city of SI-NGAN FU, capital
  of Shen-si, let us look back at the geography of the route from
  P’ing-yang fu. Its difficulties are great.

  The traveller carries us two days’ journey from P’ing-yang fu to
  his castle of the Golden King. This is called in the G. Text and
  most other MSS. _Caicui_, _Caytui_, or the like, but in Ramusio
  alone _Thaigin_. He then carries us 20 miles further to the
  Caramoran; he crosses this river, travels two days further, and
  reaches the great city Cachanfu; eight days more (or as in Ramusio
  _seven_) bring him to Si-ngan fu.

  There seems scarcely room for doubt that CACHANFU is the HO-CHUNG
  FU [the ancient capital of Emperor Shun—H. C.] of those days,
  now called P’U-CHAU FU, close to the great elbow of the Hwang Ho
  (_Klaproth_). But this city, instead of being _two days west_ of
  the great river, stands _near_ its _eastern_ bank.

  [The Rev. C. Holcombe writes (pp. 64–65): “P’u-chau fu lies on a
  level with the Yellow River, and on the edge of a large extent
  of worthless marsh land, full of pools of brackish, and in some
  places, positively salt water.... The great road does not pass
  into the town, having succeeded in maintaining its position on the
  high ground from which the town has _backslided_.... The great
  road keeping to the bluff, runs on, turning first south, and then
  a trifle to the east of south, until the road, the bluff, and
  Shan-si, all end together, making a sudden plunge down a precipice
  and being lost in the dirty waters of the Yellow River.”—H. C.]

  Not maintaining the infallibility of our traveller’s memory, we may
  conceive confusion here, between the recollections of his journey
  westward and those of his return; but this does not remove all the
  difficulties.

  The most notable fortress of the Kin sovereigns was that of
  T’ungkwan, on the right bank of the river, 25 miles below P’u-chau
  fu, and closing the passage between the river and the mountains,
  just where the boundaries of Ho-nan, Shan-si, and Shen-si meet. It
  was constantly the turning-point of the Mongol campaigns against
  that Dynasty, and held a prominent place in the dying instructions
  of Chinghiz for the prosecution of the conquest of Cathay. This
  fortress must have continued famous to Polo’s time—indeed it
  continues so still, the strategic position being one which nothing
  short of a geological catastrophe could impair,—but I see no way of
  reconciling its position with his narrative.

  [Illustration: Plan of Ki-chau, after Duhalde.]

  The _name_ in Ramusio’s form might be merely that of the Dynasty,
  viz. _Tai-Kin_ = Great Golden. But we have seen that Thaigin is
  not the only reading. That of the MSS. seems to point rather to
  some name like _Kaichau_. A hypothesis which has seemed to me to
  call for least correction in the text is that the castle was at
  the _Ki-chau_ of the maps, nearly due west of P’ing-yang fu, and
  just about 20 miles from the Hwang Ho; that the river was crossed
  in that vicinity, and that the traveller then descended the valley
  to opposite P’u-chau fu, or possibly embarked and descended the
  river itself to that point. This last hypothesis would mitigate the
  apparent disproportion in the times assigned to the different parts
  of the journey, and would, I think, clear the text of error. But
  it is only a hypothesis. There is near Ki-chau one of the easiest
  crossing places of the River, insomuch that since the Shen-si
  troubles a large garrison has been kept up at Ki-chau to watch
  it.[1] And this is the only direction in which two days’ march, at
  Polo’s rate, would bring him within 20 miles of the Yellow River.
  Whether there is any historic castle at Ki-chau I know not; the
  plan of that place in Duhalde, however, has the aspect of a strong
  position. Baron v. Richthofen is unable to accept this suggestion,
  and has favoured me with some valuable remarks on this difficult
  passage, which I slightly abridge:—

  “The difficulties are, (1) that for either reading, _Thaigin_ or
  _Caichu_, a corresponding place can be found; (2) in the position
  of _Cachanfu_, setting both at naught.

  “_Thaigin_. There are two passages of the Yellow River near its
  great bend. One is at T’ungkwan, where I crossed it; the other,
  and more convenient, is at the fortress of Taiching-kwan, locally
  pronounced _Taigin_-kwan. This fortress, or rather fortified camp,
  is a very well-known place, and to be found on native maps; it
  is very close to the river, on the left bank, about 6 m. S.W. of
  P’u-chau fu. The road runs hence to Tung-chau fu and thence to
  Si-ngan fu. T’aiching-kwan could not possibly (at Polo’s rate) be
  reached in 2 days from P’ing-yang fu.

  “_Caichu_. If this reading be adopted Marsden may be right in
  supposing _Kiai-chau_, locally _Khaidju_, to be meant. This city
  dominates the important salt marsh, whence Shan-si and Shen-si
  are supplied with salt. It is 70 or 80 m. from P’ing-yang fu, but
  _could_ be reached in 2 days. It commands a large and tolerably
  populous plain, and is quite fit to have been an imperial residence.

  “May not the striking fact that there is a place corresponding to
  either name suggest that one of them was passed by Polo in going,
  the other in returning? and that, this being the only locality
  between Ch’êng-tu fu and Chu-chau where there was any deviation
  between the two journeys, his geographical ideas may have become
  somewhat confused, as might now happen to any one in like case and
  not provided with a map? Thus the traveller himself might have put
  into Ramusio’s text the name of _Thaigin_ instead of _Caichu_. From
  Kiai-chau he would probably cross the River at T’ungkwan, whilst in
  returning by way of Taiching-kwan he would pass through P’uchau-fu
  (or _vice versâ_). The question as to Caichu may still be settled,
  as it must be possible to ascertain where the Kin resided.”[2]

  [Mr. Rockhill writes (_Land of the Lamas_, p. 17): “One hundred and
  twenty _li_ south-south-west of the city is Kiai Chou, with the
  largest salt works in China.” Richthofen has estimated that about
  150,000 tons of salt are produced annually from the marshes around
  it.—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—The eight days’ journey through richly cultivated plains
  run up the basin of the Wei River, the most important agricultural
  region of North-West China, and the core of early Chinese History.
  The _löss_ is here more than ever predominant, its yellow tinge
  affecting the whole landscape, and even the atmosphere. Here,
  according to Baron v. Richthofen, originated the use of the word
  _hwang_ “yellow,” as the symbol of the Earth, whence the primeval
  emperors were styled _Hwang-ti_, “Lord of the Earth,” but properly
  “Lord of the _Löss_.”

  [The Rev. C. Holcombe (_l.c._ p. 66) writes: “From T’ung-kwan to
  Si-ngan fu, the road runs in a direction nearly due west, through
  a most lovely section of country, having a range of high hills
  upon the south, and the Wei River on the north. The road lies
  through one long orchard, and the walled towns and cities lie
  thickly along, for the most part at a little distance from the
  highway.” Mr. Rockhill says (_Land of the Lamas_, pp. 19–20): “The
  road between T’ung-kwan and Si-ngan fu, a distance of 110 miles,
  is a fine highway—for China—with a ditch on either side, rows of
  willow-trees here and there, and substantial stone bridges and
  culverts over the little streams which cross it. The basin of the
  Wei ho, in which this part of the province lies, has been for
  thousands of years one of the granaries of China. It was the colour
  of its loess-covered soil, called ‘yellow earth’ by the Chinese,
  that suggested the use of yellow as the colour sacred to imperial

  numerous paddy fields where flocks of flamingoes were wading, and
  fruit-trees grew everywhere.”—H. C.]

  Kenjanfu, or, as Ramusio gives it, Quenzanfu, is SI-NGAN FU, or
  as it was called in the days of its greatest fame, Chang-ngan,
  probably the most celebrated city in Chinese history, and the
  capital of several of the most potent dynasties. It was the
  metropolis of Shi Hwang-ti of the T’sin Dynasty, properly the
  first emperor and whose conquests almost intersected those of his
  contemporary Ptolemy Euergetes. It was, perhaps, the _Thinae_
  of Claudius Ptolemy, as it was certainly the Khumdán[3] of the
  early Mahomedans, and the site of flourishing Christian Churches
  in the 7th century, as well as of the remarkable monument, the
  discovery of which a thousand years later disclosed their forgotten
  existence.[4] _Kingchao-fu_ was the name which the city bore when
  the Mongol invasions brought China into communication with the
  west, and Klaproth supposes that this was modified by the Mongols
  into KENJANFU. Under the latter name it is mentioned by Rashiduddin
  as the seat of one of the Twelve _Sings_ or great provincial
  administrations, and we find it still known by this name in
  Sharífuddin’s history of Timur. The same name is traceable in the
  _Kansan_ of Odoric, which he calls the second best province in the
  world, and the best populated. Whatever may have been the origin
  of the name _Kenjanfu_, Baron v. Richthofen was, on the spot, made
  aware of its conservation in the exact form of the Ramusian Polo.
  The Roman Catholic missionaries there emphatically denied that
  Marco could ever have been at Si-ngan fu, or that the city had ever
  been known by such a name as Kenjan-fu. On this the Baron called in
  one of the Chinese pupils of the Mission, and asked him directly
  what had been the name of the city under the Yuen Dynasty. He
  replied at once with remarkable clearness: “QUEN-ZAN-FU.” Everybody
  present was struck by the exact correspondence of the Chinaman’s
  pronunciation of the name with that which the German traveller had
  adopted from Ritter.

  [The vocabulary _Hweï Hwei_ (Mahomedan) of the College of
  Interpreters at Peking transcribes King chao from the Persian
  Kin-chang, a name it gives to the Shen-si province. King chao was
  called Ngan-si fu in 1277. (_Devéria, Epigraphie_, p. 9.) Ken-jan
  comes from Kin-chang = King-chao = Si-ngan fu.—H. C.]

  Martini speaks, apparently from personal knowledge, of the
  splendour of the city, as regards both its public edifices and
  its site, sloping gradually up from the banks of the River Wei,
  so as to exhibit its walls and palaces at one view like the
  interior of an amphitheatre. West of the city was a sort of
  Water Park, enclosed by a wall 30 _li_ in circumference, full of
  lakes, tanks, and canals from the Wei, and within this park were
  seven fine palaces and a variety of theatres and other places of
  public diversion. To the south-east of the city was an artificial
  lake with palaces, gardens, park, etc., originally formed by the
  Emperor Hiaowu (B.C. 100), and to the south of the city was another
  considerable lake called _Fan_. This may be the Fanchan Lake,
  beside which Rashid says that Ananda, the son of Mangalai, built
  his palace.

  The adjoining districts were the seat of a large Musulman
  population, which in 1861–1862 [and again in 1895 (See _Wellby,
  Tibet_, ch. xxv.)—H. C.] rose in revolt against the Chinese
  authority, and for a time was successful in resisting it. The
  capital itself held out, though invested for two years; the rebels
  having no artillery. The movement originated at Hwachau, some 60
  miles east of Si-ngan fu, now totally destroyed. But the chief seat
  of the Mahomedans is a place which they call _Salar_, identified
  with Hochau in Kansuh, about 70 miles south-west of Lanchau-fu, the
  capital of that province. [Mr. Rockhill (_Land of the Lamas_, p.
  40) writes: “Colonel Yule, quoting a Russian work, has it that the
  word Salar is used to designate Ho-chou, but this is not absolutely
  accurate. Prjevalsky (_Mongolia_, II. 149) makes the following
  complicated statement: ‘The Karatangutans outnumber the Mongols
  in Koko-nor, but their chief habitations are near the sources of
  the Yellow River, where they are called Salirs; they profess the
  Mohammedan religion, and have rebelled against China.’ I will
  only remark here that the Salar have absolutely no connection
  with the so-called Kara-tangutans, who are Tibetans. In a note by
  Archimandrite Palladius, in the same work (II. 70), he attempts to
  show a connection between the Salar and a colony of Mohammedans
  who settled in Western Kan-Suh in the last century, but the _Ming
  shih_ (History of the Ming Dynasty) already makes mention of the
  Salar, remnants of various Turkish tribes (_Hsi-ch’iang_) who had
  settled in the districts of Ho-chou, Huang-chou, T’ao-chou, and
  Min-chou, and who were a source of endless trouble to the Empire.
  (See _Wei Yuen, Sheng-wu-ki_, vii. 35; also _Huang ch’ing shih kung
  t’u_, v. 7.) The Russian traveller, Potanin, found the Salar living
  in twenty-four villages, near Hsün-hua t’ing, on the south bank
  of the Yellow River. (See _Proc. R. G. S._ ix. 234.) The Annals
  of the Ming Dynasty (_Ming Shíh_, ch. 330) say that An-ting wei,
  1500 _li_ south-west of Kan-chou, was in old times known as _Sa-li
  Wei-wu-ehr_. These Sari Uigurs are mentioned by Du Plan Carpin, as
  _Sari_ Huiur. Can _Sala_ be the same as _Sari_?”

  “Mohammedans,” says Mr. Rockhill (_Ibid._ p. 39), “here are divided
  into two sects, known as ‘white-capped Hui-hui,’ and ‘black-capped
  Hui-hui.’ One of the questions which separate them is the hour at
  which fast can be broken during the Ramadan. Another point which
  divides them is that the white-capped burn incense, as do the
  ordinary Chinese; and the Salar condemn this as Paganish. The usual
  way by which one finds out to which sect a Mohammedan belongs is
  by asking him if he burns incense. The black-capped Hui-hui are
  more frequently called _Salar_, and are much the more devout and
  fanatical. They live in the vicinity of Ho-chou, in and around
  Hsün-hua t’ing, their chief town being known as Salar Pakun or
  Paken.”

  Ho-chou, in Western Kan-Suh, about 320 _li_ (107 miles) from
  Lan-chau, has a population of about 30,000 nearly entirely
  Mahomedans with 24 mosques; it is a “hot-bed of rebellion.”
  _Salar-pa-kun_ means “the eight thousand Salar families,” or “the
  eight thousands of the Salar.” The eight _kiun_ (Chinese _t’sun_?
  a village, a commune) constituting the Salar pa-kun are Kä-tzŭ,
  the oldest and largest, said to have over 1300 families living
  in it, Chang-chia, Némen, Ch’ing-shui, Munta, Tsu-chi, Antasu
  and Ch’a-chia. Besides these Salar kiun there are five outer
  (_wai_) kiun: Ts’a-pa, Ngan-ssŭ-to, Hei-ch’eng, Kan-tu and Kargan,
  inhabited by a few Salar and a mixed population of Chinese and
  T’u-ssŭ: each of these wai-wu kiun has, theoretically, fifteen
  villages in it. Tradition says that the first Salar who came to
  China (from Rúm or Turkey) arrived in this valley in the third year
  of Hung-wu of the Ming (1370). (_Rockhill, Land of the Lamas,

  NOTE 4.—_Mangalai_, Kúblái’s third son, who governed the provinces
  of Shen-si and Sze-ch’wan, with the title of _Wang_ or king
  (_supra_ ch. ix. note 2), died in 1280, a circumstance which limits
  the date of Polo’s journey to the west. It seems unlikely that
  Marco should have remained ten years ignorant of his death, yet he
  seems to speak of him as still governing.

  [With reference to the translation of the oldest of the
  Chinese-Mongol inscriptions known hitherto (1283) in the name of
  Ananda, King of Ngan-si, Professor Devéria (_Notes d’Épigraphie
  Mongolo-Chinoise_, p. 9) writes: “In 1264, the Emperor Kúbláï
  created in this region [Shen si] the department of Ngan-si chau,
  occupied by ten hordes of Si-fan (foreigners from the west). All
  this country became in 1272, the apanage of the Imperial Prince
  Mangala; this prince, third son of Kúbláï, had been invested with
  the title of King of Ngan-si, a territory which included King-chao
  fu (modern Si-ngan fu). His government extended hence over Ho-si
  (west of the Yellow River), the T’u-po (Tibetans), and Sze-ch’wan.
  The following year (1273) Mangala received from Kúbláï a second
  investiture, this of the Kingdom of Tsin, which added to his domain
  part of Kan-Suh; he established his royal residence at K’ia-ch’eng
  (modern Ku-yuan) in the Liu-p’an shan, while King-chao remained
  the centre of the command he exercised over the Mongol garrisons.
  In 1277 this prince took part in military operations in the north;
  he died in 1280 (17th year Che Yuan), leaving his principality of
  Ngan-si to his eldest son Ananda, and this of Tsin to his second
  son Ngan-tan Bu-hoa. Kúbláï, immediately after the death of his son
  Mangala, suppressed administrative autonomy in Ngan-si.” (_Yuan-shi

[4] In the first edition I was able to present a reduced facsimile of
    a _rubbing_ in my possession from this famous inscription, which I
    owed to the generosity of Dr. Lockhart. To the Baron von Richthofen
    I am no less indebted for the more complete rubbing which has
    afforded the plate now published. A tolerably full account of this
    inscription is given in _Cathay_, p. xcii. _seqq._, and p. clxxxi.
    _seqq._, but the subject is so interesting that it seems well to
    introduce here the most important particulars:—

    The stone slab, about 7½ feet high by 3 feet wide, and some
    10 inches in thickness,[A] which bears this inscription, was
    accidentally found in 1625 by some workmen who were digging in
    the Chang-ngan suburb of the city of Singanfu. The cross, which
    is engraved at p. 30, is incised at the top of the slab, and
    beneath this are 9 large characters in 3 columns, constituting the
    heading, which runs: “_Monument commemorating the introduction and
    propagation of the noble Law of_ Ta T’sin _in the Middle Kingdom;_”
    _Ta T’sin_ being the term applied in Chinese literature to the
    Roman Empire, of which the ancient Chinese had much such a shadowy
    conception as the Romans had, conversely, of the Chinese as _Sinae_
    and _Seres_. Then follows the body of the inscription, of great
    length and beautiful execution, consisting of 1780 characters.
    Its chief contents are as follows:— 1st. An abstract of Christian
    doctrine, of a vague and figurative kind; 2nd. An account of
    the arrival of the missionary OLOPĂN (probably a Chinese form
    of _Rabban_ = Monk),[B] from Ta T’sin in the year equivalent to
    A.D. 635, bringing sacred books and images; of the _translation
    of the said books_; of the Imperial approval of the doctrine
    and permission to teach it publicly. There follows a decree of
    the Emperor (T’ai Tsung, a very famous prince) issued in 638, in
    favour of the new doctrine, and ordering a church to be built in
    the Square of Peace and Justice (_I-ning Fang_), at the capital.
    The Emperor’s portrait was to be placed in the church. After this
    comes a description of Ta T’sin (here apparently implying Syria);
    and then some account of the fortunes of the Church in China. Kao
    Tsung (650–683, the devout patron also of the Buddhist traveller and
    Dr. Hiuen Tsang) continued to favour it. In the end of the century,
    Buddhism gets the upper hand, but under HIUAN-TSUNG (713–755) the
    Church recovers its prestige, and KIHO, a new missionary, arrives.
    Under TE-TSUNG (780–783) the monument was erected, and this part
    ends with the eulogy of ISSÉ, a statesman and benefactor of the
    Church. 3rd. There follows a recapitulation of the purport in
    octosyllabic verse.

    The Chinese inscription concludes with the date of erection, viz.
    the second year _Kienchung_ of the Great T’ang Dynasty, the seventh
    day of the month _Tait’su_, the feast of the great _Yaosan_.
    This corresponds, according to Gaubil, to 4th February, 781; and
    _Yaosan_ is supposed to stand for _Hosanna_ (_i.e._ Palm Sunday;
    but this apparently does not fit; see _infra_). There are added the
    name chief of the law, NINGCHU (presumed to be the Chinese name
    of the Metropolitan), the name of the writer, and the official
    sanction.

    The _Great Hosanna_ was, though ingenious, a misinterpretation
    of Gaubil’s. Mr. Wylie has sent me a paper of his own (in _Chin.
    Recorder and Miss. Journal_, July, 1871, p. 45), which makes
    things perfectly clear. The expression transcribed by Pauthier,
    _Yao-săn-wen_, and rendered “Hosanna,” appears in a Chinese work,
    without reference to this inscription, as _Yao-săn-wăh_, and is in
    reality only a Chinese transcript of the Persian word for Sunday,
    “_Yak-shambah_.” Mr. Wylie verified this from the mouth of a Peking
    Mahomedan. The 4th of February, 781 _was_ Sunday; why _Great_
    Sunday? Mr. Wylie suggests, possibly because the first Sunday of
    the (Chinese) year.

    The monument exhibits, in addition to the Chinese text, a series
    of short inscriptions in the Syriac language, and _Estranghelo_
    character, containing the date of erection, viz. 1092 of the Greeks
    (= A.D. 781), the name of the reigning Patriarch of the Nestorian
    church MAR HANAN ISHUA (dead in 778, but the fact apparently had
    not reached China), that of ADAM, Bishop and Pope of Tzinisthán
    (_i.e._ China), and those of the clerical staff of the capital
    which here bears the name, given it by the early Arab Travellers,
    of _Kúmdán_. There follow sixty-seven names of persons in Syriac
    characters, most of whom are characterised as priests (_Kashíshá_),
    and sixty-one names of persons in Chinese, all priests save one.

    [It appears that Adam (_King-tsing_), who erected the monument
    under Te-Tsung was, under the same Emperor, with a Buddhist the
    translator of a Buddhist sûtra, the Saṭpâramitâ from a Hu text.
    (See a curious paper by Mr. J. Takakusu in the _T’oung Pao_, VII
    pp. 589–591.)

    Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, p. 157, _note_) makes the following
    remarks. “It is strange, however, that the two famous Uigur
    Nestorians, Mar Jabalaha and Rabban Cauma, when on their journey
    from Koshang in Southern Shan-hsi to Western Asia in about 1276,
    while they mention ‘the city of Tangut,’ or Ning-hsia on the Yellow
    River as an important Nestorian centre, do not once refer to
    Hsi-anfu or Chang-an. Had Chang-an been at the time the Nestorian
    Episcopal see, one would think that these pilgrims would have
    visited it, or at least referred to it. (_Chabot, Mar Jabalaha_,
    21)”—H. C.]

    Kircher gives a good many more Syriac names than appear on the
    rubbing, probably because some of these are on the edge of the slab
    now built in. We have no room to speak of the controversies raised
    by this stone. The most able defence of its genuine character,
    as well as a transcript with translation and commentary, a work
    of great interest, was published by the late M. Pauthier. The
    monument exists intact, and has been visited by the Rev. Mr.
    Williamson, Baron Richthofen, and other recent travellers. [The
    Rev. Moir Duncan wrote from Shen-si regarding the present state
    of the stone. (_London and China Telegraph_, 5th June, 1893): “Of
    the covering rebuilt so recently, not a trace remains save the
    pedestals for the pillars and atoms of the tiling. In answer to a
    question as to when and how the covering was destroyed, the old
    priest replied, with a twinkle in his eye as if his conscience
    pinched, ‘There came a rushing wind and blew it down.’ He could
    not say when, for he paid no attention to such mundane affairs.
    More than one outsider however, said it had been deliberately
    destroyed, because the priests are jealous of the interest
    manifested in it.... The stone has evidently been recently tampered
    with, several characters are effaced and there are other signs of
    malicious hands.”—H. C.] Pauthier’s works on the subject are—_De
    l’Authenticité de l’Inscription Nestorienne_, etc., B. Duprat,
    1857; and _l’Inscription Syro-Chinoise de Si-ngan-fou_, etc.,
    Firmin Didot, 1858. (See also _Kircher, China Illustrata_; and
    article by Mr. Wylie in _J. Am. Or. Soc._, V. 278.) [Father Havret,
    S.J., of Zi-ka-wei, near Shang-hai, has undertaken to write a large
    work on this inscription with the title of _La Stèle Chrétienne de
    Si-ngan-fou_; the first part giving the inscription in full size,
    and the second containing the history of the monument, have been
    published at Shang-hai in 1895 and 1897; the author died last year
    (29th September, 1901), and the translation which was to form a
    third part has not yet appeared. The Rev. Dr. J. Legge has given a
    translation and the Chinese text of the monument, in 1888.—H. C.]

    Stone monuments of character strictly analogous are frequent in
    the precincts of Buddhist sanctuaries, and probably the idea of
    this one was taken from the Buddhists. It is reasonably supposed
    by Pauthier that the monument may have been buried in 845, when
    the Emperor Wu-Tsung issued an edict, still extant, against the
    vast multiplication of Buddhist convents, and ordering their
    destruction. A clause in the edict also orders the _foreign bonzes
    of Ta-T’sin_ and _Mubupa_ (Christian and _Mobed_ or Magian?) _to
    return to secular life_.

[B] [Dr. F. Hirth (_China and the Roman Orient_, p. 323) writes:
    “O-LO-PÊN = Ruben, Rupen?” He adds (_Jour. China Br. R. As. Soc._
    XXI. 1886, pp. 214–215): “Initial _r_ is also quite commonly
    represented by initial _l_. I am in doubt whether the two
    characters _o-lo_ in the Chinese name for Russia (_O-lo-ssŭ_) stand
    for foreign _ru_ or _ro_ alone. This word would bear comparison
    with a Chinese transcription of the Sanskrit word for silver,
    _rūpya_, which in the _Pen-ts’ao-kang-mu_ (ch. 8, p. 9) is given
    as _o-lu-pa_. If we can find further analogies, this may help us
    to read that mysterious word in the Nestorian stone inscription,
    being the name of the first Christian missionary who carried the
    cross to China, _O-lo-pên_, as ‘Ruben’. This was indeed a common
    name among the Nestorians, for which reason I would give it the
    preference over Pauthier’s Syriac ‘Alopeno’. But Father Havret
    (_Stèle Chrétienne_, Leide, 1897, p. 26) objects to Dr. Hirth that
    the Chinese character _lo_, to which he gives the sound _ru_,
    is not to be found as a Sanskrit phonetic element in Chinese
    characters, but that this phonetic element _ru_ is represented by
    the Chinese characters pronounced _lu_, and therefore, he, Father
    Havret, adopts Colonel Yule’s opinion as the only one being fully
    satisfactory.”—H. C.]




                             CHAPTER XLII.

    CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF CUNCUN, WHICH IS RIGHT WEARISOME TO
                            TRAVEL THROUGH.


On leaving the Palace of Mangalai, you travel westward for three days,
finding a succession of cities and boroughs and beautiful plains,
inhabited by people who live by trade and industry, and have great
plenty of silk. At the end of those three days, you reach the great
mountains and valleys which belong to the province of CUNCUN.{1} There
are towns and villages in the land, and the people live by tilling the
earth, and by hunting in the great woods; for the region abounds in
forests, wherein are many wild beasts, such as lions, bears, lynxes,
bucks and roes, and sundry other kinds, so that many are taken by
the people of the country, who make a great profit thereof. So this
way we travel over mountains and valleys, finding a succession of
towns and villages, and many great hostelries for the entertainment of
travellers, interspersed among extensive forests.


  NOTE 1.—The region intended must necessarily be some part of the
  southern district of the province of Shen-si, called HAN-CHUNG,
  the axis of which is the River Han, closed in by exceedingly
  mountainous and woody country to north and south, dividing it on
  the former quarter from the rest of Shen-si, and on the latter from
  Sze-ch’wan. Polo’s _C_ frequently expresses an _H_, especially the
  Guttural _H_ of Chinese names, yet _Cuncun_ is not satisfactory as
  the expression of _Hanchung_.

  The country was so ragged that in ancient times travellers from
  Si-ngan fu had to make a long circuit eastward by the frontier of
  Ho-nan to reach Han-chung; but, at an early date, a road was made
  across the mountains for military purposes; so long ago indeed that
  various eras and constructors are assigned to it. Padre Martini’s
  authorities ascribed it to a general in the service of Liu Pang,
  the founder of the first Han Dynasty (B.C. 202), and this date
  is current in Shan-si, as Baron v. Richthofen tells me. But in
  Sze-ch’wan the work is asserted to have been executed during the
  3rd century, when China was divided into several states, by Liu
  Pei, of the Han family, who, about A.D. 226, established himself
  as Emperor [Minor Han] of Western China at Ch’êng-tu fu.[1] This
  work, with its difficulties and boldness, extending often for
  great distances on timber corbels inserted in the rock, is vividly
  described by Martini. Villages and rest-houses were established
  at convenient distances. It received from the Chinese the name of
  _Chien-tao_, or the “Pillar Road.” It commenced on the west bank
  of the Wei, opposite Pao-ki h’ien, 100 miles west of Si-ngan fu,
  and ended near the town of Paoching-h’ien, some 15 or 20 miles
  north-west from Han-chung.

  We are told that Tului, the son of Chinghiz, when directing his
  march against Ho-nan in 1231 by this very line from Paoki, had
  to _make_ a road with great difficulty; but, as we shall see
  presently, this can only mean that the ancient road had fallen
  into decay, and had to be repaired. The same route was followed
  by Okkodai’s son Kutan, in marching to attack the Sung Empire in
  1235, and again by Mangku Kaan on his last campaign in 1258. These
  circumstances show that the road from Paoki was in that age the
  usual route into Han-chung and Sze-ch’wan; indeed there is no other
  road in that direction that is more than a mere jungle-track, and
  we may be certain that this was Polo’s route.

  This remarkable road was traversed by Baron v. Richthofen in
  1872. To my questions, he replies: “The entire route is a work
  of tremendous engineering, and all of this was done by Liu Pei,
  who first ordered the construction. The hardest work consisted in
  cutting out long portions of the road from solid rock, chiefly
  where ledges project on the verge of a river, as is frequently the
  case on the He-lung Kiang.... It had been done so thoroughly from
  the first, that scarcely any additions had to be made in after
  days. Another kind of work which generally strikes tourists like
  Father Martini, or Chinese travellers, is the poling up of the road
  on the sides of steep cliffs[2].... Extensive cliffs are frequently
  rounded in this way, and imagination is much struck with the
  perils of walking on the side of a precipice, with the foaming
  river below. When the timbers rot, such passages of course become
  obstructed, and thus the road is said to have been periodically
  in complete disuse. The repairs, which were chiefly made in the
  time of the Ming, concerned especially passages of this sort.”
  Richthofen also notices the abundance of game; but inhabited places

[1] The last is also stated by Klaproth. Ritter has overlooked the
    discrepancy of the dates (B.C. and A.D.) and has supposed Liu Pei
    and Liu Pang to be the same. The resemblance of the names, and the
    fact that both princes were founders of Han Dynasties, give ample
    room for confusion.

                            CHAPTER XLIII.

               CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF ACBALEC MANZI.


After you have travelled those 20 days through the mountains of CUNCUN
that I have mentioned, then you come to a province called ACBALEC
MANZI, which is all level country, with plenty of towns and villages,
and belongs to the Great Kaan. The people are Idolaters, and live
by trade and industry. I may tell you that in this province, there
grows such a great quantity of ginger, that it is carried all over
the region of Cathay, and it affords a maintenance to all the people
of the province, who get great gain thereby. They have also wheat
and rice, and other kinds of corn, in great plenty and cheapness; in
fact the country abounds in all useful products. The capital city is
called ACBALEC MANZI [which signifies “the White City of the Manzi
Frontier”].{1}

This plain extends for two days’ journey, throughout which it is
as fine as I have told you, with towns and villages as numerous.
After those two days, you again come to great mountains and valleys,
and extensive forests, and you continue to travel westward through
this kind of country for 20 days, finding however numerous towns
and villages. The people are Idolaters, and live by agriculture, by
cattle-keeping, and by the chase, for there is much game. And among
other kinds, there are the animals that produce the musk, in great
numbers.{2}


  NOTE 1.—Though the termini of the route, described in these two
  chapters, are undoubtedly Si-ngan fu and Ch’êng-tu fu, there are
  serious difficulties attending the determination of the line
  actually followed.

  The time according to all the MSS., so far as I know, except those
  of one type, is as follows:

      In the plain of Kenjanfu                 3 days.
      In the mountains of Cuncun              20  „
      In the plain of Acbalec                  2  „
      In mountains again                      20  „
                                              ——
                                              45 days.
                                              ——

  [From Si-ngan fu to Ch’êng-tu (Sze-ch’wan), the Chinese reckon
  2300 _li_ (766 miles). (Cf. _Rockhill, Land of the Lamas_, p. 23.)
  Mr. G. F. Eaton, writing from Han-chung (_Jour. China Br. R. A.
  S._ xxviii. p. 29) reckons: “From Si-ngan Fu S.W. to Ch’êng-tu,
  _viâ_ K’i-shan, Fung-sien, Mien, Kwang-yuan and Chao-hwa, about 30
  days, in chairs.” He says (p. 24): “From Ch’êng-tu _viâ_ Si-ngan
  to Peking the road does not touch Han-chung, but 20 _li_ west of
  the city strikes north to Pao-ch’eng.—The road from Han-chung to
  Ch’êng-tu made by Ts’in Shi Hwang-ti to secure his conquest of
  Sze-ch’wan, crosses the Ta-pa-shan.”—H. C.]

  It seems to me almost impossible to doubt that the Plain of
  Acbalec represents some part of the river-valley of the Han,
  interposed between the two ranges of mountains called by Richthofen
  _T’sing-Ling-Shan_ and _Ta-pa-Shan_. But the time, as just stated,
  is extravagant for anything like a direct journey between the two
  termini.

  The distance from Si-ngan fu to Pao-ki is 450 _li_, which _could_
  be done in 3 days, but at Polo’s rate would probably require 5.
  The distance by the mountain road from Pao-ki to the Plain of
  Han-chung, could never have occupied 20 days. It is really a 6 or 7
  days’ march.

  But Pauthier’s MS. C (and its double, the Bern MS.) has viii.
  marches instead of xx., through the mountains of Cuncun. This
  reduces the time between Kenjanfu and the Plain to 11 days, which
  is just about a proper allowance for the whole journey, though
  not accurately distributed. Two days, though ample, would not be
  excessive for the journey across the Plain of Han-chung, especially
  if the traveller visited that city. And “20 days from Han-chung, to
  Ch’êng-tu fu would correspond with Marco Polo’s rate of travel.”
  (_Richthofen_).

  So far then, provided we admit the reading of the MS. C, there is
  no ground for hesitating to adopt the usual route between the two
  cities, _viâ_ Han-chung.

  But the key to the exact route is evidently the position of Acbalec
  Manzi, and on this there is no satisfactory light.

  For the name of the province, Pauthier’s text has _Acbalec Manzi_,
  for the name of the city _Acmalec_ simply. The G. T. has in the
  former case _Acbalec Mangi_, in the latter “Acmelic Mangi _qe vaut
  dire_ le une _de le confine dou Mangi_.” This is followed literally
  by the Geographic Latin, which has “_Acbalec Mangi et est dictum
  in lingua nostra_ unus _ex confinibus Mangi_.” So also the Crusca;
  whilst Ramusio has “_Achbaluch Mangi, che vuol dire_ Città Bianca
  de’ confini di Mangi.” It is clear that Ramusio alone has here
  preserved the genuine reading.

  Klaproth identified Acbalec conjecturally with the town of
  _Pe-ma-ching_, or “White-Horse-Town,” a place now extinct, but
  which stood like Mien and Han-chung on the extensive and populous
  Plain that here borders the Han.

  It seems so likely that the latter part of the name _Pe_-MACHING
  (“_White_ Maching”) might have been confounded by foreigners with
  _Máchín_ and _Manzi_ (which in Persian parlance were identical),
  that I should be disposed to overlook the difficulty that we have
  no evidence produced to show that Pemaching was a place of any
  consequence.

  It is possible, however, that the name _Acbalec_ may have been
  given by the Tartars without any reference to Chinese etymologies.
  We have already twice met with the name or its equivalent
  (_Acbaluc_ in ch. xxxvii. of this Book, and _Chaghan Balghasun_ in
  note 3 to Book I. ch. lx.), whilst Strahlenberg tells us that the
  Tartars call all great residences of princes by this name (Amst.
  ed. 1757, I. p. 7). It may be that Han-chung itself was so named
  by the Tartars; though its only claim that I can find is, that it
  was the first residence of the Han Dynasty. Han-chung fu stands
  in a beautiful plain, which forms a very striking object to the
  traveller who is leaving the T’sing-ling mountains. Just before
  entering the plains, the Helung Kiang passes through one of its
  wildest gorges, a mere crevice between vertical walls several
  hundred feet high. The road winds to the top of one of the cliffs
  in zigzags cut in the solid rock. From the temple of Kitau Kwan,
  which stands at the top of the cliff, there is a magnificent view
  of the Plain, and no traveller would omit this, the most notable
  feature between the valley of the Wei and Ch’êng-tu-fu. It is,
  moreover, the only piece of level ground, of any extent, that is
  passed through between those two regions, whichever road or track
  be taken. (_Richthofen_, MS. Notes.)

  [In the _China Review_ (xiv. p. 358) Mr. E. H. Parker, has an
  article on _Acbalec Manzi_, but does not throw any new light on the
  subject.—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—Polo’s journey now continues through the lofty mountainous
  region in the north of Sze-ch’wan.

  The dividing range Ta-pa-shan is less in height than the
  T’sing-ling range, but with gorges still more abrupt and deep; and
  it would be an entire barrier to communication but for the care
  with which the road, here also, has been formed. But this road,
  from Han-chung to Ch’êng-tu fu, is still older than that to the
  north, having been constructed, it is said, in the 3rd century B.C.
  [See _supra_.] Before that time Sze-ch’wan was a closed country,
  the only access from the north being the circuitous route down the
  Han and up the Yang-tz’ŭ. (_Ibid._)

  [Mr. G. G. Brown writes (_Jour. China Br. R. As. Soc._ xxviii.
  p. 53): “Crossing the Ta-pa-shan from the valley of the Upper
  Han in Shen-si we enter the province of Sze-ch’wan, and are now
  in a country as distinct as possible from that that has been
  left. The climate which in the north was at times almost Arctic,
  is now pluvial, and except on the summits of the mountains no
  snow is to be seen. The people are ethnologically different....
  More even than the change of climate the geological aspect is
  markedly different. The loess, which in Shen-si has settled like
  a pall over the country, is here absent, and red sandstone rocks,
  filling the valleys between the high-bounding and intermediate
  ridges of palæozoic formation, take its place. Sze-ch’wan is
  evidently a region of rivers flowing in deeply eroded valleys,
  and as these find but one exit, the deep gorges of Kwei-fu,
  their disposition takes the form of the innervations of a leaf
  springing from a solitary stalk. The country between the branching
  valleys is eminently hilly; the rivers flow with rapid currents
  in well-defined valleys, and are for the most part navigable
  for boats, or in their upper reaches for lumber-rafts.... The
  horse-cart, which in the north and north-west of China is the
  principal means of conveyance, has never succeeded in gaining
  an entrance into Sze-ch’wan with its steep ascents and rapid
  unfordable streams; and is here represented for passenger traffic
  by the sedan-chair, and for the carriage of goods, with the
  exception of a limited number of wheel-barrows, by the backs of
  men or animals, unless where the friendly water-courses afford the
  cheapest and readiest means of intercourse.”—H. C.]

  Martini notes the musk-deer in northern Sze-ch’wan.




                             CHAPTER XLIV.

             CONCERNING THE PROVINCE AND CITY OF SINDAFU.


When you have travelled those 20 days westward through the mountains,
as I have told you, then you arrive at a plain belonging to a province
called Sindafu, which still is on the confines of Manzi, and the
capital city of which is (also) called SINDAFU. This city was in former
days a rich and noble one, and the Kings who reigned there were very
great and wealthy. It is a good twenty miles in compass, but it is
divided in the way that I shall tell you.

You see the King of this Province, in the days of old, when he found
himself drawing near to death, leaving three sons behind him, commanded
that the city should be divided into three parts, and that each of his
three sons should have one. So each of these three parts is separately
walled about, though all three are surrounded by the common wall of the
city. Each of the three sons was King, having his own part of the city,
and his own share of the kingdom, and each of them in fact was a great
and wealthy King. But the Great Kaan conquered the kingdom of these
three Kings, and stripped them of their inheritance.{1}

Through the midst of this great city runs a large river, in which they
catch a great quantity of fish. It is a good half mile wide, and very
deep withal, and so long that it reaches all the way to the Ocean
Sea,—a very long way, equal to 80 or 100 days’ journey. And the name
of the River is KIAN-SUY. The multitude of vessels that navigate this
river is so vast, that no one who should read or hear the tale would
believe it. The quantities of merchandize also which merchants carry
up and down this river are past all belief. In fact, it is so big, that
it seems to be a Sea rather than a River!{2}

Let us now speak of a great Bridge which crosses this River within the
city. This bridge is of stone; it is seven paces in width and half a
mile in length (the river being that much in width as I told you); and
all along its length on either side there are columns of marble to bear
the roof, for the bridge is roofed over from end to end with timber,
and that all richly painted. And on this bridge there are houses in
which a great deal of trade and industry is carried on. But these
houses are all of wood merely, and they are put up in the morning and
taken down in the evening. Also there stands upon the bridge the Great
Kaan’s _Comercque_, that is to say, his custom-house, where his toll
and tax are levied.{3} And I can tell you that the dues taken on this
bridge bring to the Lord a thousand pieces of fine gold every day and
more. The people are all Idolaters.{4}

When you leave this city you travel for five days across a country of
plains and valleys, finding plenty of villages and hamlets, and the
people of which live by husbandry. There are numbers of wild beasts,
lions, and bears, and such like.

I should have mentioned that the people of Sindu itself live by
manufactures, for they make fine sendals and other stuffs.{5}

After travelling those five days’ march, you reach a province called
Tebet, which has been sadly laid waste; we will now say something of it.


  NOTE 1.—We are on firm ground again, for SINDAFU is certainly
  CH’ÊNG-TU FU, the capital of Sze-ch’wan. Probably the name used by
  Polo was _Sindu-fu_, as we find _Sindu_ in the G. T. near the end
  of the chapter. But the same city is, I observe, called _Thindafu_
  by one of the Nepalese embassies, whose itineraries Mr. Hodgson has
  given in the _J. A. S. B._ XXV. 488.

      A. The Great City.
      B. The Little City.
      C. The Imperial City.

  The modern French missions have a bishop in Ch’êng-tu fu, and the
  city has been visited of late years by Mr. T. T. Cooper, by Mr. A.
  Wylie, by Baron v. Richthofen, [Captain Gill, Mr. Baber, Mr. Hosie,
  and several other travellers]. Mr. Wylie has kindly favoured me
  with the following note:—“My notice all goes to corroborate Marco
  Polo. The covered bridge with the stalls is still there, the only
  difference being the absence of the toll-house. I did not see any
  traces of a tripartite division of the city, nor did I make any
  enquiries on the subject during the 3 or 4 days I spent there, as
  it was not an object with me at the time to verify Polo’s account.
  The city is indeed divided, but the division dates more than a
  thousand years back. It is something like this, I should say [see
  diagram].[1]

  “The Imperial City (_Hwang Ching_) was the residence of the
  monarch Lew Pé (_i.e._ Liu Pei of p. 32) during the short period
  of the ‘Three Kingdoms’ (3rd century), and some relics of the
  ancient edifice still remain. I was much interested in looking
  over it. It is now occupied by the Public Examination Hall and its
  dependencies.”

  I suspect Marco’s story of the Three Kings arose from a
  misunderstanding about this historical period of the _San-Kwé_, or
  Three Kingdoms (A.D. 222–264). And this tripartite division of the
  city may have been merely that which we see to exist at present.

  [Mr. Baber, leaving Ch’êng-tu, 26th July, 1877, writes (_Travels_,
  p. 28): “We took ship outside the East Gate on a rapid narrow
  stream, apparently the city moat, which soon joins the main river,
  a little below the An-shun Bridge, an antiquated wooden structure
  some 90 yards long. This is in all probability the bridge mentioned
  by Marco Polo. The too flattering description he gives of it leads
  one to suppose that the present handsome stone bridges of the
  province were unbuilt at the time of his journey.” Baber is here
  mistaken.

  Captain Gill writes (_l.c._ II. p. 9): “As Mr. Wylie in recent days
  had said that Polo’s covered bridge was still in its place, we went
  one day on an expedition in search of it. Polo, however, speaks of
  a bridge full half a mile long, whilst the longest now is but 90
  yards. On our way we passed over a fine nine-arched stone bridge,
  called the Chin-Yen-Ch’iao. Near the covered bridge there is a very
  pretty view down the river.”—H. C.]

  Baron Richthofen observes that Ch’êng-tu is among the largest of
  Chinese cities, and is of all the finest and most refined. The
  population is called 800,000. The walls form a square of about 3
  miles to the side, and there are suburbs besides. The streets are
  broad and straight, laid out at right angles, with a pavement of
  square flags very perfectly laid, slightly convex and drained at
  each side. The numerous commemorative arches are sculptured with
  skill; there is much display of artistic taste; and the people
  are remarkably civil to foreigners. This characterizes the whole
  province; and an air of wealth and refinement prevails even in the
  rural districts. The plain round Ch’êng-tu fu is about 90 miles
  in length (S.E. to N.W.), by 40 miles in width, with a copious
  irrigation and great fertility, so that in wealth and population it
  stands almost unrivalled. (_Letter_ VII. pp. 48–66.)

  [Illustration: PLAN OF CHENG-TU.

    _Églises ou Établissements français des “Missions étrangères”_

    _Reproduction d’une carte chinoise_]

  [Mr. Baber (_Travels_, p. 26) gives the following information
  regarding the population of Ch’êng-tu: “The census of 1877 returned
  the number of families at about 70,000, and the total population
  at 330,000—190,000 being males and 140,000 females; but probably
  the extensive suburb was not included in the enumeration. Perhaps
  350,000 would be a fair total estimate.” It is the seat of the
  Viceroy of the Sze-ch’wan province. Mr. Hosie says (_Three Years in
  Western China_, p. 86): “It is without exception the finest city I
  have seen in China; Peking and Canton will not bear comparison with
  it.” Captain Gill writes (_River of Golden Sand_, II. p. 4): “The
  city of Ch’êng-Tu is still a rich and noble one, somewhat irregular
  in shape, and surrounded by a strong wall, in a perfect state of
  repair. In this there are eight bastions, four being pierced by
  gates.”

  “It is one of the largest of Chinese cities, having a circuit of
  about 12 miles.” (_Baber_, p. 26.) “It is now three and a half
  miles long by about two and a half miles broad, the longest side
  lying about east-south-east, and west-north-west, so that its
  compass in the present day is about 12 miles.” (_Captain Gill_, II.
  p. 4.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—Ramusio is more particular: “Through the city flow many
  great rivers, which come down from distant mountains, and run
  winding about through many parts of the city. These rivers vary in
  width from half a mile to 200 paces, and are very deep. Across them
  are built many bridges of stone,” etc. “And after passing the city
  these rivers unite and form one immense river called Kian,” etc.
  Here we have the Great River or KIANG, Kian (Quian) as in Ramusio,
  or KIANG-SHUI, “Waters of the Kiang,” as in the text. So Pauthier
  explains. [Mr. Baber remarks at Ch’êng-tu (_Travels_, p. 28): “When
  all allowance is made for the diminution of the river, one cannot
  help surmising that Marco Polo must have felt reluctant to call it
  the _Chiang-Sui_ or ‘Yangtzŭ waterway.’ He was, however, correct
  enough, as usual, for the Chinese consider it to be the main upper
  stream of the Yangtzŭ.”—H. C.] Though our Geographies give the
  specific names of Wen and Min to the great branch which flows by
  Ch’êng-tu fu, and treat the Tibetan branch which flows through
  northern Yunnan under the name of Kin sha or “Golden Sand,” as the
  main river, the Chinese seem always to have regarded the former as
  the true Kiang; as may be seen in Ritter (IV. 650) and Martini. The
  latter describes the city as quite insulated by the ramifications
  of the river, from which channels and canals pass all about it,
  adorned with many quays and bridges of stone.

  The numerous channels in reuniting form two rivers, one the Min,
  and the other the To-Kiang, which also joins the Yangtzŭ at Lu-chau.

  [In his _Introductory Essay to Captain Gill’s River of Golden
  Sand_, Colonel Yule (p. 37) writes: “Captain Gill has pointed out
  that, of the many branches of the river which ramify through the
  plain of Ch’êng-tu, no one now passes through the city at all
  corresponding in magnitude to that which Marco Polo describes,
  about 1283, as running through the midst of Sin-da-fu, ‘a good
  half-mile wide, and very deep withal.’ The largest branch adjoining
  the city now runs on the south side, but does not exceed a hundred
  yards in width; and though it is crossed by a covered bridge with
  huxters’ booths, more or less in the style described by Polo, it
  necessarily falls far short of his great bridge of half a mile
  in length. Captain Gill suggests that a change may have taken
  place in the last five (this should be _six_) centuries, owing to
  the deepening of the river-bed at its exit from the plain, and
  consequent draining of the latter. But I should think it more
  probable that the ramification of channels round Ch’êng-tu, which
  is so conspicuous even on a small general map of China, like that
  which accompanies this work, is in great part due to art; that
  the mass of the river has been drawn off to irrigate the plain;
  and that thus the wide river, which in the 13th century may have
  passed through the city, no unworthy representative of the mighty
  Kiang, has long since ceased, on that scale, to flow. And I have
  pointed out briefly that the fact, which Baron Richthofen attests,
  of an actual bifurcation of waters on a large scale taking place
  in the plain of Ch’êng-tu—one arm ‘branching east to form the To’
  (as in the terse indication of the Yü-Kung)—viz. the To Kiang or
  Chung-Kiang flowing south-east to join the great river at Lu-chau,
  whilst another flows south to Sü-chau or Swi-fu, does render
  change in the distribution of the waters about the city highly
  credible.”] [See _Irrigation of the Ch’eng-tu Plain_, by _Joshua
  Vale_, China Inland Mission in _Jour. China Br. R. A. S. Soc._
  XXXIII. 1899–1900, pp. 22–36.—H. C.]

  [Above Kwan Hsien, near Ch’êng-tu, there is a fine suspension
  bridge, mentioned by Marcel Monnier (_Itinéraires_, p. 43), from
  whom I borrow the cut reproduced on this page. This bridge is also
  spoken of by Captain Gill (_l.c._ I. p. 335): “Six ropes, one above
  the other, are stretched very tightly, and connected by vertical
  battens of wood laced in and out. Another similar set of ropes is
  at the other side of the roadway, which is laid across these, and
  follows the curve of the ropes. There are three or four spans with
  stone piers.”—H. C.]

  [Illustration: Bridge near Kwan-hsien (Ch’êng-tu).]

  NOTE 3.—(G. T.) “_Hi est le_ couiereque _dou Grant Sire, ce est
  cilz qe recevent la rente dou Seignor_.” Pauthier has _couvert_.
  Both are, I doubt not, misreadings or misunderstandings of
  _comercque_ or _comerc_. This word, founded on the Latin
  _commercium_, was widely spread over the East with the meaning
  of _customs-duty_ or _custom-house_. In Low Greek it appeared as
  κομμέρκιον and κουμέρκιον, now κομέρκι; in Arabic and Turkish as
  قمرق and كمرك (_ḳumruḳ_ and _gyumruk_), still in use; in Romance
  dialects as _comerchio, comerho, comergio_, etc.

  NOTE 4.—The word in Pauthier’s text which I have rendered _pieces_
  of gold is _pois_, probably equivalent to _saggi_ or _misḳáls_.[2]
  The G. T. has “is well worth 1000 _bezants_ of gold,” no doubt
  meaning _daily_, though not saying so. Ramusio has “100 bezants
  daily.” The term Bezant may be taken as synonymous with _Dínár_,
  and the statement in the text would make the daily receipt of
  custom upwards of 500_l._, that in Ramusio upwards of 50_l._ only.

  NOTE 5.—I have recast this passage, which has got muddled, probably
  in the original dictation, for it runs in the G. text: “Et de ceste
  cité se part l’en et chevauche cinq jornée por plain et por valée,
  et treve-l’en castiaus et casaus assez. Les homes vivent dou profit
  qu’il traient de la terre. Il hi a bestes sauvajes assez, lions et
  orses et autres bestes. _Il vivent d’ars: car il hi se laborent des
  biaus sendal et autres dras. Il sunt de Sindu meisme._” I take it
  that in speaking of Ch’êng-tu fu, Marco has forgotten to fill up
  his usual formula as to the occupation of the inhabitants; he is
  reminded of this when he speaks of the occupation of the peasantry
  on the way to Tibet, and reverts to the citizens in the words which
  I have quoted in Italics. We see here _Sindu_ applied to the city,
  suggesting _Sindu-fu_ for the reading at the beginning of the
  chapter.

  Silk is a large item in the produce and trade of Sze-ch’wan; and
  through extensive quarters of Ch’êng-tu fu, in every house, the
  spinning, dying, weaving, and embroidering of silk give occupation
  to the people. And though a good deal is exported, much is consumed
  in the province, for the people are very much given to costly
  apparel. Thus silk goods are very conspicuous in the shops of the
  capital. (_Richthofen_.)

[1] My lamented friend Lieutenant F. Garnier had kindly undertaken to
    send me a plan of Ch’êng-tu fu from the place itself, but, as is
    well known, he fell on a daring enterprise elsewhere. [We hope
    that the plan from a Chinese map we give from _M. Marcel Monnier’s

    MS. letter written by Giovanni dell’Affaitado, Venetian Agent at
    Lisbon in 1503, communicated to me by Signor Berchet. The King of
    Melinda was to pay to Portugal a tribute of 1500 _pesi d’oro_, “che

                             CHAPTER XLV.

                   CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF TEBET.


After those five days’ march that I spoke of, you enter a province
which has been sorely ravaged; and this was done in the wars of Mongu
Kaan. There are indeed towns and villages and hamlets, but all harried
and destroyed.{1}

In this region you find quantities of canes, full three palms in girth
and fifteen paces in length, with some three palms’ interval between
the joints. And let me tell you that merchants and other travellers
through that country are wont at nightfall to gather these canes and
make fires of them; for as they burn they make such loud reports that
the lions and bears and other wild beasts are greatly frightened, and
make off as fast as possible; in fact nothing will induce them to come
nigh a fire of that sort. So you see the travellers make those fires to
protect themselves and their cattle from the wild beasts which have so
greatly multiplied since the devastation of the country. And ’tis this
great multiplication of the wild beasts that prevents the country from
being reoccupied. In fact but for the help of these canes, which make
such a noise in burning that the beasts are terrified and kept at a
distance, no one would be able even to travel through the land.

I will tell you how it is that the canes make such a noise. The people
cut the green canes, of which there are vast numbers, and set fire to
a heap of them at once. After they have been awhile burning they burst
asunder, and this makes such a loud report that you might hear it ten
miles off. In fact, any one unused to this noise, who should hear it
unexpectedly, might easily go into a swound or die of fright. But those
who are used to it care nothing about it. Hence those who are not used
to it stuff their ears well with cotton, and wrap up their heads and
faces with all the clothes they can muster; and so they get along until
they have become used to the sound. ’Tis just the same with horses.
Those which are unused to these noises are so alarmed by them that they
break away from their halters and heel-ropes, and many a man has lost
his beasts in this way. So those who would avoid losing their horses
take care to tie all four legs and peg the ropes down strongly, and to
wrap the heads and eyes and ears of the animals closely, and so they
save them. But horses also, when they have heard the noise several
times, cease to mind it. I tell you the truth, however, when I say that
the first time you hear it nothing can be more alarming. And yet, in
spite of all, the lions and bears and other wild beasts will sometimes
come and do much mischief; for their numbers are great in those
tracts.{2}

You ride for 20 days without finding any inhabited spot, so that
travellers are obliged to carry all their provisions with them, and are
constantly falling in with those wild beasts which are so numerous and
so dangerous. After that you come at length to a tract where there
are towns and villages in considerable numbers.{3} The people of those
towns have a strange custom in regard to marriage which I will now
relate.

No man of that country would on any consideration take to wife a girl
who was a maid; for they say a wife is nothing worth unless she has
been used to consort with men. And their custom is this, that when
travellers come that way, the old women of the place get ready, and
take their unmarried daughters or other girls related to them, and go
to the strangers who are passing, and make over the young women to
whomsoever will accept them; and the travellers take them accordingly
and do their pleasure; after which the girls are restored to the
old women who brought them, for they are not allowed to follow the
strangers away from their home. In this manner people travelling that
way, when they reach a village or hamlet or other inhabited place,
shall find perhaps 20 or 30 girls at their disposal. And if the
travellers lodge with those people they shall have as many young women
as they could wish coming to court them! You must know too that the
traveller is expected to give the girl who has been with him a ring or
some other trifle, something in fact that she can show as a lover’s
token when she comes to be married. And it is for this in truth and for
this alone that they follow that custom; for every girl is expected to
obtain at least 20 such tokens in the way I have described before she
can be married. And those who have most tokens, and so can show they
have been most run after, are in the highest esteem, and most sought in
marriage, because they say the charms of such an one are greatest.{4}
But after marriage these people hold their wives very dear, and would
consider it a great villainy for a man to meddle with another’s wife;
and thus though the wives have before marriage acted as you have
heard, they are kept with great care from light conduct afterwards.

Now I have related to you this marriage custom as a good story to tell,
and to show what a fine country that is for young fellows to go to!

The people are Idolaters and an evil generation, holding it no sin to
rob and maltreat: in fact, they are the greatest brigands on earth.
They live by the chase, as well as on their cattle and the fruits of
the earth.

I should tell you also that in this country there are many of the
animals that produce musk, which are called in the Tartar language
_Gudderi_. Those rascals have great numbers of large and fine dogs,
which are of great service in catching the musk-beasts, and so they
procure great abundance of musk. They have none of the Great Kaan’s
paper money, but use salt instead of money. They are very poorly clad,
for their clothes are only of the skins of beasts, and of canvas, and
of buckram.{5} They have a language of their own, and they are called
Tebet. And this country of TEBET forms a very great province, of which
I will give you a brief account.


  NOTE 1.—The mountains that bound the splendid plain of Ch’êng-tu fu
  on the west rise rapidly to a height of 12,000 feet and upwards.
  Just at the skirt of this mountain region, where the great road
  to Lhása enters it, lies the large and bustling city of Yachaufu,
  forming the key of the hill country, and the great entrepôt of
  trade between Sze-ch’wan on the one side, and Tibet and Western
  Yunnan on the other. The present political boundary between China
  Proper and Tibet is to the west of Bathang and the Kin-sha Kiang,
  but till the beginning of last century it lay much further east,
  near _Ta-t’sien-lu_, or, as the Tibetans appear to call it,
  _Tartsédo_ or _Tachindo_, which a Chinese Itinerary given by Ritter
  makes to be 920 _li_, or 11 marches from Ch’êng-tu fu. In Marco’s
  time we must suppose that Tibet was considered to extend several
  marches further east still, or to the vicinity of Yachau.[1] Mr.
  Cooper’s Journal describes the country entered _on the 5th march_
  from Ch’êng-tu as very mountainous, many of the neighbouring peaks
  being capped with snow. And he describes the people as speaking
  a language mixed with Tibetan for some distance before reaching
  Ta-t’sien-lu. Baron Richthofen also who, as we shall see, has
  thrown an entirely new light upon this part of Marco’s itinerary,
  was exactly five days in travelling through a rich and populous
  country, from Ch’êng-tu to Yachau. [Captain Gill left Ch’êng-tu on
  the 10th July, 1877, and reached Ya-chau on the 14th, a distance of
  75 miles.—H. C.] (_Ritter_, IV. 190 _seqq._; _Cooper_, pp. 164–173;
  _Richthofen_ in _Verhandl. Ges. f. Erdk. zu Berlin_, 1874, p. 35.)

  Tibet was always reckoned as a part of the Empire of the Mongol
  Kaans in the period of their greatness, but it is not very clear
  how it came under subjection to them. No conquest of Tibet by their
  armies appears to be related by either the Mahomedan or the Chinese
  historians. Yet it is alluded to by Plano Carpini, who ascribes the
  achievement to an unnamed son of Chinghiz, and narrated by Sanang
  Setzen, who says that the King of Tibet submitted without fighting
  when Chinghiz invaded his country in the year of the Panther
  (1206). During the reign of Mangku Kaan, indeed, Uriangḳadai, an
  eminent Mongol general [son of Subudai] who had accompanied Prince
  Kúblái in 1253 against Yunnan, did in the following year direct
  his arms against the Tibetans. But this campaign, that no doubt to
  which the text alludes as “the wars of Mangu Kaan,” appears to have
  occupied only a part of one season, and was certainly confined to
  the parts of Tibet on the frontiers of Yunnan and Sze-ch’wan. [“In
  the _Yuen-shi_, Tibet is mentioned under different names. Sometimes
  the Chinese history of the Mongols uses the ancient name _T’u-fan_.
  In the Annals, _s.a._ 1251, we read: ‘Mangu Khan entrusted
  _Ho-li-dan_ with the command of the troops against _T’u-fan_.’ _Sub
  anno_ 1254 it is stated that Kúblái (who at that time was still
  the heir-apparent), after subduing the tribes of Yun-nan, entered
  _T’u-fan_, when _So-ho-to_, the ruler of the country, surrendered.
  Again, _s.a._ 1275: ‘The prince _Al-lu-chi_ (seventh son of
  Kúblái) led an expedition to _T’u-fan_.’ In chap. ccii., biography
  of _Ba-sz’-ba_, the Lama priest who invented Kúblái’s official
  alphabet, it is stated that this Lama was a native of _Sa-sz’-kia_
  in T’u-fan.” (_Bretschneider, Med Res._ II. p. 23.)—H. C.] Koeppen
  seems to consider it certain that there was no actual conquest
  of Tibet, and that Kúblái extended his authority over it only by
  diplomacy and the politic handling of the spiritual potentates
  who had for several generations in Tibet been the real rulers of
  the country. It is certain that Chinese history attributes the
  organisation of civil administration in Tibet to Kúblái. Mati
  Dhwaja, a young and able member of the family which held the
  hereditary primacy of the Satya [Sakya] convent, and occupied the
  most influential position in Tibet, was formerly recognised by the
  Emperor as the head of the Lamaite Church and as the tributary
  Ruler of Tibet. He is the same person that we have already (vol. i.
  p. 28) mentioned as the Passepa or Báshpah Lama, the inventor of
  Kúblái’s official alphabet. (_Carpini_, 658, 709; _D’Avezac_, 564;
  _S. Setzen_, 89; _D’Ohsson_, II. 317; _Koeppen_, II. 96; _Amyot_,
  XIV. 128.)

  With the caution that Marco’s Travels in Tibet were limited to the
  same mountainous country on the frontier of Sze-ch’wan, we defer
  further geographical comment till he brings us to Yunnan.

  NOTE 2.—Marco exaggerates a little about the bamboos; but before
  gunpowder became familiar, no sharp explosive sounds of this kind
  were known to ordinary experience, and exaggeration was natural. I
  have been close to a bamboo jungle on fire. There was a great deal
  of noise comparable to musketry; but the bamboos were not of the
  large kind here spoken of. The Hon. Robert Lindsay, describing his
  elephant-catching in Silhet, says: “At night each man lights a fire
  at his post, and furnishes himself with a dozen joints of the large
  bamboo, one of which he occasionally throws into the fire, and the
  air it contains being rarefied by the heat, it explodes with a
  report as loud as a musket.” (_Lives of the Lindsays_, III. 191.)

  [Dr. Bretschneider (_Hist. of Bot. Disc._ I. p. 3) says: “In
  corroboration of Polo’s statement regarding the explosions produced
  when burning bamboos, I may adduce Sir Joseph Hooker’s Himalayan
  Journals (edition of 1891, p. 100), where in speaking of the fires
  in the jungles, he says: ‘Their triumph is in reaching a great
  bamboo clump, when the noise of the flames drowns that of the
  torrents, and as the great stem-joints burst, from the expansion of
  the confined air, the report is as that of a salvo from a park of
  artillery.’”—H. C.]

  [Illustration: Mountaineers on the Borders of Sze ch’wan and
  Yun-nan.]

  Richthofen remarks that nowhere in China does the bamboo attain
  such a size as in this region. Bamboos of three palms in girth
  (28 to 30 inches) exist, but are not ordinary, I should suppose,
  even in Sze-ch’wan. In 1855 I took some pains to procure in Pegu
  a specimen of the largest attainable bamboo. It was 10 inches in
  diameter.

  NOTE 3.—M. Gabriel Durand, a missionary priest, thus describes his
  journey in 1861 to Kiangka, _viâ_ Ta-t’sien-lu, a line of country
  partly coincident with that which Polo is traversing: “Every day
  we made a journey of nine or ten leagues, and halted for the night
  in a _Kung-kuan_. These are posts dotted at intervals of about
  ten leagues along the road to Hlassa, and usually guarded by
  three soldiers, though the more important posts have twenty. With
  the exception of some Tibetan houses, few and far between, these
  are the only habitations to be seen on this silent and deserted
  road.... Lytang was the first collection of houses that we had seen
  in ten days’ march.” (_Ann. de la Propag. de la Foi_, XXXV. 352
  _seqq._)

  NOTE 4.—Such practices are ascribed to many nations. Martini quotes
  something similar from a Chinese author about tribes in Yunnan; and
  Garnier says such loose practices are still ascribed to the Sifan
  near the southern elbow of the Kin-sha Kiang. Even of the Mongols
  themselves and kindred races, Pallas asserts that the young women
  regard a number of intrigues rather as a credit and recommendation
  than otherwise. Japanese ideas seem to be not very different. In
  old times Ælian gives much the same account of the Lydian women.
  Herodotus’s Gindanes of Lybia afford a perfect parallel, “whose
  women wear on their legs anklets of leather. Each lover that a
  woman has gives her one; and she who can show most is the best
  esteemed, as she appears to have been loved by the greatest number
  of men.” (_Martini_, 142; _Garnier_, I. 520; _Pall. Samml._ II.
  235; _Æl. Var. Hist._ III. 1; _Rawl. Herod._ Bk. IV. ch. clxxvi.)

  [“Among some uncivilised peoples, women having many gallants are
  esteemed better than virgins, and are more anxiously desired in
  marriage. This is, for instance, stated to be the case with the
  Indians of Quito, the Laplanders in Regnard’s days, and the Hill
  Tribes of North Aracan. But in each of these cases we are expressly
  told that want of chastity is considered a merit in the bride,
  because it is held to be the best testimony to the value of her
  attractions.” (_Westermarck, Human Marriage_, p. 81.)—H. C.]

  Mr. Cooper’s Journal, when on the banks of the Kin-sha Kiang, west
  of Bathang, affords a startling illustration of the persistence of
  manners in this region: “At 12h. 30m. we arrived at a road-side
  house, near which was a grove of walnut-trees; here we alighted,
  when to my surprise I was surrounded by a group of young girls and
  two elderly women, who invited me to partake of a repast spread
  under the trees.... I thought I had stumbled on a pic-nic party,
  of which the Tibetans are so fond. Having finished, I lighted my
  pipe and threw myself on the grass in a state of castle-building.
  I had not lain thus many seconds when the maidens brought a young
  girl about 15 years old, tall and very fair, placed her on the
  grass beside me, and forming a ring round us, commenced to sing and
  dance. The little maid beside me, however, was bathed in tears.
  All this, I must confess, a little puzzled me, when Philip (the
  Chinese servant) with a long face, came to my aid, saying, ‘_Well,
  Sir, this is a bad business ... they are marrying you._’ Good
  heavens! how startled I was.” For the honourable conclusion of this
  Anglo-Tibetan idyll I must refer to Mr. Cooper’s Journal. (See the
  now published _Travels_, ch. x.)

  NOTE 5.—All this is clearly meant to apply only to the rude
  people towards the Chinese frontier; nor would the Chinese (says
  Richthofen) at this day think the description at all exaggerated,
  as applied to the Lolo who occupy the mountains to the south of
  Yachaufu. The members of the group at p. 47, from Lieutenant
  Garnier’s book, are there termed Man-tzŭ; but the context shows
  them to be of the race of these Lolos. (See below, pp. 60, 61.)
  The passage about the musk animal, both in Pauthier and in the G.
  T., ascribes the word _Gudderi_ to the language “of that people,”
  _i.e._ of the Tibetans. The Geog. Latin, however, has “_linguâ
  Tartaricâ_,” and this is the fact. Klaproth informs us that
  _Guderi_ is the Mongol word. And it will be found (_Kuderi_) in
  Kovalevski’s Dictionary, No. 2594. Musk is still the most valuable
  article that goes from Ta-t’sien-lu to China. Much is smuggled, and
  single travellers will come all the way from Canton or Si-ngan fu
  to take back a small load of it. (_Richthofen_.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] Indeed Richthofen says that the boundary lay a few (German) miles
    west of Yachau. I see that Martini’s map puts it (in the 17th
    century) 10 German geographical miles, or about 46 statute miles,
    west of that city.




                             CHAPTER XLVI.

                  FURTHER DISCOURSE CONCERNING TEBET.


This province, called Tebet, is of very great extent. The people, as I
have told you, have a language of their own, and they are Idolaters,
and they border on Manzi and sundry other regions. Moreover, they are
very great thieves.

The country is, in fact, so great that it embraces eight kingdoms,
and a vast number of cities and villages.{1} It contains in several
quarters rivers and lakes, in which gold-dust is found in great
abundance.{2} Cinnamon also grows there in great plenty. Coral is in
great demand in this country and fetches a high price, for they delight
to hang it round the necks of their women and of their idols.{3} They
have also in this country plenty of fine woollens and other stuffs, and
many kinds of spices are produced there which are never seen in our
country.

Among this people, too, you find the best enchanters and astrologers
that exist in all that quarter of the world; they perform such
extraordinary marvels and sorceries by diabolic art, that it astounds
one to see or even hear of them. So I will relate none of them in this
book of ours; people would be amazed if they heard them, but it would
serve no good purpose.{4}

These people of Tebet are an ill-conditioned race. They have mastiff
dogs as bigs as donkeys, which are capital at seizing wild beasts
[and in particular the wild oxen which are called _Beyamini_, very
great and fierce animals]. They have also sundry other kinds of sporting
dogs, and excellent lanner falcons [and sakers], swift in flight and
well-trained, which are got in the mountains of the country.{5}

Now I have told you in brief all that is to be said about Tebet, and so
we will leave it, and tell you about another province that is called
Caindu.

[Illustration: Village of Eastern Tibet on Sze-ch’wan Frontier. (From
  Cooper.)]

As regards Tebet, however, you should understand that it is subject
to the Great Kaan. So, likewise, all the other kingdoms, regions, and
provinces which are described in this book are subject to the Great
Kaan, nay, even those other kingdoms, regions, and provinces of which I
had occasion to speak at the beginning of the book as belonging to the
son of Argon, the Lord of the Levant, are also subject to the Emperor;
for the former holds his dominion of the Kaan, and is his liegeman
and kinsman of the blood Imperial. So you must know that from this
province forward all the provinces mentioned in our book are subject to
the Great Kaan; and even if this be not specially mentioned, you must
understand that it is so.

Now let us have done with this matter, and I will tell you about the
Province of Caindu.

[Illustration: Roads in Eastern Tibet. (Gorge of the Lan t’sang Kiang,
  from Cooper.)]


  NOTE 1.—Here Marco at least shows that he knew Tibet to be much
  more extensive than the small part of it that he had seen. But
  beyond this his information amounts to little.

  NOTE 2.—“_Or de paliolle._” “_Oro di pagliuola_” (_pagliuola_, “a
  spangle”) must have been the technical phrase for what we call
  gold-dust, and the French now call _or en paillettes_, a phrase
  used by a French missionary in speaking of this very region.
  (_Ann. de la Foi_, XXXVII. 427.) Yet the only example of this use
  of the word cited in the _Voc. Ital. Universale_ is from this
  passage of the Crusca MS.; and Pipino seems not to have understood
  it, translating “_aurum quod dicitur_ Deplaglola”; whilst Zurla
  says erroneously that _pajola_ is an old Italian word for _gold_.
  Pegolotti uses _argento in pagliuola_ (p. 219). A Barcelona tariff
  of 1271 sets so much on every mark of _Pallola_. And the old
  Portuguese navigators seem always to have used the same expression
  for the gold-dust of Africa, _ouro de pajola_. (See _Major’s Prince
  Henry_, pp. 111, 112, 116; _Capmany Memorias_, etc., II. App. p.
  73; also “_Aurum_ de Pajola,” in Usodimare of Genoa, see _Gräberg,
  Annali_, II. 290, quoted by Peschel, p. 178.)

  NOTE 3.—The cinnamon must have been the coarser cassia produced
  in the lower parts of this region. (See note to next chapter.) We
  have already (Book I. ch. xxxi.) quoted Tavernier’s testimony to
  the rage for coral among the Tibetans and kindred peoples. Mr.
  Cooper notices the eager demand for coral at Bathang. (See also
  _Desgodins, La Mission du Thibet_, 310.)

  NOTE 4.—See _supra_, Bk. I. ch. lxi. note 11.

  NOTE 5.—The big Tibetan mastiffs are now well known. Mr. Cooper,
  at Ta-t’sien lu, notes that the people of Tibetan race “keep very
  large dogs, as large as Newfoundlands.” And he mentions a pack of
  dogs of another breed, tan and black, “fine animals of the size
  of setters.” The missionary M. Durand also, in a letter from the
  region in question, says, speaking of a large leopard: “Our brave
  watch-dogs had several times beaten him off gallantly, and one of
  them had even in single combat with him received a blow of the
  paw which had laid his skull open.” (_Ann. de la Prop. de la Foi_,
  XXXVII. 314.) On the title-page of vol. i. we have introduced one
  of these big Tibetan dogs as brought home by the Polos to Venice.

  The “wild oxen called _Beyamini_” are probably some such species as
  the Gaur. _Beyamini_ I suspect to be no Oriental word, but to stand
  for _Buemini_, _i.e._ Bohemian, a name which may have been given
  by the Venetians to either the bison or urus. Polo’s contemporary,
  Brunetto Latini, seems to speak of one of these as still existing
  in his day in Germany: “Autre buef naissent en Alemaigne qui ont
  grans cors, et sont bons por sommier et por vin porter.” (Paris
  ed., p. 228; see also _Lubbock, Pre-historic Times_, 296–7.)

  [Mr. Baber (_Travels_, pp. 39, 40) writes: “A special interest
  attaches to the wild oxen, since they are unknown in any other
  part of China Proper. From a Lolo chief and his followers, most
  enthusiastic hunters, I afterwards learnt that the cattle are met
  with in herds of from seven to twenty head in the recesses of the
  Wilderness, which may be defined as the region between the T’ung
  River and Yachou, but that in general they are rarely seen.... I
  was lucky enough to obtain a pair of horns and part of the hide
  of one of these redoubtable animals, which seem to show that they
  are a kind of bison.” Sir H. Yule remarks in a footnote (_Ibid._
  p. 40): “It is not possible to say from what is stated here what
  the species is, but probably it is a _gavœus_, of which Jerdan
  describes three species. (See _Mammals of India_, pp. 301–307.)
  Mr. Hodgson describes the Gaur (_Gavœus gaurus_ of Jerdan) of the
  forests below Nepaul as fierce and revengeful.”—H. C.]




                            CHAPTER XLVII.

                  CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF CAINDU.


CAINDU is a province lying towards the west,{1} and there is only one
king in it. The people are Idolaters, subject to the Great Kaan, and
they have plenty of towns and villages. [The chief city is also called
Caindu, and stands at the upper end of the province.] There is a lake
here,[1] in which are found pearls [which are white but not round].
But the Great Kaan will not allow them to be fished, for if people
were to take as many as they could find there, the supply would be so
vast that pearls would lose their value, and come to be worth nothing.
Only when it is his pleasure they take from the lake so many as he may
desire; but any one attempting to take them on his own account would be
incontinently put to death.

There is also a mountain in this country wherein they find a kind of
stone called turquoise, in great abundance; and it is a very beautiful
stone. These also the Emperor does not allow to be extracted without
his special order.{2}

I must tell you of a custom that they have in this country regarding
their women. No man considers himself wronged if a foreigner, or any
other man, dishonour his wife, or daughter, or sister, or any woman of
his family, but on the contrary he deems such intercourse a piece of
good fortune. And they say that it brings the favour of their gods and
idols, and great increase of temporal prosperity. For this reason they
bestow their wives on foreigners and other people as I will tell you.

When they fall in with any stranger in want of a lodging they are all
eager to take him in. And as soon as he has taken up his quarters the
master of the house goes forth, telling him to consider everything at
his disposal, and after saying so he proceeds to his vineyards or his
fields, and comes back no more till the stranger has departed. The
latter abides in the caitiff’s house, be it three days or be it four,
enjoying himself with the fellow’s wife or daughter or sister, or
whatsoever woman of the family it best likes him; and as long as he
abides there he leaves his hat or some other token hanging at the door,
to let the master of the house know that he is still there. As long as
the wretched fellow sees that token, he must not go in. And such is the
custom over all that province.{3}

The money matters of the people are conducted in this way. They have
gold in rods which they weigh, and they reckon its value by its weight
in _saggi_, but they have no coined money. Their small change again is
made in this way. They have salt which they boil and set in a mould
[flat below and round above],{4} and every piece from the mould weighs
about half a pound. Now, 80 moulds of this salt are worth one _saggio_
of fine gold, which is a weight so called. So this salt serves them for
small change.{5}

The musk animals are very abundant in that country, and thus of musk
also they have great store. They have likewise plenty of fish which
they catch in the lake in which the pearls are produced. Wild animals,
such as lions, bears, wolves, stags, bucks and roes, exist in great
numbers; and there are also vast quantities of fowl of every kind. Wine
of the vine they have none, but they make a wine of wheat and rice and
sundry good spices, and very good drink it is.{6} There grows also in
this country a quantity of clove. The tree that bears it is a small
one, with leaves like laurel but longer and narrower, and with a small
white flower like the clove.{7} They have also ginger and cinnamon in
great plenty, besides other spices which never reach our countries, so
we need say nothing about them.

Now we may leave this province, as we have told you all about it. But
let me tell you first of this same country of Caindu that you ride
through it ten days, constantly meeting with towns and villages, with
people of the same description that I have mentioned. After riding
those ten days you come to a river called BRIUS, which terminates the
province of Caindu. In this river is found much gold-dust, and there is
also much cinnamon on its banks. It flows to the Ocean Sea.

There is no more to be said about this river, so I will now tell you
about another province called Carajan, as you shall hear in what
follows.


  NOTE 1.—Ramusio’s version here enlarges: “Don’t suppose from my
  saying _towards the west_ that these countries really lie in what
  we call the _west_, but only that we have been travelling from
  regions in the east-north-east _towards_ the west, and hence we
  speak of the countries we come to as lying towards the west.”

  NOTE 2.—Chinese authorities quoted by Ritter mention
  _mother-o’-pearl_ as a product of Lithang, and speak of turquoises
  as found in Djaya to the west of Bathang. (_Ritter_, IV. 235–236.)
  Neither of these places is, however, within the tract which we
  believe to be Caindu. Amyot states that pearls are found in a
  certain river of Yun-nan. (See _Trans. R. A. Soc._ II. 91.)

  NOTE 3.—This alleged practice, like that mentioned in the last
  chapter but one, is ascribed to a variety of people in different
  parts of the world. Both, indeed, have a curious double parallel in
  the story of two remote districts of the Himalaya which was told
  to Bernier by an old Kashmiri. (See Amst. ed. II. 304–305.) Polo
  has told nearly the same story already of the people of Kamul. (Bk.
  I. ch. xli.) It is related by Strabo of the Massagetæ; by Eusebius
  of the Geli and the Bactrians; by Elphinstone of the Hazaras; by
  Mendoza of the Ladrone Islanders; by other authors of the Nairs
  of Malabar, and of some of the aborigines of the Canary Islands.
  (_Caubul_, I. 209; _Mendoza_, II. 254; _Müller’s Strabo_, p. 439;
  _Euseb. Praep. Evan._ vi. 10; _Major’s Pr. Henry_, p. 213.)

  NOTE 4.—Ramusio has here: “as big as a twopenny loaf,” and adds,
  “on the money so made the Prince’s mark is printed; and no one is
  allowed to make it except the royal officers.... And merchants
  take this currency and go to those tribes that dwell among the
  mountains of those parts in the wildest and most unfrequented
  quarters; and there they get a _saggio_ of gold for 60, or 50, or
  40 pieces of this salt money, in proportion as the natives are more
  barbarous and more remote from towns and civilised folk. For in
  such positions they cannot dispose at pleasure of their gold and
  other things, such as musk and the like, for want of purchasers;
  and so they give them cheap.... And the merchants travel also about
  the mountains and districts of Tebet, disposing of this salt money
  in like manner to their own great gain. For those people, besides
  buying necessaries from the merchants, want this salt to use in
  their food; whilst in the towns only broken fragments are used in
  food, the whole cakes being kept to use as money.” This exchange of
  salt cakes for gold forms a curious parallel to the like exchange
  in the heart of Africa, narrated by Cosmas in the 6th century, and
  by Aloisio Cadamosto in the 15th. (See _Cathay_, pp. clxx–clxxi.)
  Ritter also calls attention to an analogous account in Alvarez’s
  description of Ethiopia. “The salt,” Alvarez says, “is current as
  money, not only in the kingdom of Prester John, but also in those
  of the Moors and the pagans, and the people here say that it passes
  right on to Manicongo upon the Western Sea. This salt is dug from
  the mountain, it is said, in squared blocks.... At the place where
  they are dug, 100 or 120 such pieces pass for a drachm of gold ...
  equal to ¾ of a ducat of gold. When they arrive at a certain fair
  ... one day from the salt mine, these go 5 or 6 pieces fewer to the
  drachm. And so, from fair to fair, fewer and fewer, so that when
  they arrive at the capital there will be only 6 or 7 pieces to the
  drachm.” (_Ramusio_, I. 207.) Lieutenant Bower, in his account of
  Major Sladen’s mission, says that at Momein the salt, which was a
  government monopoly, was “made up in rolls of one and two viss” (a
  Rangoon viss is 3 lbs. 5 oz. 5½ drs.), “and stamped” (p. 120).

  [At Hsia-Kuan, near Ta-li, Captain Gill remarked to a friend (II.
  p. 312) “that the salt, instead of being in the usual great flat
  cakes about two or two and a half feet in diameter, was made in
  cylinders eight inches in diameter and nine inches high. ‘Yes,’
  he said, ‘they make them here in a sort of loaves,’ unconsciously
  using almost the words of old Polo, who said the salt in Yun-Nan
  was in pieces ‘as big as a twopenny loaf.’” (See also p.
  334.)—H. C.]

  M. Desgodins, a missionary in this part of Tibet, gives some
  curious details of the way in which the civilised traders still
  prey upon the simple hill-folks of that quarter; exactly as the
  Hindu Banyas prey upon the simple forest-tribes of India. He states
  one case in which the account for a pig had with interest run up to
  2127 bushels of corn! (_Ann. de la Prop. de la Foi_, XXXVI. 320.)

  Gold is said still to be very plentiful in the mountains called
  Gulan Sigong, to the N.W. of Yun-nan, adjoining the great eastern
  branch of the Irawadi, and the Chinese traders go there to barter
  for it. (See _J. A. S. B._ VI. 272.)

  NOTE 5.—Salt is still an object highly coveted by the wild
  Lolos already alluded to, and to steal it is a chief aim of
  their constant raids on Chinese villages. (_Richthofen_ in
  _Verhandlungen_, etc., u.s. p. 36.) On the continued existence of
  the use of salt currency in regions of the same frontier, I have
  been favoured with the following note by M. Francis Garnier, the
  distinguished leader of the expedition of the great Kamboja River
  in its latter part: “Salt currency has a very wide diffusion from
  Muang Yong [in the Burman-Shan country, about lat. 21° 43′] to
  Sheu-pin [in Yun-nan, about lat. 23° 43′]. In the Shan markets,
  especially within the limits named, all purchases are made with
  salt. At Sse-mao and Pou-erl [_Esmok_ and _Puer_ of some of our
  maps], silver, weighed and cut in small pieces, is in our day
  tending to drive out the custom, but in former days it must have
  been universal in the tract of which I am speaking. The salt
  itself, prime necessity as it is, has there to be extracted by
  condensation from saline springs of great depth, a very difficult
  affair. The operation consumes enormous quantities of fuel, and to
  this is partly due the denudation of the country”. Marco’s somewhat
  rude description of the process, “_Il prennent la sel e la font
  cuire, et puis la gitent en forme_,” points to the manufacture
  spoken of in this note. The cut which we give from M. Garnier’s
  work illustrates the process, but the cakes are vastly greater than
  Marco’s. Instead of a half pound they weigh a _picul_, _i.e._ 133⅓
  lbs. In Sze-ch’wan the brine wells are bored to a depth of 700 to
  1000 feet, and the brine is drawn up in bamboo tubes by a gin. In
  Yun-nan the wells are much less deep, and a succession of hand
  pumps is used to raise the brine.

  [Illustration: Salt pans in Yun-nan. (From Garnier.)

  “=Il prennent la sel e la font cuire, et puis la gitent en forme.=”]

  [Mr. Hosie has a chapter (_Three Years in W. China_, VII.) to
  which he has given the title of _Through Caindu to Carajan_;
  regarding salt he writes (p. 121): “The brine wells from which the
  salt is derived lie at Pai yen ching, 14 miles to the south-west
  of the city [of Yen-yuan] ... [they] are only two in number, and
  comparatively shallow, being only 50 feet in depth. Bamboo tubes,
  ropes and buffaloes are here dispensed with, and small wooden tubs,
  with bamboos fixed to their sides as handles for raising, are
  considered sufficient. At one of the wells a staging was erected
  half-way down, and from it the tubs of brine were passed up to the
  workmen above. Passing from the wells to the evaporating sheds, we
  found a series of mud furnaces with round holes at the top, into
  which cone-shaped pans, manufactured from iron obtained in the
  neighbourhood, and varying in height from one to two and a half
  feet, were loosely fitted. When a pan has been sufficiently heated,
  a ladleful of the brine is poured into it, and, bubbling up to
  the surface, it sinks, leaving a saline deposit on the inside of
  the pan. This process is repeated until a layer, some four inches
  thick, and corresponding to the shape of the pan, is formed, when
  the salt is removed as a hollow cone ready for market. Care must be
  taken to keep the bottom of the pan moist; otherwise, the salt cone
  would crack, and be rendered unfit for the rough carriage which it
  experiences on the backs of pack animals. A soft coal, which is
  found just under the surface of the yellow-soiled hills seven miles
  to the west of Pai-yen-ching, is the fuel used in the furnaces.
  The total daily output of salt at these wells does not exceed two
  tons a day, and the cost at the wells, including the Government
  tax, amounts to about three half-pence a pound. The area of supply,
  owing to the country being sparsely populated, is greater than the
  output would lead one to expect.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 6.—The spiced wine of Kien-ch’ang (see note to next chapter)
  has even now a high repute. (_Richthofen_.)

  NOTE 7.—M. Pauthier will have it that Marco was here the discoverer
  of Assam tea. Assam is, indeed, far out of our range, but his
  notice of this plant, with the laurel-like leaf and white flower,
  was brought strongly to my recollection in reading Mr. Cooper’s
  repeated notices, almost in this region, of the _large-leaved
  tea-tree, with its white flowers_; and, again, of “the hills
  covered with _tea-oil_ trees, all white with flowers.” Still, one
  does not clearly see why Polo should give tea-trees the name of
  cloves.

  Failing explanation of this, I should suppose that the cloves of
  which the text speaks were _cassia-buds_, an article once more
  prominent in commerce (as indeed were all similar aromatics)
  than now, but still tolerably well known. I was at once supplied
  with them at a _drogheria_, in the city where I write (Palermo),
  on asking for _Fiori di Canella_, the name under which they are
  mentioned repeatedly by Pegolotti and Uzzano, in the 14th and 15th
  centuries. Friar Jordanus, in speaking of the cinnamon (or cassia)
  of Malabar, says, “it is the bark of a large tree which has fruit
  and _flowers like cloves_” (p. 28). The cassia-buds have indeed a
  general resemblance to cloves, but they are shorter, lighter in
  colour, and not angular. The cinnamon, mentioned in the next lines
  as abundantly produced in the same region, was no doubt one of the
  inferior sorts, called cassia-bark.

  Williams says: “Cassia grows in all the southern provinces of
  China, especially Kwang-si and Yun-nan, also in Annam, Japan,
  and the Isles of the Archipelago. The wood, bark, buds, seeds,
  twigs, pods, leaves, oil, are all objects of commerce.... The buds
  (_kwei-tz’_) are the fleshy ovaries of the seeds; they are pressed
  at one end, so that they bear some resemblance to cloves in shape.”
  Upwards of 500 _piculs_ (about 30 tons), valued at 30 dollars each,
  are annually exported to Europe and India. (_Chin. Commercial
  Guide_, 113–114).

  The only doubt as regards this explanation will probably be whether
  the cassia would be found at such a height as we may suppose to
  be that of the country in question above the sea-level. I know
  that cassia bark is gathered in the Kasia Hills of Eastern Bengal
  up to a height of about 4000 feet above the sea, and at least the
  valleys of “Caindu” are probably not too elevated for this product.
  Indeed, that of the Kin-sha or _Brius_, near where I suppose Polo
  to cross it, is only 2600 feet. Positive evidence I cannot adduce.
  No cassia or cinnamon was met with by M. Garnier’s party where they
  intersected this region.

  But in this 2nd edition I am able to state on the authority of
  Baron Richthofen that cassia is produced in the whole length of the
  valley of Kien-ch’ang (which is, as we shall see in the notes on
  next chapter, Caindu), though in no other part of Sze-ch’wan nor in
  Northern Yun-nan.

  [Captain Gill (_River of Golden Sand_, II. p. 263) writes: “There
  were chestnut trees ...; and the Kwei-Hua, a tree ‘with leaves like
  the laurel, and with a small white flower, like the clove,’ having
  a delicious, though rather a luscious smell. This was the Cassia,
  and I can find no words more suitable to describe it than those of
  Polo which I have just used.”—H. C.]

  _Ethnology_.—The Chinese at Ch’êng-tu fu, according to Richthofen,
  classify the aborigines of the Sze-ch’wan frontier as _Man-tzŭ,
  Lolo, Si-fan_, and _Tibetan_. Of these the Si-fan are furthest
  north, and extend far into Tibet. The Man-tzŭ (properly so called)
  are regarded as the remnant of the ancient occupants of Sze-ch’wan,
  and now dwell in the mountains about the parallel 30°, and along
  the Lhása road, Ta-t’sien lu being about the centre of their tract.
  The Lolo are the wildest and most independent, occupying the
  mountains on the left of the Kin-sha Kiang where it runs northwards
  (see above p. 48, and below p. 69) and also to some extent on its
  right. The Tibetan tribes lie to the west of the Man-tzŭ, and to
  the west of Kien-ch’ang. (See next chapter.)

  Towards the Lan-ts’ang Kiang is the quasi-Tibetan tribe called
  by the Chinese _Mossos_, by the Tibetans _Guions_, and between
  the Lan-ts’ang and the Lú-Kiang or Salwen are the _Lissús_, wild
  hill-robbers and great musk hunters, like those described by Polo
  at p. 45. Garnier, who gives these latter particulars, mentions
  that near the confluence of the Yalung and Kin-sha Kiang there
  are tribes called _Pa-i_, as there are in the south of Yun-nan,
  and, like the latter, of distinctly Shan or Laotian character. He
  also speaks of _Si-fan_ tribes in the vicinity of Li-kiang fu,
  and coming south of the Kin-sha Kiang even to the east of Ta-li.
  Of these are told such loose tales as Polo tells of _Tebet_ and
  _Caindu_.

  [In the _Topography of the Yun-nan Province_ (edition of 1836)
  there is a catalogue of 141 classes of aborigines, each with a
  separate name and illustration, without any attempt to arrive at a
  broader classification. Mr. Bourne has been led to the conviction
  that exclusive of the Tibetans (including Si-fan and Ku-tsung),
  there are but three great non-Chinese races in Southern China: the
  Lolo, the Shan, and the Miao-tzŭ. (_Report, China_, No. 1, 1888,
  p. 87.) This classification is adopted by Dr. Deblenne. (_Mission
  Lyonnaise_.)

  _Man-tzŭ, Man_, is a general name for “barbarian” (see my note in
  _Odoric de Pordenone_, p. 248 _seqq._); it is applied as well to
  the Lolo as to the Si-fan.

  Mr. Parker remarks (_China Review_, XX. p. 345) that the epithet
  of _Man-tzŭ_, or “barbarians,” dates from the time when the Shans,
  Annamese, Miao-tzŭ, etc., occupied nearly all South China, for it
  is essentially to the Indo-Chinese that the term Man-tzŭ belongs.

  Mr. Hosie writes (_Three years in W. China_, 122): “At the time
  when Marco Polo passed through Caindu, this country was in the
  possession of the Si-fans.... At the present day, they occupy
  the country to the west, and are known under the generic name of
  Man-tzŭ.”

  “It has already been remarked that _Si-fan_, convertible with
  _Man-tzŭ_, is a loose Chinese expression of no ethnological value,
  meaning nothing more than Western barbarians; but in a more
  restricted sense it is used to designate a people (or peoples)
  which inhabits the valley of the Yalung and the upper T’ung, with
  contiguous valleys and ranges, from about the twenty-seventh
  parallel to the borders of Koko-nor. This people is sub-divided
  into eighteen tribes.” (_Baber_, p. 81.)

  Si-fan or Pa-tsiu is the name by which the Chinese call the Tibetan
  tribes which occupy part of Western China. (_Devéria_, p. 167.)

  [Illustration: Black Lolo.]

  Dr. Bretschneider writes (_Med. Res._ II. p. 24): “The
  north-eastern part of Tibet was sometimes designated by the Chinese
  name Si-fan, and Hyacinth [Bitchurin] is of opinion that in ancient
  times this name was even applied to the whole of Tibet. _Si-fan_
  means, ‘Western Barbarians.’ The biographer of Hiuen-Tsang reports
  that when this traveller, in 629, visited Liang-chau (in the
  province of Kan-Suh), this city was the entrepôt for merchants
  from _Si-fan_ and the countries east of the Ts’ung-ling mountains.
  In the history of the Hia and Tangut Empire (in the _Sung-shi_)
  we read, _s. a._ 1003, that the founder of this Empire invaded
  _Si-fan_ and then proceeded to _Si-liang_ (Liang-chau). The
  _Yuen-shi_ reports, _s. a._ 1268: ‘The (Mongol) Emperor ordered
  _Meng-gu-dai_ to invade _Si-fan_ with 6000 men.’ The name Si-fan
  appears also in ch. ccii., biography of _Dan-ba_.” It is stated
  in the _Ming-shi_, “that the name _Si-fan_ is applied to the
  territory situated beyond the frontiers of the Chinese provinces
  of Shen-si (then including the eastern part of present Kan-Suh)
  and Sze-ch’wan, and inhabited by various tribes of Tangut race,
  anciently known in Chinese history under the name of _Si Kiang_....
  The _Kuang yu ki_ notices that _Si-fan_ comprises the territory
  of the south-west of Shen-si, west of Sze-ch’wan and north-west
  of Yun-nan.... The tribute presented by the Si-fan tribes to
  the Emperor used to be carried to the court at Peking by way of
  Ya-chau in Sze-ch’wan.” (_Bretschneider_, 203.) The Tangutans of
  Prjevalsky, north-east of Tibet, in the country of Ku-ku nor,
  correspond to the Si-fan.

  “The Ta-tu River may be looked upon as the southern limit of the
  region inhabited by Sifan tribes, and the northern boundary of the
  Lolo country which stretches southwards to the Yang-tzŭ and east
  from the valley of Kien-ch’ang towards the right bank of the Min.”
  (_Hosie_, p. 102.)

  To Mr. E. C. Baber we owe the most valuable information regarding
  the Lolo people:

  “‘Lolo’ is itself a word of insult, of unknown Chinese origin,
  which should not be used in their presence, although they excuse
  it and will even sometimes employ it in the case of ignorant
  strangers. In the report of Governor-General Lo Ping-chang,
  above quoted, they are called ‘I,’ the term applied by Chinese
  to Europeans. They themselves have no objection to being styled
  ‘I-chia’ (I families), but that word is not their native name.
  Near Ma-pien they call themselves ‘Lo-su’; in the neighbourhood of
  Lui-po T’ing their name is ‘No-su’ or ‘Ngo-su’ (possibly a mere
  variant of ‘Lo-su’); near Hui-li-chou the term is ‘Lé-su’—the
  syllable Lé being pronounced as in French. The subject tribes on
  the T’ung River, near Mount Wa, also name themselves ‘Ngo-su.’ I
  have found the latter people speak very disrespectfully of the
  Lé-su, which argues an internal distinction; but there can be no
  doubt that they are the same race, and speak the same language,
  though with minor differences of dialect.” (_Baber, Travels_,
  66–67.)

  “With very rare exceptions the male Lolo, rich or poor, free or
  subject, may be instantly known by his _horn_. All his hair is
  gathered into a knot over his forehead and there twisted up in a
  cotton cloth so as to resemble the horn of a unicorn. The horn with
  its wrapper is sometimes a good nine inches long. They consider
  this _coiffure_ sacred, so at least I was told, and even those who
  wear a short pig-tail for convenience in entering Chinese territory
  still conserve the indigenous horn, concealed for the occasion
  under the folds of the Sze-ch’wan turban.” (_Baber_, p. 61.) See
  these horns on figures, Bk. II. ch. lviii.

  [Illustration: White Lolo.]

  “The principal clothing of a Lolo is his mantle, a capacious
  sleeveless garment of grey or black felt gathered round his neck
  by a string, and reaching nearly to his heels. In the case of the
  better classes the mantle is of fine felt—in great request among
  the Chinese—and has a fringe of cotton-web round its lower border.
  For journeys on horseback they have a similar cloak differing only
  in being slit half-way up the back; a wide lappet covering the
  opening lies easily along the loins and croup of the horse. The
  colour of the felt is originally grey, but becomes brown-black
  or black, in process of time. It is said that the insects which
  haunt humanity never infest these gabardines. The Lolo generally
  gathers this garment closely round his shoulders and crosses his
  arms inside. His legs, clothed in trousers of Chinese cotton, are
  swathed in felt bandages bound on with strings, and he has not yet
  been super-civilised into the use of foot-gear. In summer a cotton
  cloak is often substituted for the felt mantle. The hat, serving
  equally for an umbrella, is woven of bamboo, in a low conical
  shape, and is covered with felt. Crouching in his felt mantle under
  this roof of felt the hardy Lolo is impervious to wind or rain.”
  (_Baber, Travels_, 61–62.)

  “The word, ‘Black-bone,’ is generally used by the Chinese as a name
  for the independent Lolos, but in the mouth of a Lolo it seems to
  mean a ‘freeman’ or ‘noble,’ in which sense it is not a whit more
  absurd than the ‘blue-blood,’ of Europeans. The ‘White-bones,’ an
  inferior class, but still Lolo by birth, are, so far as I could
  understand, the vassals and retainers of the patricians—the people,
  in fact. A third class consists of Wa-tzŭ, or slaves, who are all
  captive Chinese. It does not appear whether the servile class is
  sub-divided, but, at any rate, the slaves born in Lolodom are
  treated with more consideration than those who have been captured
  in slave-hunts.” (_Baber, Travels_, 67.)

  According to the French missionary, Paul Vial (_Les Lolos_,
  Shang-hai, 1898) the Lolos say that they come from the country
  situated between Tibet and Burma. The proper manner to address a
  Lolo in Chinese is _Lao-pen-kia_. The book of Father Vial contains
  a very valuable chapter on the writing of the Lolos. Mr. F. S.
  A. Bourne writes (_Report, China_, No. I. 1888, p. 88):—“The old
  Chinese name for this race was ‘Ts’uan Man’— ‘Ts’uan barbarians,’
  a name taken from one of their chiefs. The _Yun-nan Topography_
  says:—‘The name of “Ts’uan Man” is a very ancient one, and
  originally the tribes of Ts’uan were very numerous. There was that
  called “Lu-lu Man,” for instance, now improperly called “Lo-Lo.”’
  These people call themselves ‘Nersu,’ and the vocabularies show
  that they stretch in scattered communities as far as Ssŭ-mao and
  along the whole southern border of Yun-nan. It appears from the
  _Topography_ that they are found also on the Burmese border.”

  The _Moso_ call themselves _Nashi_ and are called _Djiung_ by the
  Tibetans; their ancient capital is Li-kiang fu which was taken by
  their chief Mong-ts’u under the Sung Dynasty; the Mongols made
  of their country the kingdom of Chaghan-djang. Li-kiang is the
  territory of Yuê-si Chao, called also Mo-sie (Moso), one of the
  six Chao of Nan-Chao. The Moso of Li-kiang call themselves _Ho_.
  They have an epic styled _Djiung-Ling_ (Moso Division) recounting
  the invasion of part of Tibet by the Moso. The Moso were submitted
  during the 8th century, by the King of Nan-Chao. They have a
  special hieroglyphic scrip, a specimen of which has been given by
  Devéria. (_Frontière_, p. 166.) A manuscript was secured by Captain
  Gill, on the frontier east of Li-t’ang, and presented by him to
  the British Museum (_Add._ MSS. Or. 2162); T. de Lacouperie gave
  a facsimile of it. (Plates I., II. of _Beginnings of Writing_.)
  Prince Henri d’Orléans and M. Bonin both brought home a Moso
  manuscript with a Chinese explanation.

  Dr. Anderson (_Exped. to Yunnan_, Calcutta, p. 136) says the
  _Li-sus_, or _Lissaus_ are “a small hill-people, with fair, round,
  flat faces, high cheek bones, and some little obliquity of the
  eye.” These Li-su or Li-siè, are scattered throughout the Yunnanese
  prefectures of Yao-ngan, Li-kiang, Ta-li and Yung-ch’ang; they were
  already in Yun-Nan in the 4th century when the Chinese general Ch’u
  Chouang-kiao entered the country. (_Devéria, Front._, p. 164.)

  The _Pa-y_ or _P’o-y_ formed under the Han Dynasty the principality
  of P’o-tsiu and under the T’ang Dynasty the tribes of Pu-hiung and
  of Si-ngo, which were among the thirty-seven tribes dependent on
  the ancient state of Nan-Chao and occupied the territory of the
  sub-prefectures of Kiang-Chuen (Ch’êng-kiang fu) and of Si-ngo
  (Lin-ngan fu). They submitted to China at the beginning of the
  Yuen Dynasty; their country bordered upon Burma (Mien-tien) and
  Ch’ê-li or Kiang-Hung (Xieng-Hung), in Yun-Nan, on the right
  bank of the Mekong River. According to Chinese tradition, the
  Pa-y descended from Muong Tsiu-ch’u, ninth son of Ti Muong-tsiu,
  son of Piao-tsiu-ti (Asôka). Devéria gives (p. 105) a specimen
  of the Pa-y writing (16th century). (_Devéria, Front._, 99,
  117; _Bourne, Report_, p. 88.) Chapter iv. of the Chinese work,
  _Sze-i-kwan-k’ao_, is devoted to the _Pa-y_, including the
  sub-divisions of Muong-Yang, Muong-Ting, Nan-tien, Tsien-ngaï,
  Lung-chuen, Wei-yuan, Wan-tien, Chen-k’ang, Ta-how, Mang-shi,
  Kin-tung, Ho-tsin, Cho-lo tien. (_Devéria, Mél. de Harlez_, p. 97.)
  I give a specimen of Pa-yi writing from a Chinese work purchased
  by Father Amiot at Peking, now in the Paris National Library
  (Fonds chinois, No. 986). (See on this scrip, _F. W. K. Müller,
  T’oung-Pao_, III. p. 1, and V. p. 329; _E. H. Parker, The Muong
  Language, China Review_, I. 1891, p. 267; _P. Lefèvre-Pontalis,

  These ethnological matters have to be handled cautiously, for there
  is great ambiguity in the nomenclature. Thus _Man-tzŭ_ is often
  used generically for aborigines, and the _Lolos_ of Richthofen are
  called Man-tzŭ by Garnier and Blakiston; whilst _Lolo_ again has
  in Yun-nan apparently a very comprehensive generic meaning, and
  is so used by Garnier. (_Richt. Letter_ VII. 67–68 and MS. notes;

                            CHAPTER XLVIII.

                  CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF CARAJAN.


When you have passed that River you enter on the province of CARAJAN,
which is so large that it includes seven kingdoms. It lies towards
the west; the people are Idolaters, and they are subject to the Great
Kaan. A son of his, however, is there as King of the country, by name
ESSENTIMUR; a very great and rich and puissant Prince; and he well and
justly rules his dominion, for he is a wise man, and a valiant.

After leaving the river that I spoke of, you go five days’ journey
towards the west, meeting with numerous towns and villages. The country
is one in which excellent horses are bred, and the people live by
cattle and agriculture. They have a language of their own which is
passing hard to understand. At the end of those five days’ journey you
come to the capital, which is called YACHI, a very great and noble
city, in which are numerous merchants and craftsmen.{1}

[Illustration: _Pa-y_ script.]

The people are of sundry kinds, for there are not only Saracens and
Idolaters, but also a few Nestorian Christians.{2} They have wheat and
rice in plenty. Howbeit they never eat wheaten bread, because in that
country it is unwholesome.{3} Rice they eat, and make of it sundry
messes, besides a kind of drink which is very clear and good, and makes
a man drunk just as wine does.

Their money is such as I will tell you. They use for the purpose
certain white porcelain shells that are found in the sea, such as are
sometimes put on dogs’ collars; and 80 of these porcelain shells pass
for a single weight of silver, equivalent to two Venice groats, _i.e._
24 piccoli. Also eight such weights of silver count equal to one such
weight of gold.{4}

They have brine-wells in this country from which they make salt, and
all the people of those parts make a living by this salt. The King,
too, I can assure you, gets a great revenue from this salt.{5}

There is a lake in this country of a good hundred miles in compass, in
which are found great quantities of the best fish in the world; fish of
great size, and of all sorts.

They reckon it no matter for a man to have intimacy with another’s
wife, provided the woman be willing.

Let me tell you also that the people of that country eat their meat
raw, whether it be of mutton, beef, buffalo, poultry, or any other
kind. Thus the poor people will go to the shambles, and take the raw
liver as it comes from the carcase and cut it small, and put it in
a sauce of garlic and spices, and so eat it; and other meat in like
manner, raw, just as we eat meat that is dressed.{6}

Now I will tell you about a further part of the Province of Carajan, of
which I have been speaking.


  NOTE 1.—We have now arrived at the great province of CARAJAN,
  the KARÁJÁNG of the Mongols, which we know to be YUN-NAN, and
  at its capital YACHI, which—I was about to add—we know to be
  YUN-NAN-FU. But I find all the commentators make it something
  else. Rashiduddin, however, in his detail of the twelve Sings or
  provincial governments of China under the Mongols, thus speaks:
  “10th, KARÁJÁNG. This used to be an independent kingdom, and the
  Sing is established at the great city of YÁCHI. All the inhabitants
  are Mahomedans. The chiefs are Noyan Takin, and Yaḳub Beg, son
  of ’Ali Beg, the Belúch.” And turning to Pauthier’s corrected
  account of the same distribution of the empire from authentic
  Chinese sources (p. 334), we find: “8. The administrative province
  of Yun-nan.... Its capital, chief town also of the canton of the
  same name, was called _Chung-khing_, now YUN-NAN-FU.” Hence Yachi
  was Yun-nan-fu. This is still a large city, having a rectangular
  rampart with 6 gates, and a circuit of about 6½ miles. The suburbs
  were destroyed by the Mahomedan rebels. The most important trade
  there now is in the metallic produce of the Province. [According to
  _Oxenham, Historical Atlas_, there were _ten_ provinces or _sheng_
  (Liao-yang, Chung-shu, Shen-si, Ho-nan, Sze-ch’wan, _Yun-nan_,
  Hu-kwang, Kiang-che, Kiang-si and Kan-suh) and _twelve_ military
  governorships.—H. C.]

  _Yachi_ was perhaps an ancient corruption of the name _Yichau_,
  which the territory bore (according to Martini and Biot) under the
  Han; but more probably _Yichau_ was a Chinese transformation of the
  real name _Yachi_. The Shans still call the city Muang _Chi_, which
  is perhaps another modification of the same name.

  We have thus got Ch’êng-tu fu as one fixed point, and Yun-nan-fu as
  another, and we have to track the traveller’s itinerary between the
  two, through what Ritter called with reason a _terra incognita_.
  What little was known till recently of this region came from the
  Catholic missionaries. Of late the veil has begun to be lifted;
  the daring excursion of Francis Garnier and his party in 1868
  intersected the tract towards the south; Mr. T. T. Cooper crossed
  it further north, by Ta-t’sien lu, Lithang and Bathang; Baron v.
  Richthofen in 1872 had penetrated several marches towards the heart
  of the mystery, when an unfortunate mishap compelled his return,
  but he brought back with him much precious information.

  Five days forward from Ch’êng-tu fu brought us on Tibetan ground.
  Five days backward from Yun-nan fu should bring us to the river
  Brius, with its gold-dust and the frontier of Caindu. Wanting a
  local scale for a distance of five days, I find that our next point
  in advance, Marco’s city of Carajan undisputably _Tali-fu_, is
  said by him to be ten days from Yachi. The direct distance between
  the cities of Yun-nan and Ta-li I find by measurement on Keith
  Johnston’s map to be 133 Italian miles. [The distance by road is
  215 English miles. (See _Baber_, p. 191.)—H. C.] Taking half this
  as radius, the compasses swept from Yun-nan-fu as centre, intersect
  near its most southerly elbow the great upper branch of the Kiang,
  the _Kin-sha Kiang_ of the Chinese, or “River of the Golden
  Sands,” the MURUS USSU and BRICHU of the Mongols and Tibetans, and
  manifestly the auriferous BRIUS of our traveller.[1] Hence also the
  country north of this elbow is CAINDU.

  [Illustration: Garden-House on the Lake at Yun-nan-fu, Yachi of
    Polo. (From Garnier.)

    “=Je voz di q’il ont un lac qe gire environ bien cent miles.=”]

  I leave the preceding paragraph as it stood in the first edition,
  because it shows how _near_ the true position of Caindu these
  unaided deductions from our author’s data had carried me. That
  paragraph was followed by an erroneous hypothesis as to the
  intermediate part of that journey, but, thanks to the new light
  shed by Baron Richthofen, we are enabled now to lay down the whole
  itinerary from Ch’êng-tu fu to Yun-nan fu with confidence in its
  accuracy.

  The Kin-sha Kiang or Upper course of the Great Yang-tzŭ, descending
  from Tibet to Yun-nan, forms the great bight or elbow to which
  allusion has just been made, and which has been a feature known to
  geographers ever since the publication of D’Anville’s atlas. The
  tract enclosed in this elbow is cut in two by another great Tibetan
  River, the Yarlung, or Yalung-Kiang, which joins the Kin-sha not
  far from the middle of the great bight; and this Yalung, just
  before the confluence, receives on the left a stream of inferior
  calibre, the Ngan-ning Ho, which also flows in a valley parallel
  to the meridian, like all that singular _fascis_ of great rivers
  between Assam and Sze-ch’wan.

  This River Ngan-ning waters a valley called Kien-ch’ang, containing
  near its northern end a city known by the same name, but in our
  modern maps marked as Ning-yuan fu; this last being the name
  of a department of which it is the capital, and which embraces
  much more than the valley of Kien-ch’ang. The town appears,
  however, as Kien-ch’ang in the _Atlas Sinensis_ of Martini,
  and as _Kienchang-ouei_ in D’Anville. This remarkable valley,
  imbedded as it were in a wilderness of rugged highlands and wild
  races, accessible only by two or three long and difficult routes,
  rejoices in a warm climate, a most productive soil, scenery that
  seems to excite enthusiasm even in Chinamen, and a population
  noted for amiable temper. Towns and villages are numerous. The
  people are said to be descended from Chinese immigrants, but their
  features have little of the Chinese type, and they have probably
  a large infusion of aboriginal blood. [Kien-ch’ang, “otherwise
  the Prefecture of Ning-yuan, is perhaps the least known of the
  Eighteen Provinces,” writes Mr. Baber. (_Travels_, p. 58.) “Two
  or three sentences in the book of Ser Marco, to the effect that
  after crossing high mountains, he reached a fertile country
  containing many towns and villages, and inhabited by a very
  immoral population, constitute to this day the only description we
  possess of _Cain-du_, as he calls the district.” Baber adds (p.
  82): “Although the main valley of Kien-ch’ang is now principally
  inhabited by Chinese, yet the Sifan or Menia people are frequently
  met with, and most of the villages possess two names, one Chinese,
  and the other indigenous. Probably in Marco Polo’s time a Menia
  population predominated, and the valley was regarded as part of
  Menia. If Marco had heard that name, he would certainly have
  recorded it; but it is not one which is likely to reach the ears of
  a stranger. The Chinese people and officials never employ it, but
  use in its stead an alternative name, _Chan-tu_ or _Chan-tui_, of
  precisely the same application, which I make bold to offer as the
  original of Marco’s Caindu, or preferably Ciandu.”—H. C.]

  This valley is bounded on the east by the mountain country of the
  Lolos, which extends north nearly to Yachau (_supra_, pp. 45, 48,
  60), and which, owing to the fierce intractable character of the
  race, forms throughout its whole length an impenetrable barrier
  between East and West. [The Rev. Gray Owen, of Ch’êng-tu, wrote
  (_Jour. China B. R. A. S._ xxviii. 1893–1894, p. 59): “The only
  great trade route infested by brigands is that from Ya-chau to
  Ning-yuan fu, where Lo-lo brigands are numerous, especially in the
  autumn. Last year I heard of a convoy of 18 mules with Shen-si
  goods on the above-mentioned road captured by these brigands,
  muleteers and all taken inside the Lo-lo country. It is very seldom
  that captives get out of Lo-lo-dom, because the ransom asked is too
  high, and the Chinese officials are not gallant enough to buy out
  their unfortunate countrymen. The Lo-los hold thousands of Chinese
  in slavery; and more are added yearly to the number.”—H. C.] Two
  routes run from Ch’êng-tu fu to Yun-nan; these fork at Ya-chau and
  thenceforward are entirely separated by this barrier. To the east
  of it is the route which descends the Min River to Siu-chau, and
  then passes by Chao-tong and Tong-chuan to Yun-nan fu: to the west
  of the barrier is a route leading through Kien-ch’ang to Ta-li fu,
  but throwing off a branch from Ning-yuan southward in the direction
  of Yun-nan fu.

  This road from Ch’êng-tu fu to Ta-li by Ya-chau and Ning-yuan
  appears to be that by which the greater part of the goods for Bhamó
  and Ava used to travel before the recent Mahomedan rebellion; it
  is almost certainly the road by which Kúblái, in 1253, during the
  reign of his brother Mangku Kaan, advanced to the conquest of
  Ta-li, then the head of an independent kingdom in Western Yun-nan.
  As far as Ts’ing-k’i hien, 3 marches beyond Ya-chau, this route
  coincides with the great Tibet road by Ta-t’sien lu and Bathang to
  L’hása, and then it diverges to the left.

  We may now say without hesitation that by this road Marco
  travelled. His _Tibet_ commences with the mountain region near
  Ya-chau; his 20 days’ journey through a devastated and dispeopled
  tract is the journey to Ning-yuan fu. Even now, from Ts’ing-k’i
  onwards for several days, not a single inhabited place is seen.
  The official route from Ya-chau to Ning-yuan lays down 13 stages,
  but it generally takes from 15 to 18 days. Polo, whose journeys
  seem often to have been shorter than the modern average,[2] took
  20. On descending from the highlands he comes once more into a
  populated region, and enters the charming Valley of Kien-ch’ang.
  This valley, with its capital near the upper extremity, its
  numerous towns and villages, its cassia, its spiced wine, and
  its termination southward on the River of the Golden Sands, is
  CAINDU. The traveller’s road from Ningyuan to Yunnanfu probably lay
  through Hwei-li, and the Kin-sha Kiang would be crossed as already
  indicated, near its most southerly bend, and almost due north of
  Yun-nan fu. (See _Richthofen_ as quoted at pp. 45–46.)

  As regards the _name_ of CAINDU or GHEINDU (as in G. T.), I think
  we may safely recognise in the last syllable the _do_ which is so
  frequent a termination of Tibetan names (Amdo, Tsiamdo, etc.);
  whilst the _Cain_, as Baron Richthofen has pointed out, probably
  survives in the first part of the name _Kien_chang.

  [Baber writes (pp. 80–81): “Colonel Yule sees in the word _Caindu_
  a variation of ‘Chien-ch’ang,’ and supposes the syllable ‘du’ to
  be the same as the termination ‘du,’ ‘do,’ or ‘tu,’ so frequent in
  Tibetan names. In such names, however, ‘do’ never means a district,
  but always a confluence, or a town near a confluence, as might
  almost be guessed from a map of Tibet.... Unsatisfied with Colonel
  Yule’s identification, I cast about for another, and thought
  for a while that a clue had been found in the term ‘Chien-t’ou’
  (sharp-head), applied to certain Lolo tribes. But the idea had to
  be abandoned, since Marco Polo’s anecdote about the ‘caitiff,’ and
  the loose manners of his family, could never have referred to the
  Lolos, who are admitted even by their Chinese enemies to possess a
  very strict code indeed of domestic regulations. The Lolos being
  eliminated, the Si-fans remained; and before we had been many days
  in their neighbourhood, stories were told us of their conduct which
  a polite pen refuses to record. It is enough to say that Marco’s
  account falls rather short of the truth, and most obviously applies
  to the Si-fan.”

  Devéria (_Front._ p. 146 note) says that Kien-ch’ang is the ancient
  territory of Kiung-tu which, under the Han Dynasty, fell into the
  hands of the Tibetans, and was made by the Mongols the march of
  Kien-ch’ang (_Che-Kong-t’u_); it is the _Caindu_ of Marco Polo;
  under the Han Dynasty it was the Kiun or division of Yueh-sui
  or Yueh-hsi. Devéria quotes from the _Yuen-shi-lei pien_ the
  following passage relating to the year 1284: “The twelve tribes
  of the Barbarians to the south-west of _Kien-tou_ and _Kin-Chi_
  submitted; Kien-tou was administered by Mien (Burma); Kien-tou
  submits because the Kingdom of Mien has been vanquished.” Kien-tou
  is the _Chien-t’ou_ of Baber, the Caindu of Marco Polo. (_Mélanges
  de Harlez_, p. 97.) According to Mr. E. H. Parker (_China Review_,
  xix. p. 69), Yueh-hsi or Yueh-sui “is the modern Kien-ch’ang
  Valley, the Caindu of Marco Polo, between the Yalung and Yang-tzŭ
  Rivers; the only non-Chinese races found there now are the Si-fan
  and Lolos.”—H. C.]

  [Illustration: Road descending from the Table-Land of Yun-nan into
    the Valley of the Kin-sha Kiang (the _Brius_ of Polo).

    (After Garnier.)]

  Turning to minor particulars, the Lake of Caindu in which the
  pearls were found is doubtless one lying near Ning-yuan, whose
  beauty Richthofen heard greatly extolled, though nothing of the
  pearls. [Mr. Hosie writes (_Three Years_, 112–113): “If the former
  tradition be true (the old city of Ning-yuan having given place
  to a large lake in the early years of the Ming Dynasty), the
  lake had no existence when Marco Polo passed through Caindu, and
  yet we find him mentioning a lake in the country in which pearls
  were found. Curiously enough, although I had not then read the
  Venetian’s narrative, one of the many things told me regarding the
  lake was that pearls are found in it, and specimens were brought
  to me for inspection.” The lake lies to the south-east of the
  present city.—H. C.] A small lake is marked by D’Anville, close to
  Kien-ch’ang, under the name of _Gechoui-tang_. The large quantities
  of gold derived from the Kin-sha Kiang, and the abundance of musk
  in that vicinity, are testified to by Martini. The Lake mentioned
  by Polo as existing in the territory of Yachi is no doubt the
  _Tien-chi_, the Great Lake on the shore of which the city of
  Yun-nan stands, and from which boats make their way by canals along
  the walls and streets. Its circumference, according to Martini, is
  500 _li_. The cut (p. 68), from Garnier, shows this lake as seen
  from a villa on its banks. [Devéria (p. 129) quotes this passage
  from the _Yuen-shi-lei pien_: “Yachi, of which the _U-man_ or Black
  Barbarians made their capital, is surrounded by Lake _Tien-chi_ on
  three sides.” Tien-chi is one of the names of Lake Kwen-ming, on
  the shore of which is built Yun-nan fu.—H. C.]

  Returning now to the Karájang of the Mongols, or Carajan, as Polo
  writes it, we shall find that the latter distinguishes this great
  province, which formerly, he says, included seven kingdoms, into
  two Mongol Governments, the seat of one being at Yachi, which we
  have seen to be Yun-nan fu, and that of the other at a city to
  which he gives the name of the Province, and which we shall find
  to be the existing Ta-li fu. Great confusion has been created in
  most of the editions by a distinction in the form of the name as
  applied to these two governments. Thus Ramusio prints the province
  under Yachi as _Carajan_, and that under Ta-li as _Carazan_, whilst
  Marsden, following out his system for the conversion of Ramusio’s
  orthography, makes the former _Karaian_ and the latter _Karazan_.
  Pauthier prints _Caraian_ all through, a fact so far valuable as
  showing that his texts make no distinction between the names of
  the two governments, but the form impedes the recognition of the
  old Mongol nomenclature. I have no doubt that the name all through
  should be read _Carajan_, and on this I have acted. In the Geog.
  Text we find the name given at the end of ch. xlvii. _Caragian_,
  in ch. xlviii. as _Carajan_, in ch. xlix. as _Caraian_, thus
  just reversing the distinction made by Marsden. The Crusca has
  _Charagia(n)_ all through.

  The name then was _Ḳará-jáng_, in which the first element was the
  Mongol or Turki _Ḳárá_, “Black.” For we find in another passage of
  Rashid the following information:[3]—“To the south-west of Cathay
  is the country called by the Chinese _Dailiu_ or ‘Great Realm,’ and
  by the Mongols _Ḳarájáng_, in the language of India and Kashmir
  _Ḳandar_, and by us _Ḳandahár_. This country, which is of vast
  extent, is bounded on one side by Tibet and Tangut, and on others
  by Mongolia, Cathay, and the country of the Gold-Teeth. The King
  of Ḳarajang uses the title of _Mahárá_, _i.e._ Great King. The
  capital is called Yachi, and there the Council of Administration
  is established. Among the inhabitants of this country some are
  black, and others are white; these latter are called by the Mongols
  _Chaghán-Jáng_ (‘White Jang’).” _Jang_ has not been explained;
  but probably it may have been a Tibetan term adopted by the
  Mongols, and the colours may have applied to their clothing. The
  dominant race at the Mongol invasion seems to have been Shans;[4]
  and black jackets are the characteristic dress of the Shans whom
  one sees in Burma in modern times. The Kara-jang and Chaghan-jang
  appear to correspond also to the _U-man_ and _Pe-man_, or Black
  Barbarians and White Barbarians, who are mentioned by Chinese
  authorities as conquered by the Mongols. It would seem from one of
  Pauthier’s Chinese quotations (p. 388), that the Chaghan-jang were
  found in the vicinity of Li-kiang fu. (_D’Ohsson_, II. 317; _J.
  R. Geog. Soc._ III. 294.) [Dr. Bretschneider (_Med. Res._ I. p.
  184) says that in the description of Yun-nan, in the _Yuen-shi_,
  “_Cara-jang_ and _Chagan-jang_ are rendered by _Wu-man_ and
  _Po-man_ (Black and White Barbarians). But in the biographies of
  _Djao-a-k’o-p’an_, _A-r-szelan_ (_Yuen-shi_, ch. cxxiii.), and
  others, these tribes are mentioned under the names of _Ha-la-djang_
  and _Ch’a-han-djang_, as the Mongols used to call them; and in the
  biography of _Wu-liang-ho t’ai_, [Uriang kadai], the conqueror of
  Yun-nan, it is stated that the capital of the Black Barbarians was
  called _Yach’i_. It is described there as a city surrounded by
  lakes from three sides.”—H. C.]

  [Illustration: A Saracen of Carajan, being a portrait of a
    Mahomedan Mullah in Western Yun-nan. (From Garnier’s Work.)

    “=Les sunt des plosors maineres, car il hi a jens qe aorent
    Maomet.=”]

  Regarding Rashiduddin’s application of the name _Ḳandahár_ or
  Gandhára to Yun-nan, and curious points connected therewith, I must
  refer to a paper of mine in the _J. R. A. Society_ (N.S. IV. 356).
  But I may mention that in the ecclesiastical translation of the
  classical localities of Indian Buddhism to Indo-China, which is
  current in Burma, Yun-nan represents Gandhára,[5] and is still so
  styled in state documents (_Gandálarít_).

  What has been said of the supposed name _Caraian_ disposes, I
  trust, of the fancies which have connected the origin of the
  _Karens_ of Burma with it. More groundless still is M. Pauthier’s
  deduction of the _Talains_ of Pegu (as the Burmese call them) from
  the people of Ta-li, who fled from Kúblái’s invasion.

  NOTE 2.—The existence of Nestorians in this remote province is
  very notable [see _Bonin, J. As._ XV. 1900, pp. 589–590.—H. C.];
  and also the early prevalence of Mahomedanism, which Rashiduddin
  intimates in stronger terms. “All the inhabitants of Yachi,” he
  says, “are Mahomedans.” This was no doubt an exaggeration, but the
  Mahomedans seem always to have continued to be an important body in
  Yun-nan up to our own day. In 1855 began their revolt against the
  imperial authority, which for a time resulted in the establishment
  of their independence in Western Yun-nan under a chief whom they
  called Sultan Suleiman. A proclamation in remarkably good Arabic,
  announcing the inauguration of his reign, appears to have been
  circulated to Mahomedans in foreign states, and a copy of it some
  years ago found its way through the Nepalese agent at L’hasa, into
  the hands of Colonel Ramsay, the British Resident at Katmandu.[6]

  NOTE 3.—Wheat grows as low as Ava, but there also it is not used by
  natives for bread, only for confectionery and the like. The same
  is the case in Eastern China. (See ch. xxvi. note 4, and _Middle
  Kingdom_, II. 43.)

  NOTE 4.—The word _piccoli_ is supplied, doubtfully, in lieu of
  an unknown symbol. If correct, then we should read “24 piccoli
  _each_,” for this was about the equivalent of a grosso. This is the
  first time Polo mentions cowries, which he calls _porcellani_.
  This might have been rendered by the corresponding vernacular name
  “_Pig-shells_,” applied to certain shells of that genus (_Cypraea_)
  in some parts of England. It is worthy of note that as the name
  _porcellana_ has been transferred from these shells to China-ware,
  so the word _pig_ has been in Scotland applied to crockery; whether
  the process has been analogous, I cannot say.

  Klaproth states that Yun-nan is the only country of China in
  which cowries had continued in use, though in ancient times they
  were more generally diffused. According to him 80 cowries were
  equivalent to 6 _cash_, or a half-penny. About 1780 in Eastern
  Bengal 80 cowries were worth ⅜th of a penny, and some 40 years ago,
  when Prinsep compiled his tables in Calcutta (where cowries were
  still in use a few years ago, if they are not now), 80 cowries were
  worth ³⁄₁₀ of a penny.

  At the time of the Mahomedan conquest of Bengal, early in the 13th
  century, they found the currency exclusively composed of cowries,
  aided perhaps by bullion in large transactions, but with no coined
  money. In remote districts this continued to modern times. When
  the Hon. Robert Lindsay went as Resident and Collector to Silhet
  about 1778, cowries constituted nearly the whole currency of the
  Province. The yearly revenue amounted to 250,000 rupees, and this
  was entirely paid in cowries at the rate of 5120 to the rupee. It
  required large warehouses to contain them, and when the year’s
  collection was complete a large fleet of boats to transport them to
  Dacca. Before Lindsay’s time it had been the custom to _count_ the
  whole before embarking them! Down to 1801 the Silhet revenue was
  entirely collected in cowries, but by 1813, the whole was realised
  in specie. (_Thomas_, in _J. R. A. S._ N.S. II. 147; _Lives of the
  Lindsays_, III. 169, 170.)

  Klaproth’s statement has ceased to be correct. Lieutenant Garnier
  found cowries nowhere in use north of Luang Prabang; and among
  the Kakhyens in Western Yun-nan these shells are used only for
  ornament. [However, Mr. E. H. Parker says (_China Review_, XXVI. p.
  106) that the porcelain money still circulates in the Shan States,
  and that he saw it there himself.—H. C.]

  brine-well to the N.E. of Yaogan (W.N.W. of the city of Yun-nan),
  which supplied the whole country round.

  NOTE 6.—Two particulars appearing in these latter paragraphs are
  alluded to by Rashiduddin in giving a brief account of the overland
  route from India to China, which is unfortunately very obscure:

  meat_ and worship images, _and have no shame respecting their
  wives_.” (_Elliot_, I. p. 73.)

[1] [Baber writes (p. 107): “The river is never called locally by
    any other name than _Kin-ho_, or ‘Gold River.’[A] The term
    _Kin-sha-Kiang_ should in strictness be confined to the Tibetan
    course of the stream; as applied to other parts it is a mere book
    name. There is no great objection to its adoption, except that it
    is unintelligible to the inhabitants of the banks, and is liable
    to mislead travellers in search of indigenous information, but
    at any rate it should not be supposed to asperse Marco Polo’s
    accuracy. _Gold River_ is the local name from the junction of the
    Yalung to about P’ing-shan; below P’ing-shan it is known by various
    designations, but the Ssu-ch’uanese naturally call it ‘the River,’
    or, by contrast with its affluents, the ‘Big River’ (_Ta-ho_).” I
    imagine that Baber here makes a slight mistake, and that they use
    the name _kiang_, and not _ho_, for the river.—H. C.]

    [Mr. Rockhill remarks (_Land of the Lamas_, p. 196 note) that
    “Marco Polo speaks of the Yang-tzŭ as the _Brius_, and Orazio
    della Penna calls it _Biciu_, both words representing the Tibetan
    _Dré ch’u_. This last name has been frequently translated ‘Cow
    yak River,’ but this is certainly not its meaning, as cow yak is
    _dri-mo_, never pronounced _dré_, and unintelligible without the
    suffix, _mo_. _Dré_ may mean either mule, dirty, or rice, but as
    I have never seen the word written, I cannot decide on any of
    these terms, all of which have exactly the same pronunciation.
    The Mongols call it _Murus osu_, and in books this is sometimes
    changed to _Murui osu_, ‘Tortuous river.’ The Chinese call it
    _Tung t’ien ho_, ‘River of all Heaven.’ The name _Kin-sha kiang_,
    ‘River of Golden Sand,’ is used for it from Bat’ang to Sui-fu, or
    thereabouts.” The general name for the river is _Ta-Kiang_ (Great
    River), or simply _Kiang_, in contradistinction to _Ho_, for
    _Hwang-Ho_ (Yellow River) in Northern China.—H. C.]

    or Southern was the leading power. Hence the name Nan-Chao ... it
    is hardly necessary for me to say that _chao_ or _kyiao_ is still

                             CHAPTER XLIX.

         CONCERNING A FURTHER PART OF THE PROVINCE OF CARAJAN.


After leaving that city of Yachi of which I have been speaking, and
travelling ten days towards the west, you come to another capital
city which is still in the province of Carajan, and is itself called
Carajan. The people are Idolaters and subject to the Great Kaan; and
the King is COGACHIN, who is a son of the Great Kaan.{1}

In this country gold-dust is found in great quantities; that is to say
in the rivers and lakes, whilst in the mountains gold is also found in
pieces of larger size. Gold is indeed so abundant that they give one
_saggio_ of gold for only six of the same weight in silver. And for
small change they use porcelain shells as I mentioned before. These are
not found in the country, however, but are brought from India.{2}

In this province are found snakes and great serpents of such vast size
as to strike fear into those who see them, and so hideous that the very
account of them must excite the wonder of those to hear it. I will tell
you how long and big they are.

You may be assured that some of them are ten paces in length; some are
more and some less. And in bulk they are equal to a great cask, for the
bigger ones are about ten palms in girth. They have two forelegs near
the head, but for foot nothing but a claw like the claw of a hawk or
that of a lion. The head is very big, and the eyes are bigger than a
great loaf of bread. The mouth is large enough to swallow a man whole,
and is garnished with great [pointed] teeth. And in short they are so
fierce-looking and so hideously ugly, that every man and beast must
stand in fear and trembling of them. There are also smaller ones, such
as of eight paces long, and of five, and of one pace only.

The way in which they are caught is this. You must know that by day
they live underground because of the great heat, and in the night they
go out to feed, and devour every animal they can catch. They go also to
drink at the rivers and lakes and springs. And their weight is so great
that when they travel in search of food or drink, as they do by night,
the tail makes a great furrow in the soil as if a full ton of liquor
had been dragged along. Now the huntsmen who go after them take them
by certain gyn which they set in the track over which the serpent has
past, knowing that the beast will come back the same way. They plant a
stake deep in the ground and fix on the head of this a sharp blade of
steel made like a razor or a lance-point, and then they cover the whole
with sand so that the serpent cannot see it. Indeed the huntsman plants
several such stakes and blades on the track. On coming to the spot the
beast strikes against the iron blade with such force that it enters his
breast and rives him up to the navel, so that he dies on the spot [and
the crows on seeing the brute dead begin to caw, and then the huntsmen
know that the serpent is dead and come in search of him].

This then is the way these beasts are taken. Those who take them
proceed to extract the gall from the inside, and this sells at a great
price; for you must know it furnishes the material for a most precious
medicine. Thus if a person is bitten by a mad dog, and they give him
but a small pennyweight of this medicine to drink, he is cured in a
moment. Again if a woman is hard in labour they give her just such
another dose and she is delivered at once. Yet again if one has any
disease like the itch, or it may be worse, and applies a small quantity
of this gall he shall speedily be cured. So you see why it sells at
such a high price.

[Illustration: “Riding long like Frenchmen.”

  “=Et encore sachié qe ceste gens chevauchent lonc come franchois.=”]

They also sell the flesh of this serpent, for it is excellent eating,
and the people are very fond of it. And when these serpents are very
hungry, sometimes they will seek out the lairs of lions or bears or
other large wild beasts, and devour their cubs, without the sire
and dam being able to prevent it. Indeed if they catch the big ones
themselves they devour them too; they can make no resistance.{3}

In this province also are bred large and excellent horses which are
taken to India for sale. And you must know that the people dock two
or three joints of the tail from their horses, to prevent them from
flipping their riders, a thing which they consider very unseemly.
They ride long like Frenchmen, and wear armour of boiled leather, and
carry spears and shields and arblasts, and all their quarrels are
poisoned.{4} [And I was told as a fact that many persons, especially
those meditating mischief, constantly carry this poison about with
them, so that if by any chance they should be taken, and be threatened
with torture, to avoid this they swallow the poison and so die
speedily. But princes who are aware of this keep ready dog’s dung,
which they cause the criminal instantly to swallow, to make him vomit
the poison. And thus they manage to cure those scoundrels.]

[Illustration: The Lake of Tali (Carajan of Polo) from the Northern
  End.]

[Illustration: Suspension Bridge, neighbourhood of Tali.]

I will tell you of a wicked thing they used to do before the Great Kaan
conquered them. If it chanced that a man of fine person or noble birth,
or some other quality that recommended him, came to lodge with those
people, then they would murder him by poison, or otherwise. And this
they did, not for the sake of plunder, but because they believed that
in this way the goodly favour and wisdom and repute of the murdered
man would cleave to the house where he was slain. And in this manner
many were murdered before the country was conquered by the Great Kaan.
But since his conquest, some 35 years ago, these crimes and this evil
practice have prevailed no more; and this through dread of the Great
Kaan who will not permit such things.{5}


  NOTE 1.—There can be no doubt that this second chief city of
  Carajan is TALI-FU, which was the capital of the Shan Kingdom
  called by the Chinese Nan-Chao. This kingdom had subsisted in
  Yun-nan since 738, and probably had embraced the upper part of
  the Irawadi Valley. For the Chinese tell us it was also called
  _Maung_, and it probably was identical with the Shan Kingdom of
  Muang Maorong or of _Pong_, of which Captain Pemberton procured a
  Chronicle. [In A.D. 650, the Ai-Lao, the most ancient name by which
  the Shans were known to the Chinese, became the Nan-Chao. The Mêng
  family ruled the country from the 7th century; towards the middle
  of the 8th century, P’i-lo-ko, who is the real founder of the Thai
  kingdom of Nan-Chao, received from the Chinese the title of King of
  Yun-Nan and made T’ai-ho, 15 _lis_ south of Ta-li, his residence;
  he died in 748. In A.D. 938, Twan Sze-ying, of an old Chinese
  family, took Ta-li and established there an independent kingdom.
  In 1115 embassies with China were exchanged, and the Emperor
  conferred (1119) upon Twan Ch’êng-yn the title of King of Ta-li
  (_Ta-li Kwo Wang_). Twan Siang-hing was the last king of Ta-li
  (1239–1251). In 1252 the Kingdom of Nan-Chao was destroyed by the
  Mongols; the Emperor She Tsu (Kúblái) gave the title of Maháraja
  (_Mo-ho Lo-tso_) to Twan Hing-che (son of Twan Siang-hing), who had
  fled to Yun-Nan fu and was captured there. Afterwards (1261) the
  Twan are known as the eleven _Tsung-Kwan_ (governors); the last of
  them, Twan Ming, was made a prisoner by an army sent by the Ming
  Emperors, and sent to Nan-King (1381). (_E. H. Parker, Early Laos
  and China, China Review_, XIX. and the _Old Thai or Shan Empire of
  Western Yun-Nan_, _Ibid._, XX.; _E. Rocher, Hist. des Princes du
  Yunnan, T’oung Pao_, 1899; _E. Chavannes, Une Inscription du roy.
  de Nan Tchao, J.A._, November–December, 1900; _M. Tchang, Tableau
  des Souverains de Nan-Tchao, Bul. Ecole Franç. d’Ext. Orient_, I.
  No. 4.)—H. C.] The city of Ta-li was taken by Kúblái in 1253–1254.
  The circumstance that it was known to the invaders (as appeals from
  Polo’s statement) by the name of the province is an indication of
  the fact that it was the capital of Carajan before the conquest.
  [“That _Yachi_ and _Carajan_ represent Yünnan-fu and Tali, is
  proved by topographical and other evidence of an overwhelming
  nature. I venture to add one more proof, which seems to have been
  overlooked.

  “If there is a natural feature which must strike any visitor to
  those two cities, it is that they both lie on the shore of notable
  lakes, of so large an extent as to be locally called seas; and for
  the comparison, it should be remembered that the inhabitants of the
  Yünnan province have easy access to the ocean by the Red River, or
  Sung Ka. Now, although Marco does not circumstantially specify the
  fact of these cities lying on large bodies of water, yet in both
  cases, two or three sentences further on, will be found mention of
  lakes; in the case of Yachi, ‘a lake of a good hundred miles in
  compass’—by no means an unreasonable estimate.

  “Tali-fu is renowned as the strongest hold of Western Yünnan, and
  it certainly must have been impregnable to bow and spear. From
  the western margin of its majestic lake, which lies approximately
  north and south, rises a sloping plain of about three miles average
  breadth, closed in by the huge wall of the Tien-tsang Mountains. In
  the midst of this plain stands the city, the lake at its feet, the
  snowy summits at its back. On either flank, at about twelve and six
  miles distance respectively, are situated Shang-Kuan and Hsia-Kuan
  (upper and lower passes), two strongly fortified towns guarding the
  confined strip between mountain and lake; for the plain narrows at
  the two extremities, and is intersected by a river at both points.”
  (_Baber_, _Travels_, 155.)—H. C.]

  The distance from Yachi to this city of Karajang is ten days,
  and this corresponds well with the distance from Yun-nan fu to
  Tali-fu. For we find that, of the three Burmese Embassies whose
  itineraries are given by Burney, one makes 7 marches between those
  cities, specifying 2 of them as double marches, therefore equal to
  9, whilst the other two make 11 marches; Richthofen’s information
  gives 12. Ta-li-fu is a small old city overlooking its large lake
  (about 24 miles long by 6 wide), and an extensive plain devoid of
  trees. Lofty mountains rise on the south side of the city. The Lake
  appears to communicate with the Mekong, and the story goes, no
  doubt fabulous, that boats have come up to Ta-li from the Ocean.
  [Captain Gill (II. pp. 299–300) writes: “Ta-li fu is an ancient
  city ... it is the Carajan of Marco Polo.... Marco’s description
  of the lake of Yun-Nan may be perfectly well applied to the Lake
  of Ta-li.... The fish were particularly commended to our notice,
  though we were told that there were no oysters in this lake, as
  there are said to be in that of Yun-Nan; if the latter statement be
  true, it would illustrate Polo’s account of another lake somewhere
  in these regions in which are found pearls (which are white but not
  round).”—H. C.]

  Ta-li fu was recently the capital of Sultan Suleiman [Tu Wen-siu].
  It was reached by Lieutenant Garnier in a daring détour by the
  north of Yun-nan, but his party were obliged to leave in haste on
  the second day after their arrival. The city was captured by the
  Imperial officers in 1873, when a horrid massacre of the Mussulmans
  took place [19th January]. The Sultan took poison, but his head was
  cut off and sent to Peking. Momein fell soon after [10th June], and
  the _Panthé_ kingdom is ended.

  We see that Polo says the King ruling for Kúblái at this city
  was a son of the Kaan, called COGACHIN, whilst he told us in
  the last chapter that the King reigning at Yachi was also a son
  of the Kaan, called ESSENTIMUR. It is probably a mere lapsus or
  error of dictation calling the latter a son of the Kaan, for in
  ch. li. _infra_, this prince is correctly described as the Kaan’s
  grandson. Rashiduddin tells us that Kúblái had given his son
  HUKÁJI (or perhaps _Hogáchi_, _i.e._ Cogachin) the government of
  Karajang,[1] and that after the death of this Prince the government
  was continued to his son ISENTIMUR. Klaproth gives the date of the
  latter’s nomination from the Chinese Annals as 1280. It is not easy
  to reconcile Marco’s statements perfectly with a knowledge of these
  facts; but we may suppose that, in speaking of Cogachin as ruling
  at Karajang (or Tali-fu) and Esentimur at Yachi, he describes
  things as they stood when his visit occurred, whilst in the second
  reference to “Sentemur’s” being King in the province and his father
  dead, he speaks from later knowledge. This interpretation would
  confirm what has been already deduced from other circumstances,
  that his visit to Yun-nan was prior to 1280. (_Pemberton’s Report
  on the Eastern Frontier_, 108 _seqq._; _Quat. Rashid._ pp.
  lxxxix-xc.; _Journ. Asiat._ sér. II. vol. i.)

  NOTE 2.—[Captain Gill writes (II. p. 302): “There are said to be
  very rich gold and silver mines within a few days’ journey of the
  city” (of Ta-li). Dr. Anderson says (_Mandalay to Momien_, p. 203):
  “Gold is brought to Momein from Yonephin and Sherg-wan villages,
  fifteen days’ march to the north-east; but no information could
  be obtained as to the quantity found. It is also brought in leaf,
  which is sent to Burma, where it is in extensive demand.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—It cannot be doubted that Marco’s serpents here are
  crocodiles, in spite of his strange mistakes about their having
  only two feet and one claw on each, and his imperfect knowledge of
  their aquatic habits. He may have seen only a mutilated specimen.
  But there is no mistaking the hideous ferocity of the countenance,
  and the “eyes bigger than a fourpenny loaf,” as Ramusio has it.
  Though the actual _eye_ of the crocodile does not bear this
  comparison, the prominent _orbits_ do, especially in the case of
  the _Ghaṛiyál_ of the Ganges, and form one of the most repulsive
  features of the reptile’s physiognomy. In fact, its presence on the
  surface of an Indian river is often recognisable only by three dark
  knobs rising above the surface, viz. the snout and the two orbits.
  And there is some foundation for what our author says of the
  animal’s habits, for the crocodile does sometimes frequent holes
  at a distance from water, of which a striking instance is within
  my own recollection (in which the deep furrowed track also was a
  notable circumstance).

  The Cochin Chinese are very fond of crocodile’s flesh, and there is
  or was a regular export of this dainty for their use from Kamboja.
  I have known it eaten by certain classes in India. (_J. R. G. S._
  XXX. 193.)

  The term _serpent_ is applied by many old writers to crocodiles and
  the like, _e.g._ by Odoric, and perhaps allusively by Shakspeare
  (“_Where’s my Serpent of Old Nile?_”). Mr. Fergusson tells me he
  was once much struck with the _snake-like_ motion of a group of
  crocodiles hastily descending to the water from a high sand-bank,
  without apparent use of the limbs, when surprised by the approach
  of a boat.[2]

  Matthioli says the gall of the crocodile surpasses all medicines
  for the removal of pustules and the like from the eyes. Vincent of
  Beauvais mentions the same, besides many other medical uses of the
  reptile’s carcass, including a very unsavoury cosmetic. (_Matt._ p.
  245; _Spec. Natur._ Lib. XVII. c. 106, 108.)

  [“According to Chinese notions, Han Yü, the St. Patrick of China,
  having persuaded the alligators in China that he was all-powerful,
  induced the stupid saurians to migrate to Ngo Hu or ‘Alligators’
  Lake’ in the Kwang-tung province.” (_North-China Herald_, 5th July,
  1895, p. 5.)

  Alligators have been found in 1878 at Wu-hu and at Chen-kiang
  (Ngan-hwei and Kiang-Su). (See _A. A. Fauvel, Alligators in China_,
  in _Jour. N. China B. R. A. S._ XIII. 1879, 1–36.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 4.—I think the _great_ horses must be an error, though running
  through all the texts, and that _grant quantité de chevaus_
  was probably intended. Valuable _ponies_ are produced in those
  regions, but I have never heard of large horses, and Martini’s
  testimony is to like effect (p. 141). Nor can I hear of any race in
  those regions in modern times that uses what we should call long
  stirrups. It is true that the Tartars rode _very short_—“_brevissimas
  habent strepas_,” as Carpini says (643); and the Kirghiz Kazaks now
  do the same. Both Burmese and Shans ride what we should call short;
  and Major Sladen observes of the people on the western border of
  Yun-nan: “Kachyens and Shans ride on ordinary Chinese saddles.
  The stirrups are of the usual average length, but the saddles are
  so constructed as to rise at least a foot above the pony’s back.”
  He adds with reference to another point in the text: “I noticed a
  few Shan ponies _with docked tails_. But the more general practice
  is to loop up the tail in a knot, the object being to protect the
  rider, or rather his clothes, from the dirt with which they would
  otherwise be spattered from the flipping of the animal’s tail.”
  (_MS. Notes._)

  [After Yung-ch’ang, Captain Gill writes (II. p. 356): “The manes
  were hogged and the tails cropped of a great many of the ponies
  these men were riding; but there were none of the docked tails
  mentioned by Marco Polo.”—H. C.]

  Armour of boiled leather—“_armes cuiracés de cuir bouilli_”; so
  Pauthier’s text; the material so often mentioned in mediæval
  costume; _e.g._ in the leggings of Sir Thopas:—

      “His jambeux were of cuirbouly,
       His swerdës sheth of ivory,
         His helme of latoun bright.”

  But the reading of the G. Text which is “_cuir de bufal_,” is
  probably the right one. Some of the Miau-tzŭ of Kweichau are
  described as wearing armour of buffalo-leather overlaid with
  iron plates. (_Ritter_, IV. 768–776.) Arblasts or crossbows are
  still characteristic weapons of many of the wilder tribes of this
  region; _e.g._ of some of the Singphos, of the Mishmis of Upper
  Assam, of the Lu-tzŭ of the valley of the Lukiang, of tribes of
  the hills of Laos, of the Stiens of Cambodia, and of several of
  the Miau-tzŭ tribes of the interior of China. We give a cut copied
  from a Chinese work on the Miau-tzŭ of Kweichau in Dr. Lockhart’s
  possession, which shows _three_ little men of the Sang-Miau tribe
  of Kweichau combining to mend a crossbow, and a chief with _armes
  cuiracés_ and _jambeux_ also. [The cut (p. 83) is well explained by
  this passage of _Baber’s Travels_ among the Lolos (p. 71): “They
  make their own swords, three and a half to five spans long, with
  square heads, and have bows which it takes three men to draw, but
  no muskets.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 5.—I have nowhere met with a _precise_ parallel to this
  remarkable superstition, but the following piece of Folk-Lore has a
  considerable analogy to it. This extraordinary custom is ascribed
  by Ibn Fozlan to the Bulgarians of the Volga: “If they find a man
  endowed with special intelligence then they say: ‘This man should
  serve our Lord God;’ and so they take him, run a noose round his
  neck and hang him on a tree, where they leave him till the corpse
  falls to pieces.” This is precisely what Sir Charles Wood did with
  the Indian Corps of Engineers;—doubtless on the same principle.

  Archbishop Trench, in a fine figure, alludes to a belief prevalent
  among the Polynesian Islanders, “that the strength and valour of
  the warriors whom they have slain in battle passes into themselves,
  as their rightful inheritance.” (_Fraehn, Wolga-Bulgaren_, p. 50;
  _Studies in the Gospels_, p. 22; see also _Lubbock_, 457.)

  There is some analogy also to the story Polo tells, in the
  curious Sindhi tradition, related by Burton, of Bahá-ul-haḳḳ, the
  famous saint of Multán. When he visited his disciples at Tatta
  they plotted his death, in order to secure the blessings of his
  perpetual presence. The people of Multán are said to have murdered
  two celebrated saints with the same view, and the Hazáras to “make
  a point of killing and burying in their own country any stranger
  indiscreet enough to commit a miracle or show any particular sign
  of sanctity.” The like practice is ascribed to the rude Moslem of
  Gilghit; and such allegations must have been current in Europe, for
  they are the motive of _Southey’s St. Romuald_:

            “‘But,’ quoth the Traveller, ‘wherefore did he leave
      A flock that knew his saintly worth so well?’
                •       •       •       •       •
            “‘Why, Sir,’ the Host replied,
      ‘We thought perhaps that he might one day leave us;
             And then, should strangers have
             The good man’s grave,
      A loss like that would naturally grieve us;
             For he’ll be made a saint of, to be sure.
             Therefore we thought it prudent to secure
          His relics while we might;
          And so we meant to strangle him one night.’”

  Barbarians, as the Chinese call them; and Monseigneur Pinchon told
  me that, amongst other pleasing theories, they were possessed of
  the belief that if they poisoned a rich man, his wealth would
  accrue to the poisoner; that, therefore, the hospitable custom

                              CHAPTER L.

                 CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF ZARDANDAN.


When you have left Carajan and have travelled five days westward, you
find a province called ZARDANDAN. The people are Idolaters and subject
to the Great Kaan. The capital city is called VOCHAN.{1}

The people of this country all have their teeth gilt; or rather every
man covers his teeth with a sort of golden case made to fit them, both
the upper teeth and the under. The men do this, but not the women.{2}
[The men also are wont to gird their arms and legs with bands or
fillets pricked in black, and it is done thus; they take five needles
joined together, and with these they prick the flesh till the blood
comes, and then they rub in a certain black colouring stuff, and this
is perfectly indelible. It is considered a piece of elegance and the
sign of gentility to have this black band.] The men are all gentlemen
in their fashion, and do nothing but go to the wars, or go hunting and
hawking. The ladies do all the business, aided by the slaves who have
been taken in war.{3}

And when one of their wives has been delivered of a child, the infant
is washed and swathed, and then the woman gets up and goes about her
household affairs, whilst the husband takes to bed with the child by
his side, and so keeps his bed for 40 days; and all the kith and kin
come to visit him and keep up a great festivity. They do this because,
say they, the woman has had a hard bout of it, and ’tis but fair the
man should have his share of suffering.{4}

They eat all kinds of meat, both raw and cooked, and they eat rice with
their cooked meat as their fashion is. Their drink is wine made of rice
and spices, and excellent it is. Their money is gold, and for small
change they use pig-shells. And I can tell you they give one weight of
gold for only five of silver; for there is no silver-mine within five
months’ journey. And this induces merchants to go thither carrying a
large supply of silver to change among that people. And as they have
only five weights of silver to give for one of fine gold, they make
immense profits by their exchange business in that country.{5}

These people have neither idols nor churches, but worship the
progenitor of their family, “for ’tis he,” say they, “from whom we
have all sprung.”{6} They have no letters or writing; and ’tis no
wonder, for the country is wild and hard of access, full of great
woods and mountains which ’tis impossible to pass, the air in summer
is so impure and bad; and any foreigners attempting it would die for
certain.{7} When these people have any business transactions with one
another, they take a piece of stick, round or square, and split it,
each taking half. And on either half they cut two or three notches. And
when the account is settled the debtor receives back the other half of
the stick from the creditor.{8}

And let me tell you that in all those three provinces that I have
been speaking of, to wit Carajan, Vochan, and Yachi, there is never a
leech. But when any one is ill they send for their magicians, that is
to say the Devil-conjurors and those who are the keepers of the idols.
When these are come the sick man tells what ails him, and then the
conjurors incontinently begin playing on their instruments and singing
and dancing; and the conjurors dance to such a pitch that at last one
of them shall fall to the ground lifeless, like a dead man. And then
the devil entereth into his body. And when his comrades see him in this
plight they begin to put questions to him about the sick man’s ailment.
And he will reply: “Such or such a spirit hath been meddling with the
man,{9} for that he hath angered the spirit and done it some despite.”
Then they say: “We pray thee to pardon him, and to take of his blood
or of his goods what thou wilt in consideration of thus restoring him
to health.” And when they have so prayed, the malignant spirit that is
in the body of the prostrate man will (mayhap) answer: “The sick man
hath also done great despite unto such another spirit, and that one is
so ill-disposed that it will not pardon him on any account;”—this at
least is the answer they get, an the patient be like to die. But if he
is to get better the answer will be that they are to bring two sheep,
or may be three; and to brew ten or twelve jars of drink, very costly
and abundantly spiced.{10} Moreover it shall be announced that the
sheep must be all black-faced, or of some other particular colour as it
may hap; and then all those things are to be offered in sacrifice to
such and such a spirit whose name is given.{11} And they are to bring
so many conjurors, and so many ladies, and the business is to be done
with a great singing of lauds, and with many lights, and store of good
perfumes. That is the sort of answer they get if the patient is to get
well. And then the kinsfolk of the sick man go and procure all that has
been commanded, and do as has been bidden, and the conjuror who had
uttered all that gets on his legs again.

So they fetch the sheep of the colour prescribed, and slaughter them,
and sprinkle the blood over such places as have been enjoined, in
honour and propitiation of the spirit. And the conjurors come, and the
ladies, in the number that was ordered, and when all are assembled and
everything is ready, they begin to dance and play and sing in honour
of the spirit. And they take flesh-broth and drink and lign-aloes, and
a great number of lights, and go about hither and thither, scattering
the broth and the drink and the meat also. And when they have done this
for a while, again shall one of the conjurors fall flat and wallow
there foaming at the mouth, and then the others will ask if he have
yet pardoned the sick man? And sometimes he shall answer yea! and
sometimes he shall answer no! And if the answer be _no_, they shall be
told that something or other has to be done all over again, and then
he will be pardoned; so this they do. And when all that the spirit has
commanded has been done with great ceremony, then it shall be announced
that the man is pardoned and shall be speedily cured. So when they at
length receive such a reply, they announce that it is all made up with
the spirit, and that he is propitiated, and they fall to eating and
drinking with great joy and mirth, and he who had been lying lifeless
on the ground gets up and takes his share. So when they have all eaten
and drunken, every man departs home. And presently the sick man gets
sound and well.{12}

Now that I have told you of the customs and naughty ways of that
people, we will have done talking of them and their province, and I
will tell you about others, all in regular order and succession.


  NOTE 1.—[Baber writes (_Travels_, p. 171) when arriving to the
  Lan-tsang kiang (Mekong River): “We were now on the border-line
  between Carajan and Zardandan: ‘When you have travelled five days
  you find a province called Zardandan,’ says Messer Marco, precisely
  the actual number of stages from Tali-fu to the present boundary
  of Yung-ch’ang. That this river must have been the demarcation
  between the two provinces is obvious; one glance into that deep
  rift, the only exit from which is by painful worked artificial
  zigzags which, under the most favourable conditions, cannot be
  called safe, will satisfy the most sceptical geographer. The exact
  statement of distance is a proof that Marco entered the territory
  of Yung-ch’ang.” Captain Gill says (II. p. 343–344) that the five
  marches of Marco Polo “would be very long ones. Our journey was
  eight days, but it might easily have been done in seven, as the
  first march to Hsia-Kuan was not worthy of the name. The Grosvenor
  expedition made eleven marches with one day’s halt—twelve days
  altogether, and Mr. Margary was nine or ten days on the journey.
  It is true that, by camping out every night, the marches might be
  longer; and, as Polo refers to the crackling of the bamboos in the
  fires, it is highly probable that he found no ‘_fine hostelries_’
  on this route. This is the way the traders still travel in Tibet;
  they march until they are tired, or until they find a nice grassy
  spot; they then off saddles, turn their animals loose, light a
  fire under some adjacent tree, and halt for the night; thus the
  longest possible distance can be performed every day, and the
  five days from Ta-li to Yung-Ch’ang would not be by any means an
  impossibility.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—Ramusio says that both men and women use this gold case.
  There can be no better instance of the accuracy with which Polo is
  generally found to have represented Oriental names, when we recover
  his _real_ representation of them, than this name _Zardandan_. In
  the old Latin editions the name appeared as _Ardandan_, _Arcladam_,
  etc.; in Ramusio as _Cardandan_, correctly enough, only the first
  letter should have been printed Ç. Marsden, carrying out his
  systematic conversion of the Ramusian spelling, made this into
  _Kardandan_, and thus the name became irrecognizable. Klaproth,
  I believe, first showed that the word was simply the Persian
  ZĂR-DANDÁN, “Gold-Teeth,” and produced quotations from Rashiduddin
  mentioning the people in question by that identical name. Indeed
  that historian mentions them several times. Thus: “North-west of
  China is the frontier of Tibet, and of the ZARDANDAN, who lie
  between Tibet and Karájáng. These people cover their teeth with
  a gold case, which they take off when they eat.” They are also
  frequently mentioned in the Chinese annals about this period under
  the same name, viz. _Kin-Chi_, “Gold-Teeth,” and some years after
  Polo’s departure from the East they originated a revolt against the
  Mongol yoke, in which a great number of the imperial troops were
  massacred. (_De Mailla_, IX. 478–479.)

  [Baber writes (p. 159): “In Western Yünnan the betel-nut is chewed
  with prepared lime, colouring the teeth red, and causing a profuse
  expectoration. We first met with the practice near Tali-fu.

  “Is it not possible that the red colour imparted to the teeth by
  the practice of chewing betel with lime may go some way to account
  for the ancient name of this region, ‘Zar-dandan,’ ‘Chin-Ch’ih,’
  or ‘Golden-Teeth’? Betel-chewing is, of course, common all over
  China; but the use of lime is almost unknown and the teeth are not
  necessarily discoloured.

  “In the neighbourhood of Tali, one comes suddenly upon a
  lime-chewing people, and is at once struck with the strange
  red hue of their teeth and gums. That some of the natives used
  formerly to cover their teeth with plates of gold (from which
  practice, mentioned by Marco Polo, and confirmed elsewhere, the
  name is generally derived) can scarcely be considered a myth; but
  the peculiarity remarked by ourselves would have been equally
  noticeable by the early Chinese invaders, and seems not altogether
  unworthy of consideration. It is interesting to find the name
  ‘Chin-Ch’ih’ still in use.

  “When Tu Wên-hsiu sent his ‘Panthay’ mission to England with
  tributary boxes of rock from the Tali Mountains, he described
  himself in his letter ‘as a humble native of the golden-teeth
  country.’”—H. C.]

  _Vochan_ seems undoubtedly to be, as Martini pointed out, the city
  called by the Chinese YUNG-CH’ANG-FU. Some of the old printed
  editions read _Unciam_, _i.e._ Uncham or Unchan, and it is probable
  that either this or _Võcian_, _i.e._ VONCHAN, was the true reading,
  coming very close to the proper name, which is WUNCHEN. (See
  _J. A. S. B._ VI. 547.) [In an itinerary from Ava to Peking, we
  read on the 10th September, 1833: “Slept at the city Wun-tsheng
  (Chinese Yongtchang fú and Burmese _Wun-zen_).” (_Chin. Rep._ IX.
  p. 474.)—Mr. F. W. K. Müller in a study on the Pa-yi language
  from a Chinese manuscript entitled _Hwa-i-yi-yü_ found by Dr. F.
  Hirth in China, and belonging now to the Berlin Royal Library,
  says the proper orthography of the word is _Wan-chang_ in Pa-yi.
  (_T’oung Pao_, III. p. 20.) This helps to find the origin of the
  name _Vochan_.—H. C.] This city has been a Chinese one for several
  centuries, and previous to the late Mahomedan revolt its population
  was almost exclusively Chinese, with only a small mixture of Shans.
  It is now noted for the remarkable beauty and fairness of the
  women. But it is mentioned by Chinese authors as having been in the
  Middle Ages the capital of the Gold-Teeth. These people, according
  to Martini, dwelt chiefly to the north of the city. They used to
  go to worship a huge stone, 100 feet high, at Nan-ngan, and cover
  it annually with gold-leaf. Some additional particulars about the
  Kin-Chi, in the time of the Mongols, will be found in Pauthier’s
  notes (p. 398).

  [In 1274, the Burmese attacked Yung ch’ang, whose inhabitants were
  known under the name of _Kin-Chi_ (Golden-Teeth). (_E. Rocher,
  Princes du Yun-nan_, p. 71.) From the Annals of Momein, translated
  by Mr. E. H. Parker (_China Review_, XX. p. 345), we learn that:
  “In the year 1271, the General of Ta-li was sent on a mission to
  procure the submission of the Burmese, and managed to bring a
  Burmese envoy named Kiai-poh back with him. Four years later Fu
  A-pih, Chief of the Golden-Teeth, was utilised as a guide, which
  so angered the Burmese that they detained Fu A-pih and attacked
  Golden-Teeth: but he managed to bribe himself free. A-ho, Governor
  of the Golden-Teeth, was now sent as a spy, which caused the
  Burmese to advance to the attack once more, but they were driven
  back by Twan Sin-cha-jih. These events led to the Burmese war,”
  which lasted till 1301.

  According to the _Hwang-tsing Chi-kung t’u_ (quoted by Devéria,
  _Front._ p. 130), the _Pei-jen_ were _Kin-chi_, of Pa-y race, and
  were surnamed Min-kia-tzŭ; the Min-kia, according to F. Garnier,
  say that they come from Nan-king, but this is certainly an error
  for the Pei-jen. From another Chinese work, Devéria (p. 169) gives
  this information: The Piao are the Kin-Chi; they submitted to the
  Mongols in the 13th century; they are descended from the people of
  Chu-po or Piao Kwo (Kingdom of Piao), ancient Pegu; P’u-p’iao, in
  a little valley between the Mekong and the Salwen Rivers, was the
  place through which the P’u and the Piao entered China.

  The Chinese geographical work _Fang-yu-ki-yao_ mentions the name
  of Kin-Chi Ch’eng, or city of Kin-Chi, as the ancient denomination
  of Yung-ch’ang. A Chinese Pa-y vocabulary, belonging to Professor
  Devéria, translates Kin-Chi by Wan-Chang (Yung-ch’ang). (_Devéria,
  Front._ p. 128.)—H. C.]

  It has not been determined who are the representatives of these
  Gold-Teeth, who were evidently distinct from the Shans, not
  Buddhist, and without literature. I should think it probable that
  they were _Kakhyens_ or _Singphos_, who, excluding Shans, appear
  to form the greatest body in that quarter, and are closely akin to
  each other, indeed essentially identical in race.[1] The Singphos
  have now extended widely to the west of the Upper Irawadi and
  northward into Assam, but their traditions bring them from the
  borders of Yunnan. The original and still most populous seat of
  the Kakhyen or Singpho race is pointed out by Colonel Hannay in
  the Gulansigung Mountains and the valley of the eastern source of
  the Irawadi. This agrees with Martini’s indication of the seat of
  the Kin-Chi as north of Yung-ch’ang. One of Hannay’s notices of
  Singpho customs should also be compared with the interpolation from
  Ramusio about tattooing: “The men tattoo their limbs slightly, and
  all married females are tattooed on both legs from the ankle to
  the knee, in broad horizontal circular bands. Both sexes also wear
  rings below the knee of fine shreds of rattan varnished black” (p.
  18). These rings appear on the Kakhyen woman in our cut.

  [Illustration: Kakhyens. (From a Photograph.)]

  The only other wild tribe spoken of by Major Sladen as attending
  the markets on the frontier is that of the _Lissus_, already
  mentioned by Lieutenant Garnier (_supra_, ch. xlvii. note 6), and
  who are said to be the most savage and indomitable of the tribes
  in that quarter. Garnier also mentions the Mossos, who are alleged
  once to have formed an independent kingdom about Li-kiang fu.
  Possibly, however, the Gold-Teeth may have become entirely absorbed
  in the Chinese and Shan population.

  The characteristic of casing the teeth in gold should identify the
  tribe did it still exist. But I can learn nothing of the continued
  existence of such a custom among any tribe of the Indo-Chinese
  continent. The insertion of gold studs or spots, which Bürck
  confounds with it, is common enough among Indo-Chinese races,
  but that is quite a different thing. The actual practice of the
  Zardandan is, however, followed by some of the people of Sumatra,
  as both Marsden and Raffles testify: “The great men sometimes
  set their teeth in gold, by casing with a plate of that metal
  the under row ... it is sometimes indented to the shape of the
  teeth, but more usually quite plain. They do not remove it either
  to eat or sleep.” The like custom is mentioned by old travellers
  at Macassar, and with the substitution of _silver_ for gold by
  a modern traveller as existing in Timor; but in both, probably,
  it was a practice of Malay tribes, as in Sumatra. (_Marsden’s
  Sumatra_, 3rd ed., p. 52; _Raffles’s Java_, I. 105; _Bickmore’s
  Ind. Archipelago_.)

  [In his second volume of _The River of Golden Sand_, Captain Gill
  has two chapters (viii. and ix.) with the title: _In the footsteps
  of Marco Polo and of Augustus Margary_ devoted to _The Land of the
  Gold-Teeth_ and _The Marches of the Kingdom of Mien_.—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—This is precisely the account which Lieutenant Garnier
  gives of the people of Laos: “The Laos people are very indolent,
  and when they are not rich enough to possess slaves they make
  over to their women the greatest part of the business of the
  day; and ’tis these latter who not only do all the work of the
  house, but who husk the rice, work in the fields, and paddle the
  canoes. Hunting and fishing are almost the only occupations which
  pertain exclusively to the stronger sex.” (_Notice sur le Voyage
  d’Exploration_, etc., p. 34.)

  NOTE 4.—This highly eccentric practice has been ably illustrated
  and explained by Mr. Tylor, under the name of the _Couvade_, or
  “Hatching,” by which it is known in some of the Béarn districts of
  the Pyrenees, where it formerly existed, as it does still or did
  recently, in some Basque districts of Spain. [In a paper on _La
  Couvade chez les Basques_, published in the _République Française_,
  of 19th January, 1877, and reprinted in _Études de Linguistique et
  d’Ethnographie par A. Hovelacque et Julien Vinson_, Paris, 1878,
  Prof. Vinson quotes the following curious passage from the poem
  in ten cantos, _Luciniade_, by Sacombe, of Carcassonne (Paris and
  Nîmes, 1790):

      “En Amérique, en Corse, et chez l’Ibérien,
       En France même encor chez le Vénarnien,
       Au pays Navarrois, lorsqu’une femme accouche,
       L’épouse sort du lit et le mari se couche;
       Et, quoiqu’il soit très sain et d’esprit et de corps,
       Contre un mal qu’il n’a point l’art unit ses efforts.
       On le met au régime, et notre faux malade,
       Soigné par l’accouchée, en son lit fait _couvade_:
       On ferme avec grand soin portes, volets, rideaux;
       Immobile, on l’oblige à rester sur le dos,
       Pour étouffer son lait, qui gêné dans sa course,
       Pourrait en l’étouffant remonter vers sa source.
       Un mari, dans sa couche, au médecin soumis,
       Reçoit, en cet état, parents, voisins, amis,
       Qui viennent l’exhorter à prendre patience
       Et font des vœux au ciel pour sa convalescence.”

  Professor Vinson, who is an authority on the subject, comes to the
  conclusion that it is not possible to ascribe to the Basques the
  custom of the _couvade_.

  Mr. Tylor writes to me that he “did not quite begin the use of
  this good French word in the sense of the ‘man-child-bed’ as they
  call it in Germany. It occurs in Rochefort, _Iles Antilles_, and
  though Dr. Murray, of the English Dictionary, maintains that it is
  spurious, if so, it is better than any genuine word I know of.”—H.
  C.] “In certain valleys of Biscay,” says Francisque-Michel, “in
  which the popular usages carry us back to the infancy of society,
  the woman immediately after her delivery gets up and attends to the
  cares of the household, whilst the husband takes to bed with the
  tender fledgeling in his arms, and so receives the compliments of
  his neighbours.”

  The nearest people to the Zardandan of whom I find this custom
  elsewhere recorded, is one called _Langszi_,[2] a small tribe of
  aborigines in the department of Wei-ning, in Kweichau, but close
  to the border of Yun-nan: “Their manners and customs are very
  extraordinary. For example, when the wife has given birth to a
  child, the husband remains in the house and holds it in his arms
  for a whole month, not once going out of doors. The wife in the
  mean time does all the work in doors and out, and provides and
  serves up both food and drink for the husband, she only giving suck
  to the child.” I am informed also that, among the Miris on the
  Upper Assam border, the husband on such occasions confines himself
  strictly to the house for forty days after the event.

  The custom of the Couvade has especially and widely prevailed in
  South America, not only among the Carib races of Guiana, of the
  Spanish Main, and (where still surviving) of the West Indies, but
  among many tribes of Brazil and its borders from the Amazons to
  the Plate, and among the Abipones of Paraguay; it also exists or
  has existed among the aborigines of California, in West Africa,
  in Bouro, one of the Moluccas, and among a wandering tribe of the
  Telugu-speaking districts of Southern India. According to Diodorus
  it prevailed in ancient Corsica, according to Strabo among the
  Iberians of Northern Spain (where we have seen it has lingered to
  recent times), according to Apollonius Rhodius among the Tibareni
  of Pontus. Modified traces of a like practice, not carried to the
  same extent of oddity, are also found in a variety of countries
  besides those that have been named, as in Borneo, in Kamtchatka,
  and in Greenland. In nearly all cases some particular diet, or
  abstinence from certain kinds of food and drink, and from exertion,
  is prescribed to the father; in some, more positive and trying
  penances are inflicted.

  Butler had no doubt our Traveller’s story in his head when he made
  the widow in _Hudibras_ allude in a ribald speech to the supposed
  fact that

          ————“Chineses go to bed
      And lie in, in their ladies’ stead.”

  The custom is humorously introduced, as Pauthier has noticed, in
  the Mediæval Fabliau of _Aucassin and Nicolete_. Aucassin arriving
  at the castle of Torelore asks for the king and is told he is in
  child-bed. Where then is his wife? She is gone to the wars and has
  taken all the people with her. Aucassin, greatly astonished, enters
  the palace, and wanders through it till he comes to the chamber
  where the king lay:—

      “En le canbre entre Aucassins
       Li cortois et li gentis;
       Il est venus dusqu’au lit
       Alec ú li Rois se gist.
       Pardevant lui s’arestit
       Si parla, Oès que dist;
       Diva fau, que fais-tu ci?
       Dist le Rois, Je gis d’un fil,
       Quant mes mois sera complis,
       Et ge serai bien garis,
       Dont irai le messe oïr
       Si comme mes ancessor fist,” etc.

  Aucassin pulls all the clothes off him, and cudgels him soundly,
  making him promise that never a man shall lie in again in his
  country.

  This strange custom, if it were unique, would look like a coarse
  practical joke, but appearing as it does among so many different
  races and in every quarter of the world, it must have its root
  somewhere deep in the psychology of the uncivilised man. I must
  refer to Mr. Tylor’s interesting remarks on the rationale of the
  custom, for they do not bear abridgment. Professor Max Müller
  humorously suggests that “the treatment which a husband receives
  among ourselves at the time of his wife’s confinement, not only
  from mothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, and other female relations,
  but from nurses, and from every consequential maid-servant in the
  house,” is but a “survival,” as Mr. Tylor would call it, of the
  _couvade_; or at least represents the same feeling which among
  those many uncivilised nations thus drove the husband to his
  bed, and sometimes (as among the Caribs) put him when there to
  systematic torture.

  [This custom seems to be considered generally as a survival of
  the matriarchate in a society with a patriarchal régime. We may
  add to the list of authorities on this subject: _E. Westermarck,
  Hist. of Human Marriage_, 106, _seqq._; _G. A. Wilken, De Couvade
  bij de Volken v.d. Indischen Archipel, Bijdr. Ind. Inst._, 5th
  ser., iv. p. 250. Dr. Ernest Martin, late physician of the French
  Legation at Peking, in an article on _La Couvade en Chine_ (_Revue
  Scientifique_, 24th March, 1894), gave a drawing representing the
  couvade from a sketch by a native artist.

  In the _China Review_ (XI. pp. 401–402), “Lao Kwang-tung” notes
  these interesting facts: “The Chinese believe that certain
  actions performed by the husband during the pregnancy of his wife
  will affect the child. If a dish of food on the table is raised
  by putting another dish, or anything else below it, it is not
  considered proper for a husband, who is expecting the birth of a
  child, to partake of it, for fear the two dishes should cause the
  child to have two tongues. It is extraordinary that the caution
  thus exercised by the Chinese has not prevented many of them from
  being double-tongued. This result, it is supposed, however, will
  only happen if the food so raised is eaten in the house in which
  the future mother happens to be. It is thought that the pasting
  up of the red papers containing antithetical and felicitous
  sentences on them, as at New Year’s time, by a man under similar
  circumstances, and this whether the future mother sees the action
  performed or not, will cause the child to have red marks on the
  face or any part of the body. The causes producing _naevi materni_
  have probably been the origin of such marks, rather than the idea
  entertained by the Chinese that the father, having performed an
  action by some occult mode, influences the child yet unborn. A
  case is said to have occurred in which ill effects were obviated,
  or rather obliterated, by the red papers being torn down, after
  the birth of the infant, and soaked in water, when as the red
  disappeared from the paper, so the child’s face assumed a natural
  hue. Lord Avebury also speaks of _la couvade_ as existing among the
  Chinese of West Yun-Nan. (_Origin of Civilisation and Primitive
  Condition of Man_, p. 18).”

  Dr. J. A. H. Murray, editor of the _New English Dictionary_,
  wrote, in _The Academy_, of 29th October, 1892, a letter with the
  heading of _Couvade, The Genesis of an Anthropological Term_, which
  elicited an answer from Dr. E. B. Tylor (_Academy_, 5th November):
  “Wanting a general term for such customs,” writes Dr. Tylor, “and
  finding statements in books that this male lying-in lasted on
  till modern times, in the south of France, and was there called
  _couvade_, that is brooding or hatching (_couver_), I adopted this
  word for the set of customs, and it has since become established in
  English.” The discussion was carried on in _The Academy_, 12th and
  19th November, 10th and 17th December; Mr. A. L. Mayhew wrote (12th
  November): “There is no doubt whatever that Dr. Tylor and Professor
  Max Müller (in a review of Dr. Tylor’s book) share the glory of
  having given a new technical sense to an old provincial French
  word, and of seeing it accepted in France, and safely enshrined in
  the great Dictionary of Littré.”

  Now as to the origin of the word; we have seen above that
  Rochefort was the first to use the expression _faire la couvade_.
  This author, or at least the author (see _Barbier, Ouvrages
  anonymes_) of the _Histoire naturelle ... des Iles Antilles_, which
  was published for the first time at Rotterdam, in 1658, 4to.,
  writes: “C’est qu’au méme tems que la femme est delivrée le mary
  se met au lit, pour s’y plaindre et y faire l’acouchée: coutume,
  qui bien que Sauvage et ridicule, se trouve neantmoins à ce que
  l’on dit, parmy les paysans d’vne certaine Province de France. Et
  ils appellent cela _faire la couvade_. Mais ce qui est de fâcheus
  pour le pauvre Caraïbe, qui s’est mis au lit au lieu de l’acouchée,
  c’est qu’on luy fait faire diéte dix ou douze jours de suite, ne
  luy donnant rien par jour qu’vn petit morceau de Cassave, et vn peu
  d’eau dans la quelle on a aussi fait boüillir un peu de ce pain de
  racine.... Mais ils ne font ce grand jeusne qu’à la naissance de
  leur premier enfant....” (II. pp. 607–608).

  Lafitau (_Mœurs des Sauvages Ameriquains_, I. pp. 49–50) says on
  the authority of Rochefort: “Je la trouve chez les Ibériens ou les
  premiers Peuples d’Espagne ... elle est aujourd’hui dans quelques
  unes de nos Provinces d’Espagne.”

  The word _couvade_, forgotten in the sense of lying-in-bed,
  recalled by Sacombe, has been renovated in a happy manner by Dr.
  Tylor.

  As to the custom itself, there can be no doubt of its existence,
  in spite of some denials. Dr. Tylor, in the third edition of his
  valuable _Early History of Mankind_, published in 1878 (Murray),
  since the last edition of _The Book of Ser Marco Polo_, has added
  (pp. 291 _seqq._) many more proofs to support what he had already
  said on the subject.

  There may be some strong doubts as to the _couvade_ in the south
  of France, and the authors who speak of it in Béarn and the Basque
  Countries seem to have copied one another, but there is not the
  slightest doubt of its having been and of its being actually
  practised in South America. There is a very curious account of it
  in the _Voyage dans le Nord du Brésil_ made by Father Yves d’Evreux
  in 1613 and 1614 (see pp. 88–89 of the reprint, Paris, 1864, and
  the note of the learned Ferdinand Denis, pp. 411–412). Compare with
  _Durch Central-Brasilien ... im Jahre_ 1884 _von K.v. den Steinen_.
  But the following extract from _Among the Indians of Guiana_....
  _By Everard im Thurn_ (1883), will settle, I think, the question:

  “Turning from the story of the day to the story of the life, we may
  begin at the beginning, that is, at the birth of the children. And
  here, at once, we meet with, perhaps, the most curious point in
  the habits of the Indians; the _couvade_ or male child-bed. This
  custom, which is common to the uncivilized people of many parts of
  the world, is probably among the strangest ever invented by the
  human brain. Even before the child is born, the father abstains
  for a time from certain kinds of animal food. The woman works as
  usual up to a few hours before the birth of the child. At last she
  retires alone, or accompanied only by some other women, to the
  forest, where she ties up her hammock; and then the child is born.
  Then in a few hours—often less than a day—the woman, who, like all
  women living in a very unartificial condition, suffers but little,
  gets up and resumes her ordinary work. According to Schomburgk, the
  mother, at any rate among the Macusis, remains in her hammock for
  some time, and the father hangs his hammock, and lies in it, by her
  side; but in all cases where the matter came under my notice, the
  mother left her hammock almost at once. In any case, no sooner is
  the child born than the father takes to his hammock and, abstaining
  from every sort of work, from meat and all other food, except
  weak gruel of cassava meal, from smoking, from washing himself,
  and, above all, from touching weapons of any sort, is nursed and
  cared for by all the women of the place. One other regulation,
  mentioned by Schomburgk, is certainly quaint; the interesting
  father may not scratch himself with his finger-nails, but he may
  use for this purpose a splinter, specially provided, from the
  mid-rib of a cokerite palm. This continues for many days, and
  sometimes even weeks. _Couvade_ is such a wide-spread institution,
  that I had often read and wondered at it; but it was not until I
  saw it practised around me, and found that I was often suddenly
  deprived of the services of my best hunters or boat-hands, by
  the necessity which they felt, and which nothing could persuade
  them to disregard, of observing _couvade_, that I realized its
  full strangeness. No satisfactory explanation of its origin seems
  attainable. It appears based on a belief in the existence of a
  mysterious connection between the child and its father—far closer
  than that which exists between the child and its mother,—and
  of such a nature that if the father infringes any of the rules
  of the _couvade_, for a time after the birth of the child, the
  latter suffers. For instance, if he eats the flesh of a water-haas
  (_Capybara_), a large rodent with very protruding teeth, the teeth
  of the child will grow as those of the animal; or if he eats the
  flesh of the spotted-skinned labba, the child’s skin will become
  spotted. Apparently there is also some idea that for the father to
  eat strong food, to wash, to smoke, or to handle weapons, would
  have the same result as if the new-born babe ate such food, washed,
  smoked, or played with edged tools” (pp. 217–219.)

  I have to thank Dr. Edward B. Tylor for the valuable notes he
  kindly sent me.—H. C.]

  NOTE 5.—“The abundance of gold in Yun-nan is proverbial in China,
  so that if a man lives very extravagantly they ask if his father is
  governor of Yun-nan.” (_Martini_, p. 140.)

  Polo has told us that in Eastern Yun-nan the exchange was 8 of
  silver for one of gold (ch. xlviii.); in the Western division of
  the province 6 of silver for one of gold (ch. xlix.); and now,
  still nearer the borders of Ava, only 5 of silver for one of gold.
  Such discrepancies within 15 days’ journey would be inconceivable,
  but that in both the latter instances at least he appears to
  speak of the rates at which the gold was purchased from secluded,
  ignorant, and uncivilised tribes. It is difficult to reconcile with
  other facts the reason which he assigns for the high value put
  on silver at Vochan, viz., that there was no silver-mine within
  five months’ journey. In later days, at least, Martini speaks
  of many silver-mines in Yun-nan, and the “Great Silver Mine”
  (_Bau-dwen gyi_ of the Burmese) or group of mines, which affords
  a chief supply to Burma in modern times, is not far from the
  territory of our Traveller’s Zardandan. Garnier’s map shows several
  argentiferous sites in the Valley of the Lan-t’sang.

  In another work[3] I have remarked at some length on the relative
  values of gold and silver about this time. In Western Europe
  these seem to have been as 12 to 1, and I have shown grounds for
  believing that in India, and generally over civilised Asia, the
  ratio was 10 to 1. In Pauthier’s extracts from the _Yuen-shi_ or
  Annals of the Mongol Dynasty, there is an incidental but precise
  confirmation of this, of which I was not then aware. This states
  (p. 321) that on the issue of the paper currency of 1287 the
  official instructions to the local treasuries were to issue notes
  of the nominal value of two strings, _i.e._ 2000 _wen_ or cash, for
  every ounce of flowered silver, and 20,000 cash for every ounce of
  gold. Ten to 1 must have continued to be the relation in China down
  to about the end of the 17th century if we may believe Lecomte; but
  when Milburne states the same value in the beginning of the 19th he
  must have fallen into some great error. In 1781 Sonnerat tells us
  that _formerly_ gold had been exported from China with a profit of
  25 per cent., but at that time a profit of 18 to 20 per cent. was
  made by _importing_ it. At present[4] the relative values are about
  the same as in Europe, viz. 1 to 15½ or 1 to 16; but in Canton,
  in 1844, they were 1 to 17; and Timkowski states that at Peking
  in 1821 the finest gold was valued at 18 to 1. And as regards the
  precise territory of which this chapter speaks I find in Lieutenant
  Bower’s Commercial Report on Sladen’s Mission that the price of
  pure gold at Momein in 1868 was 13 times its weight in silver (p.
  122); whilst M. Garnier mentions that the exchange at Ta-li in 1869
  was 12 to 1 (I. 522).

  Does not Shakspeare indicate at least a memory of 10 to 1 as the
  traditional relation of gold to silver when he makes the Prince of
  Morocco, balancing over Portia’s caskets, argue:—

      “Or shall I think in silver she’s immured,
       Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
       O sinful thought!”

  In Japan, at the time trade was opened, we know from Sir R.
  Alcock’s work the extraordinary fact that the proportionate value
  set upon gold and silver currency by authority was as 3 to 1.

  of “Western Miautsze,” who “in the middle of autumn sacrifice to
  the Great Ancestor or Founder of their Race.” (_The Chinese as they

  character of the summer climate at Momein, though standing between
  5000 and 6000 feet above the sea (p. 41).

  NOTE 8.—“Whereas before,” says Jack Cade to Lord Say, “our
  forefathers had no books but score and tally, thou hast caused
  printing to be used.” The use of such tallies for the record of
  contracts among the aboriginal tribes of Kweichau is mentioned by
  Chinese authorities, and the French missionaries of Bonga speak of
  the same as in use among the simple tribes in that vicinity. But,
  as Marsden notes, the use of such rude records was to be found in
  his day in higher places and much nearer home. They continued to be
  employed as records of receipts in the British Exchequer till 1834,
  “and it is worthy of recollection that the fire by which the Houses
  of Parliament were destroyed was supposed to have originated in the
  over-heating of the flues in which the discarded tallies were being
  burnt.” I remember often, when a child, to have seen the tallies of
  the colliers in Scotland, and possibly among that class they may
  survive. They appear to be still used by bakers in various parts
  of England and France, in the Canterbury hop-gardens, and locally
  in some other trades. (_Martini_, 135; _Bridgman_, 259, 262; _Eng.
  Cyclop._ sub v. _Tally_; _Notes and Queries_, 1st ser. X. 485.)

  [According to Father Crabouillet (_Missions Cath._ 1873, p. 105),
  the Lolos use tallies for their contracts; Dr. Harmand mentions
  (_Tour du Monde_, 1877, No. VII.) the same fact among the Khas of
  Central Laos; and M. Pierre Lefèvre-Pontalis (_Populations du nord
  de l’Indo-Chine_, 1892, p. 22, from the _J. As._) says he saw these
  tallies among the Khas of Luang-Prabang.—H. C.]

  “In Illustration of this custom I have to relate what follows. In
  the year 1863 the Tsaubwa (or Prince) of a Shan Province adjoining
  Yun-nan was in rebellion against the Burmese Government. He wished
  to enter into communication with the British Government. He sent
  a messenger to a British Officer with a letter tendering his
  allegiance, and accompanying this letter was a piece of bamboo
  about five inches long. This had been split down the middle, so
  that the two pieces fitted closely together, forming a tube in
  the original shape of the bamboo. A notch at one end included
  the edges of both pieces, showing that they were a pair. The
  messenger said that if the reply were favourable one of the pieces
  was to be returned and the other kept. I need hardly say the
  messenger received no written reply, and both pieces of bamboo were
  retained.” (_MS. Note by Sir Arthur Phayre._)

  NOTE 9.—Compare Mr. Hodgson’s account of the sub-Himalayan Bodos
  and Dhimals: “All diseases are ascribed to supernatural agency.
  The sick man is supposed to be possessed by one of the deities,
  who racks him with pain as a punishment for impiety or neglect of
  the god in question. Hence not the mediciner, but the exorcist, is
  summoned to the sick man’s aid.” (_J. A. S. B._ XVIII. 728.)

  NOTE 10.—Mr. Hodgson again: “Libations of fermented liquor always
  accompany sacrifice—_because_, to confess the whole truth,
  sacrifice and feast are commutable words, and feasts need to be
  crowned with copious potations.” (_Ibid._)

  NOTE 11.—And again: “The god in question is asked what sacrifice
  he requires? a buffalo, a hog, a fowl, or a duck, to spare the
  sufferer; ... anxious as I am fully to illustrate the topic, I will
  not try the patience of my readers by describing all that vast
  variety of black victims and white, of red victims and blue, which
  each particular deity is alleged to prefer.” (_Ibid._ and p. 732.)

  NOTE 12.—The same system of devil-dancing is prevalent among the
  tribes on the Lu-kiang, as described by the R. C. Missionaries. The
  conjurors are there called _Mumos_. (_Ann. de la Prop. de la Foi_,
  XXXVI. 323, and XXXVII. 312–313.)

  “Marco’s account of the exorcism of evil spirits in cases of
  obstinate illness exactly resembles what is done in similar cases
  by the Burmese, except that I never saw animals sacrificed on such
  occasions.” (_Sir A. Phayre._)

  Mouhot says of the wild people of Cambodia called _Stiens_: “When
  any one is ill they say that the Evil Spirit torments him; and to
  deliver him they set up about the patient a dreadful din which does
  not cease night or day, until some one among the bystanders falls
  down as if in a syncope, crying out, ‘I have him,—he is in me,—he
  is strangling me!’ Then they question the person who has thus
  become possessed. They ask him what remedies will save the patient;
  what remedies does the Evil Spirit require that he may give up his
  prey? Sometimes it is an ox or a pig; but too often it is a human
  victim.” (_J. R. G. S._ XXXII. 147.)

  See also the account of the Samoyede _Tadibeï_ or Devil-dancer in
  Klaproth’s _Magasin Asiatique_ (II. 83).

  In fact these strange rites of Shamanism, devil-dancing, or what
  not, are found with wonderful identity of character among the
  non-Caucasian races over parts of the earth most remote from one
  another, not only among the vast variety of Indo-Chinese Tribes,
  but among the Tamulian tribes of India, the Veddahs of Ceylon,
  the races of Siberia, and the red nations of North and South
  America. Hinduism has assimilated these “prior superstitions of the
  sons of Tur” as Mr. Hodgson calls them, in the form of Tantrika
  mysteries, whilst, in the wild performance of the Dancing Dervishes
  at Constantinople, we see perhaps again the infection of Turanian
  blood breaking out from the very heart of Mussulman orthodoxy.

  Dr. Caldwell has given a striking account of the practice of
  devil-dancing among the Shanars of Tinnevelly, which forms a
  perfect parallel in modern language to our Traveller’s description
  of a scene of which he also had manifestly been an eye-witness:
  “When the preparations are completed and the devil-dance is about
  to commence, the music is at first comparatively slow; the dancer
  seems impassive and sullen, and he either stands still or moves
  about in gloomy silence. Gradually, as the music becomes quicker
  and louder, his excitement begins to rise. Sometimes, to help him
  to work himself up into a frenzy, he uses medicated draughts, cuts
  and lacerates himself till the blood flows, lashes himself with
  a huge whip, presses a burning torch to his breast, drinks the
  blood which flows from his own wounds, or drains the blood of the
  sacrifice, putting the throat of the decapitated goat to his mouth.
  Then, as if he had acquired new life, he begins to brandish his
  staff of bells, and to dance with a quick but wild unsteady step.
  Suddenly the afflatus descends; there is no mistaking that glare,
  or those frantic leaps. He snorts, he stares, he gyrates. The demon
  has now taken bodily possession of him, and though he retains the
  power of utterance and motion, both are under the demon’s control,
  and his separate consciousness is in abeyance. The bystanders
  signalise the event by raising a long shout, attended with a
  peculiar vibratory noise, caused by the motion of the hand and
  tongue, or the tongue alone. The devil-dancer is now worshipped
  as a present deity, and every bystander consults him respecting
  his diseases, his wants, the welfare of his absent relatives, the
  offerings to be made for the accomplishment of his wishes, and in
  short everything for which superhuman knowledge is supposed to be
  available.” (_Hodgson, J. R. As. Soc._ XVIII. 397; _The Tinnevelly
  Shanars_, by the _Rev. R. Caldwell, B.A._, Madras, 1849, pp. 19–20.)

                              CHAPTER LI.

       WHEREIN IS RELATED HOW THE KING OF MIEN AND BANGALA VOWED
                   VENGEANCE AGAINST THE GREAT KAAN.


But I was forgetting to tell you of a famous battle that was fought in
the kingdom of Vochan in the Province of Zardandan, and that ought not
to be omitted from our Book. So we will relate all the particulars.

You see, in the year of Christ, 1272,{1} the Great Kaan sent a large
force into the kingdoms of Carajan and Vochan, to protect them from
the ravages of ill-disposed people; and this was before he had sent
any of his sons to rule the country, as he did afterwards when he made
Sentemur king there, the son of a son of his who was deceased.

Now there was a certain king, called the king of MIEN and of BANGALA,
who was a very puissant prince, with much territory and treasure and
people; and he was not as yet subject to the Great Kaan, though it was
not long after that the latter conquered him and took from him both
the kingdoms that I have named.{2} And it came to pass that when this
king of Mien and Bangala heard that the host of the Great Kaan was at
Vochan, he said to himself that it behoved him to go against them with
so great a force as should insure his cutting off the whole of them,
insomuch that the Great Kaan would be very sorry ever to send an army
again thither [to his frontier].

So this king prepared a great force and munitions of war; and he had,
let me tell you, 2000 great elephants, on each of which was set a tower
of timber, well framed and strong, and carrying from twelve to sixteen
well-armed fighting men.{3} And besides these, he had of horsemen and
of footmen good 60,000 men. In short, he equipped a fine force, as well
befitted such a puissant prince. It was indeed a host capable of doing
great things.

And what shall I tell you? When the king had completed these great
preparations to fight the Tartars, he tarried not, but straightway
marched against them. And after advancing without meeting with anything
worth mentioning, they arrived within three days of the Great Kaan’s
host, which was then at Vochan in the territory of Zardandan, of which
I have already spoken. So there the king pitched his camp, and halted
to refresh his army.


  NOTE 1.—This date is no doubt corrupt. (See note 3, ch. lii.)

  NOTE 2.—MIEN is the name by which the kingdom of Burma or Ava was
  and is known to the Chinese. M. Garnier informs me that _Mien-Kwé_
  or _Mien-tisong_ is the name always given in Yun-nan to that
  kingdom, whilst the Shans at Kiang Hung call the Burmese _Man_
  (pronounced like the English word).

  The title given to the sovereign in question of King of BENGAL, as
  well as of Mien, is very remarkable. We shall see reason hereafter
  to conceive that Polo did more or less confound Bengal with _Pegu_,
  which was subject to the Burmese monarchy up to the time of the
  Mongol invasion. But apart from any such misapprehension, there
  is not only evidence of rather close relations between Burma and
  Gangetic India in the ages immediately preceding that of our
  author, but also some ground for believing that he may be right in
  his representation, and that the King of Burma may have at this
  time arrogated the title of “King of Bengal,” which is attributed
  to him in the text.

  Anaurahta, one of the most powerful kings in Burmese history
  (1017–1059), extended his conquests to the frontiers of India,
  and is stated to have set up images within that country. He also
  married an Indian princess, the daughter of the King of _Wethali_
  (_i.e._ _Vaiçali_ in Tirhút).

  There is also in the _Burmese Chronicle_ a somewhat confused story
  regarding a succeeding king, Kyan-tsittha (A.D. 1064), who desired
  to marry his daughter to the son of the King of _Patteik-Kará_, a
  part of Bengal.[1] The marriage was objected to by the Burmese
  nobles, but the princess was already with child by the Bengal
  prince; and their son eventually succeeded to the Burmese throne
  under the name of Alaungtsi-thu. When king, he travelled all over
  his dominions, and visited the images which Anaurahta had set up in
  India. He also maintained intercourse with the King of Patteik-Kará
  and married his daughter. Alaungtsi-thu is stated to have lived to
  the age of 101 years, and to have reigned 75. Even then his death
  was hastened by his son Narathu, who smothered him in the temple
  called Shwé-Ku (“Golden Cave”), at Pagán, and also put to death
  his Bengali step-mother. The father of the latter sent eight brave
  men, disguised as Brahmans, to avenge his daughter’s death. Having
  got access to the royal presence through their sacred character,
  they slew King Narathu and then themselves. Hence King Narathu is
  known in the Burmese history as the _Kalá-Ḳya Meng_, or “King slain
  by the Hindus.” He was building the great Temple at Pagán called
  _Dhammayangyi_, at the time of his death, which occurred about
  the year 1171. The great-grandson of this king was Narathihapade
  (presumably _Narasinha-pati_), the king reigning at the time of the
  Mongol invasion.

  All these circumstances show tolerably close relations between
  Burma and Bengal, and also _that the dynasty then reigning in
  Burma was descended from a Bengal stock_. Sir Arthur Phayre, after
  noting these points, remarks: “From all these circumstances, and
  from the conquests attributed to Anaurahta, it is very probable
  that, after the conquest of Bengal by the Mahomedans in the 13th
  century, the kings of Burma would assume the title of _Kings of
  Bengal_. This is nowhere expressly stated in the Burmese history,
  but the course of events renders it very probable. We know that the
  claim to Bengal was asserted by the kings of Burma in long after
  years. In the Journal of the Marquis of Hastings, under the date of
  6th September, 1818, is the following passage: ‘The king of Burma
  favoured us early this year with the obliging requisition that we
  should cede to him Moorshedabad and the provinces to the east of
  it, which he deigned to say were all natural dependencies of his
  throne.’ And at the time of the disputes on the frontier of Arakan,
  in 1823–1824, which led to the war of the two following years,
  the Governor of Arakan made a similar demand. We may therefore
  reasonably conclude that at the close of the 13th century of the
  Christian era the kings of Pagán called themselves kings of Burma
  and of Bengala.” (_MS. Note by Sir Arthur Phayre_; see also his
  paper in _J. A. S. B._ vol. XXXVII. part I.)

  NOTE 3.—It is very difficult to know what to make of the repeated
  assertions of old writers as to the numbers of men carried by
  war-elephants, or, if we could admit those numbers, to conceive how
  the animal could have carried the enormous structure necessary to
  give them space to use their weapons. The Third Book of Maccabees
  is the most astounding in this way, alleging that a single elephant
  carried 32 stout men, besides the Indian _Mahaut_. Bochart indeed
  supposes the number here to be a clerical error for 12, but this
  would even be extravagant. Friar Jordanus is, no doubt, building
  on the Maccabees rather than on his own Oriental experience when
  he says that the elephant “carrieth easily more than 30 men.”
  Philostratus, in his _Life of Apollonius_, speaks of 10 to 15;
  Ibn Batuta of about 20; and a great elephant sent by Timur to the
  Sultan of Egypt is said to have carried 20 drummers. Christopher
  Borri says that in Cochin China the elephant did ordinarily carry
  13 or 14 persons, 6 on each side in two tiers of 3 each, and 2
  behind. On the other hand, among the ancients, Strabo and Aelian
  speak of _three_ soldiers only in addition to the driver, and
  Livy, describing the Battle of Magnesia, of _four_. These last are
  reasonable statements.

[1] Sir A. Phayre thinks this may have been _Vikrampúr_, for some
    time the capital of Eastern Bengal before the Mahomedan conquest.
    Vikrampúr was some miles east of Dacca, and the dynasty in question
    was that called _Vaidya_. (See _Lassen_, III. 749.) _Patteik-Kará_
    is apparently an attempt to represent some Hindi name such as
    _Patthargarh_, “The Stone-Fort.”




                             CHAPTER LII.

    OF THE BATTLE THAT WAS FOUGHT BY THE GREAT KAAN’S HOST AND HIS
                 SENESCHAL, AGAINST THE KING OF MIEN.


And when the Captain of the Tartar host had certain news that the
king aforesaid was coming against him with so great a force, he waxed
uneasy, seeing that he had with him but 12,000 horsemen. Natheless he
was a most valiant and able soldier, of great experience in arms and
an excellent Captain; and his name was NESCRADIN.{1} His troops too
were very good, and he gave them very particular orders and cautions
how to act, and took every measure for his own defence and that of
his army. And why should I make a long story of it? The whole force
of the Tartars, consisting of 12,000 well-mounted horsemen, advanced
to receive the enemy in the Plain of Vochan, and there they waited to
give them battle. And this they did through the good judgment of the
excellent Captain who led them; for hard by that plain was a great
wood, thick with trees. And so there in the plain the Tartars awaited
their foe. Let us then leave discoursing of them a while; we shall come
back to them presently; but meantime let us speak of the enemy.

After the King of Mien had halted long enough to refresh his troops, he
resumed his march, and came to the Plain of Vochan, where the Tartars
were already in order of battle. And when the king’s army had arrived
in the plain, and was within a mile of the enemy, he caused all the
castles that were on the elephants to be ordered for battle, and the
fighting-men to take up their posts on them, and he arrayed his horse
and his foot with all skill, like a wise king as he was. And when he
had completed all his arrangements he began to advance to engage the
enemy. The Tartars, seeing the foe advance, showed no dismay, but came
on likewise with good order and discipline to meet them. And when they
were near and nought remained but to begin the fight, the horses of the
Tartars took such fright at the sight of the elephants that they could
not be got to face the foe, but always swerved and turned back; whilst
all the time the king and his forces, and all his elephants, continued
to advance upon them.{2}

And when the Tartars perceived how the case stood, they were in great
wrath, and wist not what to say or do; for well enough they saw that
unless they could get their horses to advance, all would be lost. But
their Captain acted like a wise leader who had considered everything
beforehand. He immediately gave orders that every man should dismount
and tie his horse to the trees of the forest that stood hard by, and
that then they should take to their bows, a weapon that they know how
to handle better than any troops in the world. They did as he bade
them, and plied their bows stoutly, shooting so many shafts at the
advancing elephants that in a short space they had wounded or slain the
greater part of them as well as of the men they carried. The enemy also
shot at the Tartars, but the Tartars had the better weapons, and were
the better archers to boot.

And what shall I tell you? Understand that when the elephants felt the
smart of those arrows that pelted them like rain, they turned tail and
fled, and nothing on earth would have induced them to turn and face the
Tartars. So off they sped with such a noise and uproar that you would
have trowed the world was coming to an end! And then too they plunged
into the wood and rushed this way and that, dashing their castles
against the trees, bursting their harness and smashing and destroying
everything that was on them.

So when the Tartars saw that the elephants had turned tail and could
not be brought to face the fight again, they got to horse at once
and charged the enemy. And then the battle began to rage furiously
with sword and mace. Right fiercely did the two hosts rush together,
and deadly were the blows exchanged. The king’s troops were far more
in number than the Tartars, but they were not of such metal, nor so
inured to war; otherwise the Tartars who were so few in number could
never have stood against them. Then might you see swashing blows dealt
and taken from sword and mace; then might you see knights and horses
and men-at-arms go down; then might you see arms and hands and legs
and heads hewn off: and besides the dead that fell, many a wounded
man, that never rose again, for the sore press there was. The din and
uproar were so great from this side and from that, that God might have
thundered and no man would have heard it! Great was the medley, and
dire and parlous was the fight that was fought on both sides; but the
Tartars had the best of it.{3}

In an ill hour indeed, for the king and his people, was that battle
begun, so many of them were slain therein. And when they had continued
fighting till midday the king’s troops could stand against the Tartars
no longer; but felt that they were defeated, and turned and fled. And
when the Tartars saw them routed they gave chase, and hacked and slew
so mercilessly that it was a piteous sight to see. But after pursuing
a while they gave up, and returned to the wood to catch the elephants
that had run away, and to manage this they had to cut down great trees
to bar their passage. Even then they would not have been able to take
them without the help of the king’s own men who had been taken, and
who knew better how to deal with the beasts than the Tartars did. The
elephant is an animal that hath more wit than any other; but in this
way at last they were caught, more than 200 of them. And it was from
this time forth that the Great Kaan began to keep numbers of elephants.

So thus it was that the king aforesaid was defeated by the sagacity and
superior skill of the Tartars as you have heard.


  NOTE 1.—_Nescradin_ for Nesradin, as we had _Bascra_ for Basra.

  This NÁSRUDDIN was apparently an officer of whom Rashiduddin
  speaks, and whom he calls governor (or perhaps commander) in
  Karájáng. He describes him as having succeeded in that command to
  his father the Sayad Ajil of Bokhara, one of the best of Kúblái’s
  chief Ministers. Nasr-uddin retained his position in Yun-nan till
  his death, which Rashid, writing about 1300, says occurred five or
  six years before. His son Bayan, who also bore the grandfather’s
  title of Sayad Ajil, was Minister of Finance under Kúblái’s
  successor; and another son, Ḥálá, is also mentioned as one of the
  governors of the province of Fu-chau. (See _Cathay_, pp. 265, 268,
  and _D’Ohsson_, II. 507–508.)

  Nasr-uddin (_Nasulating_) is also frequently mentioned as employed
  on this frontier by the Chinese authorities whom Pauthier cites.

  [Na-su-la-ding [Nasr-uddin] was the eldest of the five sons of
  the Mohammedan Sai-dien-ch’i shan-sze-ding, Sayad Ajil, a native
  of Bokhara, who died in Yun-nan, where he had been governor when
  Kúblái, in the reign of Mangu, entered the country. Nasr-uddin “has
  a separate biography in ch. cxxv of the _Yuen-shi_. He was governor
  of the province of Yun-nan, and distinguished himself in the war
  against the southern tribes of _Kiao-chi_ (Cochin-China) and _Mien_
  (Burma). He died in 1292, the father of twelve sons, the names of
  five of which are given in the biography, viz. _Bo-yen-ch’a-rh_
  [Bayan], who held a high office, Omar, Djafar, Hussein, and Saadi.”
  (_Bretschneider, Med. Res._ I. 270–271). Mr. E. H. Parker writes
  in the _China Review_, February–March, 1901, pp. 196–197, that the
  Mongol history states that amongst the reforms of Nasr-uddin’s
  father in Yun-nan, was the introduction of coffins for the dead,
  instead of burning them.—H. C.]

  [NOTE 2.—In his battle near Sardis, Cyrus “collected together all
  the camels that had come in the train of his army to carry the
  provisions and the baggage, and taking off their loads, he mounted
  riders upon them accoutred as horsemen. These he commanded to
  advance in front of his other troops against the Lydian horse....
  The reason why Cyrus opposed his camels to the enemy’s horse was,
  because the horse has a natural dread of the camel, and cannot
  abide either the sight or the smell of that animal.... The two
  armies then joined battle, and immediately the Lydian war-horses,
  seeing and smelling the camels, turned round and galloped off.”
  (_Herodotus_, Bk. I. i. p. 220, _Rawlinson’s_ ed.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—We are indebted to Pauthier for very interesting
  illustrations of this narrative from the Chinese Annalists (p.
  410 _seqq._). These latter fix the date to the year 1277, and it
  is probable that the 1272 or MCCLXXII of the Texts was a clerical
  error for MCCLXXVII. The Annalists describe the people of Mien as
  irritated at calls upon them to submit to the Mongols (whose power
  they probably did not appreciate, as their descendants did not
  appreciate the British power in 1824), and as crossing the frontier
  of Yung-ch’ang to establish fortified posts. The force of Mien,
  they say, amounted to 50,000 men, with 800 elephants and 10,000
  horses, whilst the Mongol Chief had but _seven hundred_ men. “When
  the elephants felt the arrows (of the Mongols) they turned tail and
  fled with the platforms on their backs into a place that was set
  thickly with sharp bamboo-stakes, and these their riders laid hold
  of to prick them with.” This threw the Burmese army into confusion;
  they fled, and were pursued with great slaughter.

  The Chinese author does not mention Nasr-uddin in connection with
  this battle. He names as the chief of the Mongol force _Huthukh_
  (Kutuka?), commandant of Ta-li fu. Nasr-uddin is mentioned as
  advancing, a few months later (about December, 1277), with nearly
  4000 men to Kiangtheu (which appears to have been on the Irawadi,
  somewhere near Bhamó, and is perhaps the Kaungtaung of the
  Burmese), but effecting little (p. 415).

  [I have published in the _Rev. Ext. Orient_, II. 72–88, from the
  British Museum _Add. MS._ 16913, the translation by Mgr. Visdelou,
  of Chinese documents relating to the Kingdom of Mien and the wars
  of Kúblái; the battle won by _Hu-tu_, commandant of Ta-li, was
  fought during the 3rd month of the 14th year (1277). (Cf. Pauthier,
  _supra_.)—H. C.]

  These affairs of the battle in the Yung-ch’ang territory, and the
  advance of Nasr-uddin to the Irawadi are, as Polo clearly implies
  in the beginning of ch. li., quite distinct from the invasion and
  conquest of Mien some years later, of which he speaks in ch. liv.
  They are not mentioned in the Burmese Annals at all.

  Sir Arthur Phayre is inclined to reject altogether the story of
  the battle near Yung-ch’ang in consequence of this absence from
  the _Burmese Chronicle_, and of its inconsistency with the purely
  defensive character which that record assigns to the action of
  the Burmese Government in regard to China at this time. With the
  strongest respect for my friend’s opinion I feel it impossible
  to assent to this. We have not only the concurrent testimony of
  Marco and of the Chinese Official Annals of the Mongol Dynasty to
  the facts of the Burmese provocation and of the engagement within
  the Yung-ch’ang or Vochan territory, but we have in the Chinese
  narrative a consistent chronology and tolerably full detail of the
  relations between the two countries.

  [Baber writes (p. 173): “Biot has it that Yung-ch’ang was first
  established by the Mings, long subsequent to the time of Marco’s
  visit, but the name was well known much earlier. The mention by
  Marco of the Plain of Vochan (Unciam would be a perfect reading),
  as if it were a plain _par excellence_, is strikingly consistent
  with the position of the city on the verge of the largest plain
  west of Yünnan-fu. Hereabouts was fought the great battle between
  the ‘valiant soldier and the excellent captain Nescradin,’ with his
  12,000 well-mounted Tartars, against the King of Burmah and a large
  army, whose strength lay in 2000 elephants, on each of which was
  set a tower of timber full of well-armed fighting men.

  “There is no reason to suppose this ‘dire and parlous fight’ to
  be mythical, apart from the consistency of annals adduced by
  Colonel Yule; the local details of the narrative, particularly
  the prominent importance of the wood as an element of the Tartar
  success, are convincing. It seems to have been the first occasion
  on which the Mongols engaged a large body of elephants, and this,
  no doubt, made the victory memorable.

  “Marco informs us that ‘from this time forth the Great Khan began
  to keep numbers of elephants.’ It is obvious that cavalry could not
  manœuvre in a morass such as fronts the city. Let us refer to the
  account of the battle.

  “‘The Great Khan’s host was at Yung-ch’ang, from which they
  advanced into the plain, and there waited to give battle. This they
  did through the good judgment of the captain, for hard by that
  plain was a great wood thick with trees.’ The general’s purpose
  was more probably to occupy the dry undulating slopes near the
  south end of the valley. An advance of about five miles would
  have brought him to that position. The statement that ‘the King’s
  army arrived in the plain, and was within a mile of the enemy,’
  would then accord perfectly with the conditions of the ground. The
  Burmese would have found themselves at about that distance from
  their foes as soon as they were fairly in the plain.

  “The trees ‘hard by the plain,’ to which the Tartars tied their
  horses, and in which the elephants were entangled, were in all
  probability in the corner below the ‘rolling hills’ marked in the
  chart. Very few trees remain, but in any case the grove would
  long ago have been cut down by the Chinese, as everywhere on
  inhabited plains. A short distance up the hill, however, groves
  of exceptionally fine trees are passed. The army, as it seems to
  us, must have entered the plain from its southernmost point. The
  route by which we departed on our way to Burmah would be very
  embarrassing, though perhaps not utterly impossible, for so great a
  number of elephants.”—H. C.]

  Between 1277 and the end of the century the Chinese Annals record
  three campaigns or expeditions against MIEN; viz. (1) that which
  Marco has related in this chapter; (2) that which he relates in
  ch. liv.; and (3) one undertaken in 1300 at the request of the
  son of the legitimate Burmese King, who had been put to death by
  an usurper. The Burmese Annals mention only the two latest, but,
  concerning both the date and the main circumstances of these two,
  Chinese and Burmese Annals are in almost entire agreement. Surely
  then it can scarcely be doubted that the Chinese authority is amply
  trustworthy for the _first_ campaign also, respecting which the
  Burmese book is silent; even were the former not corroborated by
  the independent authority of Marco.

  Indeed the mutual correspondence of these Annals, especially as
  to chronology, is very remarkable, and is an argument for greater
  respect to the chronological value of the Burmese Chronicle and
  other Indo-Chinese records of like character than we should
  otherwise be apt to entertain. Compare the story of the expedition
  of 1300 as told after the Chinese Annals by De Mailla, and after
  the Burmese Chronicle by Burney and Phayre. (See _De Mailla_, IX.
  476 _seqq._; and _J. A. S. B._ vol. vi. pp. 121–122, and vol.
  xxxvii. Pt. I. pp. 102 and 110.)




                             CHAPTER LIII.

     OF THE GREAT DESCENT THAT LEADS TOWARDS THE KINGDOM OF MIEN.


After leaving the Province of which I have been speaking you come to
a great Descent. In fact you ride for two days and a half continually
down hill. On all this descent there is nothing worthy of mention
except only that there is a large place there where occasionally a
great market is held; for all the people of the country round come
thither on fixed days, three times a week, and hold a market there.
They exchange gold for silver; for they have gold in abundance; and
they give one weight of fine gold for five weights of fine silver; so
this induces merchants to come from various quarters bringing silver
which they exchange for gold with these people; and in this way the
merchants make great gain. As regards those people of the country
who dispose of gold so cheaply, you must understand that nobody is
acquainted with their places of abode, for they dwell in inaccessible
positions, in sites so wild and strong that no one can get at them to
meddle with them. Nor will they allow anybody to accompany them so as
to gain a knowledge of their abodes.{1}

After you have ridden those two days and a half down hill, you find
yourself in a province towards the south which is pretty near to India,
and this province is called AMIEN. You travel therein for fifteen days
through a very unfrequented country, and through great woods abounding
in elephants and unicorns and numbers of other wild beasts. There
are no dwellings and no people, so we need say no more of this wild
country, for in sooth there is nothing to tell. But I have a story to
relate which you shall now hear{2}.


  NOTE 1.—In all the Shan towns visited by Major Sladen on this
  frontier he found markets held _every fifth day_. This custom, he
  says, is borrowed from China, and is general throughout Western
  Yun-nan. There seem to be traces of this five-day week over
  Indo-China, and it is found in Java; as it is in Mexico. The
  Kakhyens attend in great crowds. They do _not_ now bring gold for
  sale to Momein, though it is found to some extent in their hills,
  more especially in the direction of Mogaung, whence it is exported
  towards Assam.

  Major Sladen saw a small quantity of nuggets in the possession of a
  Kakhyen who had brought them from a hill two days north of Bhamó.
  (_MS. Notes by Major Sladen._)

  NOTE 2.—I confess that the indications in this and the beginning
  of the following chapter are, to me, full of difficulty. According
  to the general style of Polo’s itinerary, the 2½ days should be
  reckoned from Yung-ch’ang; the distance therefore to the capital
  city of Mien would be 17½ days. The real capital of Mien or Burma
  at this time was, however, Pagán, in lat. 21° 13′, and that city
  could hardly have been reached by a land traveller in any such
  time. We shall see that something may be said in behalf of the
  supposition that the point reached was _Tagaung_ or _Old Pagán_,
  on the upper Irawadi, in lat. 23° 28′; and there was perhaps some
  confusion in the traveller’s mind between this and the great city.
  The descent might then be from Yung-ch’ang to the valley of the
  Shwéli, and that valley then followed to the Irawadi. Taking as a
  scale Polo’s 5 marches from Tali to Yung-ch’ang, I find we should
  by this route make just about 17 marches from Yung-ch’ang to
  Tagaung. We have no detailed knowledge of the route, but there _is_
  a road that way, and by no other does the plain country approach
  so near to Yung-ch’ang. (See _Anderson’s Report on Expedition to
  Western Yunnan_, p. 160.)

  Dr. Anderson’s remarks on the present question do not in my
  opinion remove the difficulties. He supposes the long descent to
  be the descent into the plains of the Irawadi near Bhamo; and from
  that point the land journey to Great Pagán could, he conceives,
  “easily be accomplished in 15 days.” I greatly doubt the latter
  assumption. By the scale I have just referred to it would take at
  least 20 days. And to calculate the 2½ days with which the journey
  commences from an indefinite point seems scarcely admissible. Polo
  is giving us a continuous _itinerary_; it would be ruptured if he
  left an indefinite distance between his last station and his “long
  descent.” And if the same principle were applied to the 5 days
  between Carajan (or Tali) and Vochan (Yung-ch’ang), the result
  would be nonsense.

  [_Mien-tien_, to which is devoted ch. vii. of the Chinese work
  _Sze-i-kwan-k’ao_, appears to have included much more than Burma
  proper. (See the passage _supra_, pp. 70–71, quoted by Devéria from
  the _Yuen-shi lei pien_ regarding _Kien-tou_ and _Kin-Chi_.)—H. C.]

  The hypothesis that I have suggested would suit better with the
  traveller’s representation of the country traversed as wild and
  uninhabited. In a journey to Great Pagán the most populous and
  fertile part of Burma would be passed through.

  [Baber writes (p. 180): “The generally received theory that
  ‘the great descent which leads towards the Kingdom of Mien,’ on
  which ‘you ride for two days and a half continually downhill,’
  was the route from Yung-ch’ang to T’eng-Yueh, must be at once
  abandoned. Marco was, no doubt, speaking from hearsay, or rather,
  from a recollection of hearsay, as it does not appear that he
  possessed any notes; but there is good reason for supposing that
  he had personally visited Yung-ch’ang. Weary of the interminable
  mountain-paths, and encumbered with much baggage—for a magnate of
  Marco’s court influence could never, in the East, have travelled
  without a considerable state—impeded, in addition, by a certain
  quantity of merchandise, for he was ‘discreet and prudent in
  every way,’ he would have listened longingly to the report of an
  easy ride of two and a half days downhill, and would never have
  forgotten it. That such a route exists I am well satisfied. Where
  is it? The stream which drains the Yung-ch’ang plain communicates
  with the Salwen by a river called the ‘Nan-tien,’ not to be
  confounded with the ‘Nan-ting,’ about 45 miles south of that city,
  a fair journey of two and a half days. Knowing, as we now do, that
  it must descend some 3500 feet in that distance, does it not seem
  reasonable to suppose that the valley of this rivulet is the route
  alluded to? The great battle on the Yung-ch’ang plain, moreover,
  was fought only a few years before Marco’s visit, and seeing that
  the king and his host of elephants in all probability entered the
  valley from the south, travellers to Burma would naturally have
  quitted it by the same route.

  “But again, our mediæval Herodotus reports that ‘the country is
  wild and hard of access, full of great woods and mountains which
  ’tis impossible to pass, the air is so impure and unwholesome; and
  any foreigners attempting it would die for certain.’

  “This is exactly and literally the description given us of the
  district in which we crossed the Salwen.

  “To insist on the theory of the descent by this route is to make
  the traveller ride downhill, ‘over mountains it is impossible to
  pass.’

  “The fifteen days’ subsequent journey described by Marco need not
  present much difficulty. The distance from the junction of the
  Nan-tien with the Salwen to the capital of Burma (Pagán) would
  be something over 300 miles; fifteen days seems a fair estimate
  for the distance, seeing that a great part of the journey would
  doubtless be by boat.”

  Regarding this last paragraph, Captain Gill says (II. 345): “An
  objection may be raised that no such route as this is known to
  exist; but it must be remembered that the Burmese capital changes
  its position every now and then, and it is obvious that the trade
  routes would be directed to the capital, and would change with it.
  Altogether, with the knowledge at present available, this certainly
  seems the most satisfactory interpretation of the old traveller’s
  story.”—H. C.]




                             CHAPTER LIV.

   CONCERNING THE CITY OF MIEN, AND THE TWO TOWERS THAT ARE THEREIN,
                 ONE OF GOLD AND THE OTHER OF SILVER.


And when you have travelled those 15 days through such a difficult
country as I have described, in which travellers have to carry
provisions for the road because there are no inhabitants, then you
arrive at the capital city of this Province of Mien, and it also is
called AMIEN, and is a very great and noble city.{1} The people are
Idolaters and have a peculiar language, and are subject to the Great
Kaan.

And in this city there is a thing so rich and rare that I must tell you
about it. You see there was in former days a rich and puissant king in
this city, and when he was about to die he commanded that by his tomb
they should erect two towers [one at either end], one of gold and the
other of silver, in such fashion as I shall tell you. The towers are
built of fine stone; and then one of them has been covered with gold
a good finger in thickness, so that the tower looks as if it were all
of solid gold; and the other is covered with silver in like manner so
that it seems to be all of solid silver. Each tower is a good ten paces
in height and of breadth in proportion. The upper part of these towers
is round, and girt all about with bells, the top of the gold tower
with gilded bells and the silver tower with silvered bells, insomuch
that whenever the wind blows among these bells they tinkle. [The tomb
likewise was plated partly with gold, and partly with silver.] The King
caused these towers to be erected to commemorate his magnificence and
for the good of his soul; and really they do form one of the finest
sights in the world; so exquisitely finished are they, so splendid
and costly. And when they are lighted up by the sun they shine most
brilliantly and are visible from a vast distance.

Now you must know that the Great Kaan conquered the country in this
fashion.

You see at the Court of the Great Kaan there was a great number of
gleemen and jugglers; and he said to them one day that he wanted them
to go and conquer the aforesaid province of Mien, and that he would
give them a good Captain to lead them and other good aid. And they
replied that they would be delighted. So the Emperor caused them to
be fitted out with all that an army requires, and gave them a Captain
and a body of men-at-arms to help them; and so they set out, and
marched until they came to the country and province of Mien. And they
did conquer the whole of it! And when they found in the city the two
towers of gold and silver of which I have been telling you, they were
greatly astonished, and sent word thereof to the Great Kaan, asking
what he would have them do with the two towers, seeing what a great
quantity of wealth there was upon them. And the Great Kaan, being well
aware that the King had caused these towers to be made for the good
of his soul, and to preserve his memory after his death, said that he
would not have them injured, but would have them left precisely as
they were. And that was no wonder either, for you must know that no
Tartar in the world will ever, if he can help it, lay hand on anything
appertaining to the dead.{2}

[Illustration: THE CITY OF MIEN

  WITH THE GOLD AND SILVER TOWERS]

They have in this province numbers of elephants and wild oxen;{3} also
beautiful stags and deer and roe, and other kinds of large game in
plenty.

Now having told you about the province of Mien, I will tell you about
another province which is called Bangala, as you shall hear presently.


  NOTE 1.—The name of the city appears as _Amien_ both in Pauthier’s
  text here, and in the G. Text in the preceding chapter. In the Bern
  MS. it is _Aamien_. Perhaps some form like _Amien_ was that used by
  the Mongols and Persians. I fancy it may be traced in the _Arman_
  or _Uman_ of Rashiduddin, probably corrupt readings (in _Elliot_ I.
  72).

  NOTE 2.—M. Pauthier’s extracts are here again very valuable. We
  gather from them that the first Mongol communication with the
  King of Mien or Burma took place in 1271, when the Commandant
  of Tali-fu sent a deputation to that sovereign to demand an
  acknowledgment of the supremacy of the Emperor. This was followed
  by various negotiations and acts of offence on both sides, which
  led to the campaign of 1277, already spoken of. For a few years no
  further events appear to be recorded, but in 1282, in consequence
  of a report from Násruddin of the ease with which Mien could be
  conquered, an invasion was ordered under a Prince of the Blood
  called Siangtaur [called _Siam-ghu-talh_, by Visdelou.—H. C.]. This
  was probably _Singtur_, great-grandson of one of the brothers of
  Chinghiz, who a few years later took part in the insurrection of
  Nayan. (See _D’Ohsson_, II. 461.) The army started from Yun-nan fu,
  then called Chung-khing (and the _Yachi_ of Polo) in the autumn of
  1283. We are told that the army made use of boats to descend the
  River _Oho_ to the fortified city of Kiangtheu (see _supra_, note
  3, ch. lii.), which they took and sacked; and as the King still
  refused to submit, they then advanced to the “primitive capital,”
  _Taikung_, which they captured. Here Pauthier’s details stop. (Pp.
  405, 416; see also _D’Ohsson_, II. 444 [and _Visdelou_].)

  [Illustration: The Palace of the King of Mien in modern times.]

  It is curious to compare these narratives with that from the
  Burmese Royal Annals given by Colonel Burney, and again by Sir
  A. Phayre in the _J. A. S. B._ (IV. 401, and XXXVII. Pt. I. p.
  101.) Those annals afford no mention of transactions with the
  Mongols previous to 1281. In that year they relate that a mission
  of ten nobles and 1000 horse came from the Emperor to demand gold
  and silver vessels as symbols of homage on the ground of an old
  precedent. The envoys conducted themselves disrespectfully (the
  tradition was that they refused to take off their boots, an old
  grievance at the Burmese court), and the King put them all to
  death. The Emperor of course was very wroth, and sent an army of
  6,000,000 of horse and 20,000,000 of foot (!) to invade Burma.
  The Burmese generals had their _point d’appui_ at the city of
  _Nga-tshaung-gyan_, apparently somewhere near the mouth of the
  Bhamó River, and after a protracted resistance on that river, they
  were obliged to retire. They took up a new point of defence on the
  Hill of Malé, which they had fortified. Here a decisive battle was
  fought, and the Burmese were entirely routed. The King, on hearing
  of their retreat from Bhamó, at first took measures for fortifying
  his capital Pagán, and destroyed 6000 temples of various sizes to
  furnish material. But after all he lost heart, and embarking with
  his treasure and establishments on the Irawadi, fled down that
  river to Bassein in the Delta. The Chinese continued the pursuit
  long past Pagán till they reached the place now called _Tarokmau_
  or “Chinese Point,” 30 miles below Prome. Here they were forced
  by want of provisions to return. The Burmese Annals place the
  abandonment of Pagán by the King in 1284, a most satisfactory
  synchronism with the Chinese record. It is a notable point in
  Burmese history, for it marked the fall of an ancient Dynasty
  which was speedily followed by its extinction, and the abandonment
  of the capital. The King is known in the Burmese Annals as
  _Tarok-pyé-Meng_, “The King who fled from the _Tarok_.”[1]

  In Dr. Mason’s abstract of the Pegu Chronicle we find the notable
  statement with reference to this period that “the Emperor of China,
  having subjugated Pagán, his troops with the Burmese entered Pegu
  and invested several cities.”

  We see that the Chinese Annals, as quoted, mention only the
  “capitale primitive” _Taikung_, which I have little doubt Pauthier
  is right in identifying with _Tagaung_, traditionally the most
  ancient royal city of Burma, and the remains of which stand side
  by side with those of _Old_ Pagán, a later but still very ancient
  capital, on the east bank of the Irawadi, in about lat. 23° 28′.
  The Chinese extracts give no idea of the temporary completeness
  of the conquest, nor do they mention Great Pagán (lat. 21°
  13′), a city whose vast remains I have endeavoured partially to
  describe.[2] Sir Arthur Phayre, from a careful perusal of the
  Burmese Chronicle, assures me that there can be no doubt that
  _this_ was at the time in question the Burmese Royal Residence,
  and the city alluded to in the Burmese narrative. M. Pauthier is
  mistaken in supposing that Tarok-Mau, the turning-point of the
  Chinese Invasion, lay north of this city: he has not unnaturally
  confounded it with Tarok-_Myo_ or “China-Town,” a district not far
  below Ava. Moreover Malé, the position of the decisive victory of
  the Chinese, is itself much to the south of Tagaung (about 22° 55′).

  Both Pagán and Malé are mentioned in a remarkable Chinese notice
  extracted in _Amyot’s Mémoires_ (XIV. 292): “Mien-Tien ... had
  five chief towns, of which the first was _Kiangtheu_ (_supra_, pp.
  105, 111), the second _Taikung_, the third _Malai_, the fourth
  Ngan-cheng-kwé (? perhaps the _Nga-tshaung gyan_ of the Burmese
  Annals), the fifth PUKAN MIEN-WANG (Pagán of the Mien King?).
  The Yuen carried war into this country, particularly during the
  reign of Shun-Ti, the last Mongol Emperor [1333–1368], who, after
  subjugating it, erected at Pukan Mien-Wang a tribunal styled
  _Hwen-wei-she-sé_, the authority of which extended over Pang-ya
  and all its dependencies.” This is evidently founded on actual
  documents, for Panya or Pengya, otherwise styled Vijáyapúra, was
  the capital of Burma during part of the 14th century, between the
  decay of Pagán and the building of Ava. But none of the translated
  extracts from the Burmese Chronicle afford corroboration. From
  Sangermano’s abstract, however, we learn that the King of Panya
  from 1323 to 1343 was the _son of a daughter of the Emperor of
  China_ (p. 42). I may also refer to Pemberton’s abstract of the
  Chronicle of the Shan State of Pong in the Upper Irawadi valley,
  which relates that about the middle of the 14th century the Chinese
  invaded Pong and took Maung Maorong, the capital.[3] The Shan King
  and his son fled to the King of Burma for protection, but _the
  Burmese surrendered them_ and they were carried to China. (_Report
  on E. Frontier of Bengal_, p. 112.)

  I see no sufficient evidence as to whether Marco himself visited
  the “city of Mien.” I think it is quite clear that his account
  of the _conquest_ is from the merest hearsay, not to say gossip.
  Of the absurd story of the jugglers we find no suggestion in the
  Chinese extracts. We learn from them that Násruddin had represented
  the conquest of Mien as a very easy task, and Kúblái may have in
  jest asked his gleemen if they would undertake it. The haziness of
  Polo’s account of the conquest contrasts strongly with his graphic
  description of the rout of the elephants at Vochan. Of the latter
  he heard the particulars on the spot (I conceive) shortly after the
  event; whilst the conquest took place some years later than his
  mission to that frontier. His description of the gold and silver
  pagodas with their canopies of tinkling bells (the Burmese _Htí_),
  certainly looks like a sketch from the life;[4] and it is quite
  possible that some negotiations between 1277 and 1281 may have
  given him the opportunity of visiting Burma, though he may not have
  reached the capital. Indeed he would in that case surely have given
  a distincter account of so important a city, the aspect of which in
  its glory we have attempted to realize in the plate of “the city of
  Mien.”

  It is worthy of note that the unfortunate King then reigning
  in Pagán, had in 1274 finished a magnificent Pagoda called
  _Mengala-dzedi (Mangala Chaitya)_ respecting which ominous
  prophecies had been diffused. In this pagoda were deposited,
  besides holy relics, golden images of the Disciples of Buddha,
  golden models of the holy places, golden images of the King’s
  fifty-one predecessors in Pagán, and of the King and his Family.
  It is easy to suspect a connection of this with Marco’s story. “It
  is possible that the King’s ashes may have been intended to be
  buried near those relics, though such is not now the custom; and
  Marco appears to have confounded the custom of depositing relics
  of Buddha and ancient holy men in pagodas with the _supposed_
  custom of the burial of the dead. Still, even now, monuments are
  occasionally erected over the dead in Burma, although the practice
  is considered a vain folly. I have known a miniature pagoda with
  a _hti_ complete, erected over the ashes of a favourite disciple
  by a _P’hungyi_ or Buddhist monk.” The latter practice is common
  in China. (_Notes by Sir A. Phayre; J. A. S. B._ IV. _u.s._, also
  V. 164, VI. 251; _Mason’s Burmah_, 2nd ed. p. 26; _Milne’s Life in
  China_, pp. 288, 450.)

  NOTE 3.—The Gaur—_Bos Gaurus_, or _B. (Bibos) Cavifrons_ of
  Hodgson—exists in certain forests of the Burmese territory; and,
  in the south at least, a wild ox nearer the domestic species,
  _Bos Sondaicus_. Mr. Gouger, in his book _The Prisoner in Burma_,
  describes the rare spectacle which he once enjoyed in the
  Tenasserim forests of a herd of wild cows at graze. He speaks of
  them as small and elegant, without hump, and of a light reddish dun
  colour (pp. 326–327).

    supposes it to be _Túrk_, in which case its use probably began at
    this time.

[3] Dr. Anderson has here hastily assumed a discrepancy of sixty years
    between the chronology of the Shan document and that of the Chinese
    Annals. But this is merely because he arbitrarily identifies the
    Chinese invasion here recorded with that of Kúblái in the preceding
    century. (See _Anderson’s Western Yunnan_, p. 8.) We see in the
    quotation above from Amyot that the Chinese Annals also contain an
    obscure indication of the later invasion.

    morning causes the precious bells to tinkle with a pleasing sound.”

                              CHAPTER LV.

                  CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF BANGALA.


Bangala is a Province towards the south, which up to the year 1290,
when the aforesaid Messer Marco Polo was still at the Court of the
Great Kaan, had not yet been conquered; but his armies had gone
thither to make the conquest. You must know that this province has a
peculiar language, and that the people are wretched Idolaters. They are
tolerably close to India. There are numbers of eunuchs there, insomuch
that all the Barons who keep them get them from that Province.{1}

The people have oxen as tall as elephants, but not so big.{2} They
live on flesh and milk and rice. They grow cotton, in which they drive
a great trade, and also spices such as spikenard, galingale, ginger,
sugar, and many other sorts. And the people of India also come thither
in search of the eunuchs that I mentioned, and of slaves, male and
female, of which there are great numbers, taken from other provinces
with which those of the country are at war; and these eunuchs and
slaves are sold to the Indian and other merchants who carry them thence
for sale about the world.

There is nothing more to mention about this country, so we will quit
it, and I will tell you of another province called Caugigu.


  NOTE 1.—I do not think it probable that Marco even touched at any
  port of Bengal on that mission to the Indian Seas of which we hear
  in the prologue; but he certainly never reached it from the Yun-nan
  side, and he had, as we shall presently see (_infra_, ch. lix. note
  6), a wrong notion as to its position. Indeed, if he had visited it
  at all, he would have been aware that it was essentially a part of
  India, whilst in fact he evidently regarded it as an _Indo-Chinese_
  region, like Zardandan, Mien, and Caugigu.

  There is no notice, I believe, in any history, Indian or Chinese,
  of an attempt by Kúblái to conquer Bengal. The only such attempt
  by the Mongols that we hear of is one mentioned by Firishta, as
  made by way of Cathay and Tibet, during the reign of Aláuddin
  Masa’úd, king of Delhi, in 1244, and stated to have been defeated
  by the local officers in Bengal. But Mr. Edward Thomas tells me
  he has most distinctly ascertained that this statement, which has
  misled every historian “from Badauni and Firishtah to Briggs and
  Elphinstone, is founded purely on an erroneous reading” (and see a
  note in Mr. Thomas’s _Pathan Kings of Dehli_, p. 121).

  The date 1290 in the text would fix the period of Polo’s final
  departure from Peking, if the dates were not so generally corrupt.

  The subject of the last part of this paragraph, recurred to in the
  next, has been misunderstood and corrupted in Pauthier’s text, and
  partially in Ramusio’s. These make the _escuillés_ or _escoilliez_
  (vide _Ducange_ in v. _Escodatus_, and _Raynouard, Lex. Rom._
  VI. 11) into _scholars_ and what not. But on comparison of the
  passages in those two editions with the Geographic Text one cannot
  doubt the correct reading. As to the fact that Bengal had an evil
  notoriety for this traffic, especially the province of Silhet, see
  the _Ayeen Akbery_, II. 9–11, _Barbosa’s _chapter on Bengal, and
  _De Barros_ (_Ramusio_ I. 316 and 391).

  On the cheapness of slaves in Bengal, see _Ibn Batuta_, IV.
  211–212. He says people from Persia used to call Bengal _Dúzakh
  pur-i ni’amat_, “a hell crammed with good things,” an appellation
  perhaps provoked by the official style often applied to it of
  _Jannat-ul-balád_ or “Paradise of countries.”

  Professor H. Blochmann, who is, in admirable essays, redeeming
  the long neglect of the history and archæology of Bengal Proper
  by our own countrymen, says that one of the earliest passages, in
  which the name _Bangálah_ occurs, is in a poem of Hafiz, sent from
  Shiraz to Sultan Ghiássuddín, who reigned in Bengal from 1367 to
  1373. Its occurrence in our text, however, shows that the name
  was in use among the Mahomedan foreigners (from whom Polo derived
  his nomenclature) nearly a century earlier. And in fact it occurs
  (though corruptly in some MSS.) in the history of Rashiduddin, our
  author’s contemporary. (See _Elliot_, I. p. 72.)

  NOTE 2.—“Big as elephants” is only a _façon de parler_, but Marsden
  quotes modern exaggerations as to the height of the _Arna_ or
  wild buffalo, more specific and extravagant. The unimpeachable
  authority of Mr. Hodgson tells us that the Arna in the Nepal Tarai
  sometimes does reach a height of 6 ft. 6 in. at the shoulder, with
  a length of 10 ft. 6 in. (excluding tail), and horns of 6 ft. 6 in.
  (_J. A. S. B._, XVI. 710.) Marco, however, seems to be speaking
  of _domestic_ cattle. Some of the breeds of Upper India are very
  tall and noble animals, far surpassing in height any European oxen
  known to me; but in modern times these are rarely seen in Bengal,
  where the cattle are poor and stunted. The _Aín Akbari_, however,
  speaks of Sharífábád in Bengal, which appears to have corresponded
  to modern Bardwán, as producing very beautiful white oxen, of
  great size, and capable of carrying a load of 15 _mans_, which at
  Prinsep’s estimate of Akbar’s _man_ would be about 600 lbs.




                             CHAPTER LVI.

                DISCOURSES OF THE PROVINCE OF CAUGIGU.


Caugigu is a province towards the east, which has a king.{1} The people
are Idolaters, and have a language of their own. They have made their
submission to the Great Kaan, and send him tribute every year. And let
me tell you their king is so given to luxury that he hath at the least
300 wives; for whenever he hears of any beautiful woman in the land, he
takes and marries her.

They find in this country a good deal of gold, and they also have great
abundance of spices. But they are such a long way from the sea that
the products are of little value, and thus their price is low. They
have elephants in great numbers, and other cattle of sundry kinds, and
plenty of game. They live on flesh and milk and rice, and have wine
made of rice and good spices. The whole of the people, or nearly so,
have their skin marked with the needle in patterns representing lions,
dragons, birds, and what not, done in such a way that it can never be
obliterated. This work they cause to be wrought over face and neck
and chest, arms and hands, and belly, and, in short, the whole body;
and they look on it as a token of elegance, so that those who have
the largest amount of this embroidery are regarded with the greatest
admiration.


  NOTE 1.—No province mentioned by Marco has given rise to wider and
  wilder conjectures than this, _Cangigu_ as it has been generally
  printed.

  M. Pauthier, who sees in it Laos, or rather one of the states of
  Laos called in the Chinese histories _Papesifu_, seems to have
  formed the most probable opinion hitherto propounded by any editor
  of Polo. I have no doubt that Laos or some part of that region
  is meant to be _described_, and that Pauthier is right regarding
  the general direction of the course here taken as being through
  the regions east of Burma, in a north-easterly direction up into
  Kwei-chau. But we shall be able to review the geography of this
  tract better, as a whole, at a point more advanced. I shall then
  speak of the name CAUGIGU, and why I prefer this reading of it.

  I do not believe, for reasons which will also appear further on,
  that Polo is now following a route which he had traced in person,
  unless it be in the latter part of it.

  M. Pauthier, from certain indications in a Chinese work, fixes on
  Chiangmai or Kiang-mai, the Zimmé of the Burmese (in about latitude
  18° 48′ and long. 99° 30′) as the capital of the Papesifu and of
  the Caugigu of our text. It can scarcely however be the latter,
  unless we throw over entirely all the intervals stated in Polo’s
  itinerary; and M. Garnier informs me that he has evidence that the
  capital of the Papesifu at this time was _Muang-Yong_, a little to
  the south-east of Kiang-Tung, where he has seen its ruins.[1] That
  the people called by the Chinese Papesifu were of the great race of
  Laotians, Sháns, or _Thai_, is very certain, from the vocabulary of
  their language published by Klaproth.

  [Illustration: Script _Pa-pe_.]

  Pauthier’s Chinese authority gives a puerile interpretation of
  _Papesifu_ as signifying “the kingdom of the 800 wives,” and says
  it was called so because the Prince maintained that establishment.
  This may be an indication that there were popular stories about
  the numerous wives of the King of Laos, such as Polo had heard;
  but the interpretation is doubtless rubbish, like most of the
  so-called etymologies of proper names applied by the Chinese to
  foreign regions. At best these seem to be merely a kind of _Memoria
  Technica_, and often probably bear no more relation to the name
  in its real meaning than Swift’s _All-eggs-under-the-grate_ bears
  to Alexander Magnus. How such “etymologies” arise is obvious
  from the nature of the Chinese system of writing. If we also had
  to express proper names by combining monosyllabic words already
  existing in English, we should in fact be obliged to write the name
  of the Macedonian hero much as Swift travestied it. As an example
  we may give the Chinese name of Java, _Kwawa_, which signifies
  “gourd-sound,” and was given to that Island, we are told, because
  the voice of its inhabitants is very like that of a dry gourd
  rolled upon the ground! It is usually stated that Tungking was
  called _Kiao-chi_, meaning “crossed-toes,” because the people often
  exhibit that malformation (which is a fact), but we may be certain
  that the syllables were originally a phonetic representation of an
  indigenous name which has no such meaning. As another example, less
  ridiculous but not more true, _Chin-tan_, representing the Indian
  name of China, _Chínasthána_, is explained to mean “Eastern-Dawn”
  (_Aurore Orientale_). (_Amyot_, XIV. 101; _Klapr. Mém._ III. 268.)

  The states of Laos are shut out from the sea in the manner
  indicated; they abound in domestic elephants to an extraordinary
  extent; and the people do tattoo themselves in various degrees,
  most of all (as M. Garnier tells me) about Kiang Hung. The _style_
  of tattooing which the text describes is quite that of the Burmese,
  in speaking of whom Polo has omitted to mention the custom: “Every
  male Burman is tattooed in his boyhood from the middle to his
  knees; in fact he has a pair of breeches tattooed on him. The
  pattern is a fanciful medley of animals and arabesques, but it is
  scarcely distinguishable, save as a general tint, except on a fair
  skin.” (_Mission to Ava_, 151.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] Indeed documents in Klaproth’s _Asia Polyglotta_ show that the
    _Papé_ state was also called _Muang-Yong_ (pp. 364–365). I observe
    that the river running to the east of Pu-eul and Ssemao (Puer and
    Esmok) is called _Papien_-Kiang, the name of which is perhaps a
    memorial of the Papé.

    [The old Laocian kingdom of _Xieng-maï_ [Kiang-mai], called
    _Muong-Yong_ by the Pa-y, was inhabited by the _Pa-pe Si-fu_ or
    Bát-bá T’úc-phu; the inhabitants called themselves Thaï-niai or
    great Thaï. (_Devéria, Frontière_, p. 100.) Ch. ix. of the Chinese
    work _Sze-i-kwan-kao_ is devoted to Xieng-maï (_Pa-pe_), which
    includes the subdivisions of Laos, Xieng Hung [Kiang Hung] and
    Muong-Ken. (_Devéria, Mél. de Harlez_, p. 97.)—H. C.]




                             CHAPTER LVII.

                   CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF ANIN.


Anin is a Province towards the east, the people of which are subject to
the Great Kaan, and are Idolaters. They live by cattle and tillage, and
have a peculiar language. The women wear on the legs and arms bracelets
of gold and silver of great value, and the men wear such as are even
yet more costly. They have plenty of horses which they sell in great
numbers to the Indians, making a great profit thereby. And they have
also vast herds of buffaloes and oxen, having excellent pastures for
these. They have likewise all the necessaries of life in abundance.{1}

Now you must know that between Anin and Caugigu, which we have left
behind us, there is a distance of [25] days’ journey;{2} and from
Caugigu to Bangala, the third province in our rear, is 30 days’
journey. We shall now leave Anin and proceed to another province which
is some 8 days’ journey further, always going eastward.


  NOTE 1.—Ramusio, the printed text of the Soc. de Géographie, and
  most editions have _Amu_; Pauthier reads _Aniu_, and considers the
  name to represent Tungking or Annam, called also _Nan-yué_. The
  latter word he supposes to be converted into _Anyuë_, _Aniu_. And
  accordingly he carries the traveller to the capital of Tungking.

  Leaving the name for the present, according to the scheme of the
  route as I shall try to explain it below, I should seek for Amu
  or Aniu or _Anin_ in the extreme south-east of Yun-nan. A part of
  this region was for the first time traversed by the officers of the
  French expedition up the Mekong, who in 1867 visited Sheu-ping,
  Lin-ngan and the upper valley of the River of Tungking on their
  way to Yun-nan-fu. To my question whether the description in the
  text, of Aniu or Anin and its fine pastures, applied to the tract
  just indicated, Lieut. Garnier replied on the whole favourably
  (see further on), proceeding: “The population about Sheu-ping is
  excessively mixt. On market days at that town one sees a gathering
  of wild people in great number and variety, and whose costumes
  are highly picturesque, as well as often very rich. There are the
  _Pa-is_, who are also found again higher up, the _Ho-nhi_, the
  _Khato_, the _Lopé_, the _Shentseu_. These tribes appear to be
  allied in part to the Laotians, in part to the Kakhyens.... The
  wilder races about Sheuping are remarkably handsome, and you see
  there types of women exhibiting an extraordinary regularity of
  feature, and at the same time a complexion surprisingly _white_.
  The Chinese look quite an inferior race beside them.... I may add
  that all these tribes, especially the Ho-nhi and the Pa-ï, wear
  large amounts of silver ornament; great collars of silver round the
  neck, as well as on the legs and arms.”

  Though the _whiteness_ of the people of Anin is not noticed by
  Polo, the distinctive manner in which he speaks in the next chapter
  of the _dark_ complexion of the tribes described therein seems to
  indicate the probable omission of the opposite trait here.

  The prominent position assigned in M. Garnier’s remarks to a race
  called _Ho-nhi_ first suggested to me that the reading of the text
  might be ANIN instead of _Aniu_. And as a matter of fact this
  seems to my eyes to be clearly the reading of the Paris _Livre
  des Merveilles_ (Pauthier’s MS. B), while the Paris No. 5631
  (Pauthier’s A) has _Auin_, and what may be either _Aniu_ or _Anin_.
  _Anyn_ is also found in the Latin Brandenburg MS. of Pipino’s
  version collated by Andrew Müller, to which, however, we cannot
  ascribe much weight. But the two words are so nearly identical
  in mediæval writing, and so little likely to be discriminated by
  scribes who had nothing to guide their discrimination, that one
  need not hesitate to adopt that which is supported by argument.
  In reference to the suggested identity of _Anin_ and _Ho-nhi_, M.
  Garnier writes again: “All that Polo has said regarding the country
  of Aniu, though not containing anything _very_ characteristic, may
  apply perfectly to the different indigenous tribes, at present
  subject to the Chinese, which are dispersed over the country from
  Talan to Sheuping and Lin-ngan. These tribes bearing the names
  (given above) relate that they in other days formed an independent
  state, to which they give the name of _Muang Shung_. Where this
  Muang was situated there is no knowing. These tribes have _langage
  par euls_, as Marco Polo says, and silver ornaments are worn by
  them to this day in extraordinary profusion; more, however, by
  the women than the men. They have plenty of horses, buffaloes and
  oxen, and of sheep as well. It was the first locality in which the
  latter were seen. The plateau of Lin-ngan affords pasture-grounds
  which are exceptionally good for that part of the world.

  [Illustration: Ho-nhi and other Tribes in the Department of
    Lin-ngan in S. Yun-nan (supposed to be the Anin country of Marco
    Polo). (From Garnier’s Work.)]

  “Beyond Lin-ngan we find the Ho-nhi, properly so called, no longer.
  But ought one to lay much stress on mere names which have undergone
  so many changes, and of which so many have been borne in succession
  by all those places and peoples?... I will content myself with
  reminding you that the town of _Homi-cheu_ near Lin-ngan in the
  days of the Yuen bore the name of _Ngo-ning_.”

  Notwithstanding M. Garnier’s caution, I am strongly inclined to
  believe that ANIN represents either HO-NHI or NGO-NING, if indeed
  these names be not identical. For on reference to Biot I see that
  the first syllable of the modern name of the town which M. Garnier
  writes HO_mí_, is expressed by the same character as the first
  syllable of NGO_ning_.

  [The Wo-nhi are also called Ngo-ni, Kan-ni, Ho-ni, Lou-mi, No-pi,
  Ko-ni and Wa-heh; they descend from the southern barbarians called
  Ho-nhi. At the time of the kingdom of Nan-Chao, the Ho-nhi, called
  In-yuen, tribes were a dependence of the Kiang (Xieng) of Wei-yuen
  (Prefecture of P’u-erh). They are now to be found in the Yunnanese
  prefectures of Lin-ngan, King-tung, Chen-yuen, Yuen-kiang and
  Yun-nan. (See _Devéria_, p. 135.)—H. C.]

  We give one of M. Garnier’s woodcuts representing some of the races
  in this vicinity. Their dress, as he notices, has, in some cases,
  a curious resemblance to costumes of Switzerland, or of Brittany,
  popular at fancy balls.[1] Coloured figures of some of these races
  will be found in the Atlas to Garnier’s work; see especially Plate
  35.

  NOTE 2.—All the French MSS. and other texts except Ramusio’s read
  15. We adopt Ramusio’s reading, 25, for reasons which will appear
  below.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] There is a little uncertainty in the adjustment of names and
    figures of some of these tribes, between the illustrations and
    the incidental notices in Lieutenant Garnier’s work. But all the
    figures in the present cut certainly belong to the tract to which
    we point as Anin; and the two middle figures answer best to what is
    said of the _Ho-nhi_.




                            CHAPTER LVIII.

                  CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF COLOMAN.


Coloman is a province towards the east, the people of which are
Idolaters and have a peculiar language, and are subject to the Great
Kaan. They are a [tall and] very handsome people, though in complexion
brown rather than white, and are good soldiers.{1} They have a good
many towns, and a vast number of villages, among great mountains, and
in strong positions.{2}

When any of them die, the bodies are burnt, and then they take the
bones and put them in little chests. These are carried high up the
mountains, and placed in great caverns, where they are hung up in such
wise that neither man nor beast can come at them.

A good deal of gold is found in the country, and for petty traffic
they use porcelain shells such as I have told you of before. All these
provinces that I have been speaking of, to wit Bangala and Caugigu
and Anin, employ for currency porcelain shells and gold. There are
merchants in this country who are very rich and dispose of large
quantities of goods. The people live on flesh and rice and milk, and
brew their wine from rice and excellent spices.


  NOTE 1.—The only MSS. that afford the reading _Coloman_ or
  _Choloman_ instead of _Toloman_ or _Tholoman_, are the Bern MS.,
  which has _Coloman_ in the initial word of the chapter, Paris
  MS. 5649 (Pauthier’s C) which has _Coloman_ in the Table of
  Chapters, but not in the text, the Bodleian, and the Brandenburg
  MS. quoted in the last note. These variations in themselves have
  little weight. But the confusion between _c_ and _t_ in mediæval
  MSS., when dealing with strange names, is so constant that I have
  ventured to make the correction, in strong conviction that it is
  the right reading. M. Pauthier indeed, after speaking of tribes
  called _Lo_ on the south-west of China, adds, “on les nommait
  _To-lo-man_ (‘les nombreux Barbares Lo’).” Were this latter
  statement founded on actual evidence we might retain that form
  which is the usual reading. But I apprehend from the manner in
  which M. Pauthier produces it, without corroborative quotation,
  that he is rather hazarding a conjecture than speaking with
  authority. Be that as it may, it is impossible that Polo’s Toloman
  or Coloman should have been in the south of Kwangsi, where Pauthier
  locates it.

  On the other hand, we find tribes of both _Kolo_ and _Kihlau_
  Barbarians (_i.e._ _Mán_, whence KOLO-MÁN or _Kihlau-mán_) very
  numerous on the frontier of Kweichau. (See _Bridgman’s transl.
  of Tract on Meautsze_, pp. 265, 269, 270, 272, 273, 274, 275,
  278, 279, 280.) Among these the _Kolo_, described as No. 38 in
  that Tract, appear to me from various particulars to be the most
  probable representatives of the Coloman of Polo, notwithstanding
  the sentence with which the description opens: “_Kolo_ originally
  called _Luluh_; the modern designation _Kolo_ is incorrect.”[1]
  They are at present found in the prefecture of Tating (one of the
  departments of Kweichau towards the Yun-nan side). “They are _tall,
  of a dark complexion_, with sunken eyes, aquiline nose, wear long
  whiskers, and have the beard shaved off above the mouth. They pay
  great deference to demons, and on that account are sometimes called
  ‘Dragons of Lo.’... At the present time these Kolo are divided
  into 48 clans, the elders of which are called Chieftains (lit.
  ‘Head-and-Eyes’) and are of nine grades.... The men bind their hair
  into a tuft with blue cloth and make it fast on the forehead like a
  horn. Their upper dresses are short, with large sleeves, and their
  lower garments are fine blue. When one of the chieftains dies, all
  that were under him are assembled together clad in armour and on
  horseback. Having dressed his corpse in silk and woollen robes,
  they burn it in the open country; then, invoking the departed
  spirit, they inter the ashes. Their attachment to him as their
  sole master is such that nothing can drive or tempt them from their
  allegiance. Their large bows, long spears, and sharp swords, are
  strong and well-wrought. They train excellent horses, love archery
  and hunting; and so expert are they in tactics that _their soldiers
  rank as the best among all the uncivilized tribes_. There is this
  proverb: ‘The Lo Dragons of Shwui-si rap the head and strike the
  tail,’ which is intended to indicate their celerity in defence.”
  (_Bridgman_, pp. 272–273.)

  The character _Lo_, here applied in the Chinese Tract to these
  people, is the same as that in the name of the Kwangsi _Lo_ of M.
  Pauthier.

  I append a cut (opposite page) from the drawing representing these
  Kolo-man in the original work from which Bridgman translated, and
  which is in the possession of Dr. Lockhart.

  [I believe we must read _To-lo-man_. _Man_, barbarian, _T’u-lao_ or
  _Shan-tzŭ_ (mountaineers) who live in the Yunnanese prefectures of
  Lin-ngan, Cheng-kiang, etc. T’u-la-Man or T’u-la barbarians of the
  Mongol Annals. (_Yuen-shi lei-pien_, quoted by Devéria, p. 115.)—H.
  C.]

  NOTE 2.—Magaillans, speaking of the semi-independent tribes of
  Kwei-chau and Kwang-si, says: “Their towns are usually so girt by
  high mountains and scarped rocks that it seems as if nature had
  taken a pleasure in fortifying them” (p. 43). (See cut at p. 131.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] On the other hand, M. Garnier writes: “I do not know any name at
    all like _Kolo_, except _Lolo_, the generic name given by the
    Chinese to the wild tribes of Yun-nan.” Does not this look as if
    _Kolo_ were really the old name, _Luluh_ or Lolo the later?




                             CHAPTER LIX.

                   CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF CUIJU.


Cuiju is a province towards the East.{1} After leaving Coloman you
travel along a river for 12 days, meeting with a good number of towns
and villages, but nothing worthy of particular mention. After you have
travelled those twelve days along the river you come to a great and
noble city which is called FUNGUL.

The people are Idolaters and subject to the Great Kaan, and live by
trade and handicrafts. You must know they manufacture stuffs of the
bark of certain trees which form very fine summer clothing.{2} They
are good soldiers, and have paper-money. For you must understand that
henceforward we are in the countries where the Great Kaan’s paper-money
is current.

[Illustration: The Koloman, after a Chinese drawing.

  “=Coloman est une provence vers levant.... Il sunt mult belles jens
  et ne sunt mie bien blances mès brunz. Il sunt bien homes d’armes
  ...=”]

The country swarms with lions to that degree that no man can venture to
sleep outside his house at night.{3} Moreover, when you travel on that
river, and come to a halt at night, unless you keep a good way from the
bank the lions will spring on the boat and snatch one of the crew and
make off with him and devour him. And but for a certain help that the
inhabitants enjoy, no one could venture to travel in that province,
because of the multitude of those lions, and because of their strength
and ferocity.

But you see they have in this province a large breed of dogs, so fierce
and bold that two of them together will attack a lion.{4} So every man
who goes a journey takes with him a couple of those dogs, and when
a lion appears they have at him with the greatest boldness, and the
lion turns on them, but can’t touch them for they are very deft at
eschewing his blows. So they follow him, perpetually giving tongue, and
watching their chance to give him a bite in the rump or in the thigh,
or wherever they may. The lion makes no reprisal except now and then
to turn fiercely on them, and then indeed were he to catch the dogs
it would be all over with them, but they take good care that he shall
not. So, to escape the dogs’ din, the lion makes off, and gets into the
wood, where mayhap he stands at bay against a tree to have his rear
protected from their annoyance. And when the travellers see the lion
in this plight they take to their bows, for they are capital archers,
and shoot their arrows at him till he falls dead. And ’tis thus that
travellers in those parts do deliver themselves from those lions.

They have a good deal of silk and other products which are carried up
and down, by the river of which we spoke, into various quarters.{5}

You travel along the river for twelve days more, finding a good
many towns all along, and the people always Idolaters, and subject
to the Great Kaan, with paper-money current, and living by trade
and handicrafts. There are also plenty of fighting men. And after
travelling those twelve days you arrive at the city of Sindafu of
which we spoke in this book some time ago.{6}

From Sindafu you set out again and travel some 70 days through the
provinces and cities and towns which we have already visited, and all
which have been already particularly spoken of in our Book. At the end
of those 70 days you come to Juju where we were before.{7}

From Juju you set out again and travel four days towards the south,
finding many towns and villages. The people are great traders and
craftsmen, are all Idolaters, and use the paper-money of the Great Kaan
their Sovereign. At the end of those four days you come to the city
of Cacanfu belonging to the province of Cathay, and of it I shall now
speak.


  NOTE 1.—In spite of difficulties which beset the subject (see Note
  6 below) the view of Pauthier, suggested doubtingly by Marsden,
  that the Cuiju of the text is KWEI-CHAU, seems the most probable
  one. As the latter observes, the reappearance of paper money
  shows that we have got back into a province of China Proper.
  Such, Yun-nan, recently conquered from a Shan prince, could not
  be considered. But, according to the best view we can form, the
  traveller could only have passed through the extreme west of the
  province of Kwei-chau.

  The name of _Fungul_, if that be a true reading, is suggestive
  of _Phungan_, which under the Mongols was the head of a district
  called PHUNGAN-LU. It was founded by that dynasty, and was regarded
  as an important position for the command of the three provinces
  Kwei-chau, Kwang-si, and Yun-nan. (_Biot_, p. 168; _Martini_, p.
  137.) But we shall explain presently the serious difficulties that
  beset the interpretation of the itinerary as it stands.

  NOTE 2.—Several Chinese plants afford a fibre from the bark, and
  some of these are manufactured into what we call _grass-cloths_.
  The light smooth textures so called are termed by the Chinese
  _Hiapu_ or “summer cloths.” Kwei-chau produces such. But perhaps
  that specially intended is a species of hemp (_Urtica Nivea?_)
  of which M. Perny of the R. C. Missions says, in his notes
  on Kwei-chau: “It affords a texture which may be compared to
  _batiste_. This has the notable property of keeping so cool that
  many people cannot wear it even in the hot weather. Generally it
  is used only for summer clothing.” (_Dict. des Tissus_, VII. 404;
  _Chin. Repos._ XVIII. 217 and 529; _Ann. de la Prop. de la Foi_,
  XXXI. 137.)

  NOTE 3.—Tigers of course are meant. (See _supra_, vol. i. p. 399.)
  M. Perny speaks of tigers in the mountainous parts of Kwei-chau.
  (_Op. cit._ 139.)

  NOTE 4.—These great dogs were noticed by Lieutenant (now General)
  Macleod, in his journey to Kiang Hung on the great River Mekong, as
  accompanying the caravans of Chinese traders on their way to the
  Siamese territory. (See _Macleod’s Journal_, p. 66.)

  NOTE 5.—The trade in wild silk (_i.e._ from the oak-leaf silkworm)
  is in truth an important branch of commerce in Kwei-chau. But the
  chief seat of this is at Tsuni-fu, and I do not think that Polo’s
  route can be sought so far to the eastward. (_Ann. de la Prop._
  XXXI. 136; _Richthofen_, Letter VII. 81.)

  NOTE 6.—We have now got back to Sindafu, _i.e._ Ch’êng-tu fu in
  Sze-ch’wan, and are better able to review the geography of the
  track we have been following. I do not find it possible to solve
  all its difficulties.

  The different provinces treated of in the chapters from lv. to lix.
  are strung by Marco upon an easterly, or, as we must interpret,
  _north-easterly_ line of travel, real or hypothetical. Their names
  and intervals are as follows: (1) Bangala; whence 30 marches to
  (2) Caugigu; 25 marches to (3) Anin; 8 marches to (4) Toloman or
  Coloman; 12 days in Cuiju along a river to the city of (5) Fungul,
  Sinugul (or what not); 12 days further, on or along the same river,
  to (6) Ch’êng-tu fu. Total from Bangala to Ch’êng-tu fu 87 days.

  I have said that the line of travel is real _or hypothetical_, for
  no doubt a large part of it was only founded on hearsay. We last
  left our traveller at Mien, or on the frontier of Yun-nan and Mien.
  _Bangala_ is reached _per saltum_ with no indication of interval,
  and its position is entirely misapprehended. Marco conceives of
  it, not as in India, but as being, like Mien, a province _on the
  confines_ of India, as being under the same king as Mien, as lying
  to the south of that kingdom, and as being at the (south) western
  extremity of a great traverse line which runs (north) east into
  Kwei-chau and Sze-ch’wan. All these conditions point consistently
  to one locality; that, however, is not Bengal but _Pegu_. On the
  other hand, the circumstances of manners and products, so far as
  they go, _do_ belong to Bengal. I conceive that Polo’s information
  regarding these was derived from persons who had really visited
  Bengal by sea, but that he had confounded what he so heard of the
  Delta of the Ganges with what he heard on the Yun-nan frontier of
  the Delta of the Irawadi. It is just the same kind of error that is
  made about those great Eastern Rivers by Fra Mauro in his Map. And
  possibly the name of Pegu (in Burmese _Bagóh_) may have contributed
  to his error, as well as the probable fact that the Kings of
  Burma did at this time _claim_ to be Kings of Bengal, whilst they
  actually _were_ Kings of Pegu.

  _Caugigu_.—We have seen reason to agree with M. Pauthier that
  the description of this region points to Laos, though we cannot
  with him assign it to Kiang-mai. Even if it be identical with the
  Papesifu of the Chinese, we have seen that the centre of that
  state may be placed at Muang Yong not far from the Mekong; whilst
  I believe that the limits of Caugigu must be drawn much nearer the
  Chinese and Tungking territory, so as to embrace Kiang Hung, and
  probably the _Papien_ River. (See note at p. 117.)

  As regards the name, it is _possible_ that it may represent
  some specific name of the Upper Laos territory. But I am
  inclined to believe that we are dealing with a case of erroneous
  geographical perspective like that of Bangala; and that whilst the
  _circumstances_ belong to Upper Laos, the _name_, read as I read
  it, _Caugigu_ (or Cavgigu), is no other than the _Ḳafchikúe_ of
  Rashiduddin, the name applied by him to Tungking, and representing
  the KIAOCHI-KWÊ of the Chinese. D’Anville’s Atlas brings Kiaochi
  up to the Mekong in immediate contact with Che-li or Kiang Hung. I
  had come to the conclusion that Caugigu was _probably_ the correct
  reading before I was aware that it is an _actual_ reading of the
  Geog. Text more than once, of Pauthier’s A more than once, of
  Pauthier’s C _at least_ once and possibly twice, and of the Bern
  MS.; all which I have ascertained from personal examination of
  those manuscripts.[1]

  _Anin_ or _Aniu_.—I have already pointed out that I seek this
  in the territory about Lin-ngan and Homi. In relation to this
  M. Garnier writes: “In starting from Muang Yong, or even if you
  prefer it, from Xieng Hung (Kiang Hung of our maps), ... it would
  be physically impossible in 25 days to get beyond the arc which I
  have laid down on your map (viz. extending a few miles north-east
  of Homi). There are scarcely any roads in those mountains, and
  easy lines of communication begin only _after_ you have got to the
  Lin-ngan territory. In Marco Polo’s days things were certainly not
  better, but the reverse. All that has been done of consequence in
  the way of roads, posts, and organisation in the part of Yun-nan
  between Lin-ngan and Xieng Hung, dates in some degree from the
  Yuen, but in a far greater degree from K’ang-hi.” Hence, even with
  the Ramusian reading of the itinerary, we cannot place _Anin_ much
  beyond the position indicated already.

  [Illustration: Script _thaï_ of Xieng-hung.]

  _Koloman_.—We have seen that the position of this region is
  probably near the western frontier of Kwei-chau. Adhering to
  _Homi_ as the representative of Anin, and to the 8 days’ journey
  of the text, the most probable position of Koloman would be about
  _Lo-ping_, which lies about 100 English miles in a straight line
  north-east from Homi. The first character of the name here is again
  the same as the _Lo_ of the Kolo tribes.

  Beyond this point the difficulties of devising an interpretation,
  consistent at once with facts and with the text as it stands,
  become insuperable.

  The narrative demands that from Koloman we should reach _Fungul_, a
  great and noble city, by travelling 12 days along a river, and that
  Fungul should be within twelve days’ journey of Ch’êng-tu fu, along
  the same river, or at least along rivers connected with it.

  In advancing from the south-west guided by the data afforded by
  the texts, we have not been able to carry the position of Fungul
  (_Sinugul_, or what not of G. T. and other MSS.) further north than
  Phungan. But it is impossible that Ch’êng-tu fu should have been
  reached in 12 days from this point. Nor is it possible that a new
  post in a secluded position, like Phungan, could have merited to be
  described as “a great and noble city.”

  Baron v. Richthofen has favoured me with a note in which he shows
  that in reality the only place answering the more essential
  conditions of Fungul is Siu-chau fu at the union of the two
  great branches of the Yang-tzŭ, viz. the Kin-sha Kiang, and the
  Min-Kiang from Ch’êng-tu fu. (1) The distance from Siu-chau to
  Ch’êng-tu by land travelling is just about 12 days, and the road
  is along a river. (2) In approaching “Fungul” from the south Polo
  met with a good many towns and villages. This would be the case
  along either of the navigable rivers that join the Yang-tzŭ below
  Siu-chau (or along that which joins above Siu-chau, mentioned
  further on). (3) The large trade in silk up and down the river is a
  characteristic that could only apply to the Yang-tzŭ.

  These reasons are very strong, though some little doubt must
  subsist until we can explain the name (Fungul, or Sinugul) as
  applicable to Siu-chau.[2] And assuming Siu-chau to be the city we
  must needs carry the position of _Coloman_ considerably further
  north than Lo-ping, and must presume the interval between _Anin_
  and _Coloman_ to be greatly understated, through clerical or other
  error. With these assumptions we should place Polo’s Coloman in the
  vicinity of Wei-ning, one of the localities of Kolo tribes.

  From a position near Wei-ning it would be quite possible to reach
  Siu-chau in 12 days, making use of the facilities afforded by one
  or other of the partially navigable rivers to which allusion has
  just been made.

  [Illustration: Iron Suspension Bridge at Lowatong. (From Garnier.)]

  “That one,” says M. Garnier in a letter, “which enters the Kiang
  a little above Siu-chau fu, the River of _Lowa-tong_, which was
  descended by our party, has a branch to the eastward which is
  navigable up to about the latitude of Chao-tong. Is not this
  probably Marco Polo’s route? It is to this day a line much
  frequented, and one on which great works have been executed; among
  others two iron suspension bridges, works truly gigantic for the
  country in which we find them.”

  An extract from a Chinese Itinerary of this route, which M. Garnier
  has since communicated to me, shows that at a point 4 days from
  Wei-ning the traveller may embark and continue his voyage to any
  point on the great Kiang.

  We are obliged, indeed, to give up the attempt to keep to a line of
  communicating rivers throughout the whole 24 days. Nor do I see how
  it is possible to adhere to that condition literally without taking
  more material liberties with the text.

  [Illustration: MARCO POLO’S ITINERARIES Nᵒ. V.

    Indo Chinese Regions (Book II, Chapˢ. 44–59)]

  My theory of Polo’s actual journey would be that he returned from
  Yun-nan fu to Ch’êng-tu fu through some part of the province of
  Kwei-chau, perhaps only its western extremity, but that he spoke of
  Caugigu, and probably of Anin, as he did of Bangala, from report
  only. And, in recapitulation, I would identify provisionally the
  localities spoken of in this difficult itinerary as follows:
  _Caugigu_ with Kiang Hung; _Anin_ with Homi; _Coloman_ with the
  country about Wei-ning in Western Kwei-chau; _Fungul_ or Sinugul
  with Siu-chau.

  [This itinerary is difficult, as Sir Henry Yule says. It takes
  Marco Polo 24 days to go from Coloman or Toloman to Ch’êng-tu. The
  land route is 22 days from Yun-nan fu to Swi-fu, _viâ_ Tung-ch’wan
  and Chao-t’ung. (_J. China B. R. A. S._ XXVIII. 74–75.) From the
  Toloman province, which I place about Lin-ngan and Cheng-kiang,
  south of Yun-nan fu, Polo must have passed a second time through
  this city, which is indeed at the end of all the routes of this
  part of South-Western China. He might go back to Sze-ch’wan by the
  western route, _viâ_ Tung-ch’wan and Chao-t’ung to Swi-fu, or, by
  the eastern, easier and shorter route by Siuen-wei chau, crossing
  a corner of the Kwei-chau province (Wei-ning), and passing by
  Yun-ning hien to the Kiang; this is the route followed by Mr. A.
  Hosie in 1883 and by Mr. F. S. A. Bourne in 1885, and with great
  likelihood by Marco Polo; he may have taken the Yun-ning River to
  the district city of Na-ch’i hien, which lies on the right bank
  both of this river and of the Kiang; the Kiang up to Swi-fu and
  thence to Ch’êng-tu. I do not attempt to explain the difficulty
  about Fungul.

  I fully agree with Sir H. Yule when he says that Polo spoke of
  Caugigu and of Bangala, probably of Anin, from report only.
  However, I believe that Caugigu is the _Kiao-Chi kwé_ of the
  Chinese, that Ani_n_ must be read Ani_u_, that Aniu is but
  a transcription of _Nan-yué_, that both Nan-yué and Kiao-Chi
  represent Northern Annam, _i.e._ the portion of Annam which we call
  Tung-king. Regarding the tattooed inhabitants of Caugigu, let it be
  remembered that tattooing existed in Annam till it was prohibited
  by the Chinese during the occupation of Tung-king at the beginning
  of the 15th century.—H. C.]

  NOTE 7.—Here the traveller gets back to the road-bifurcation near
  Juju, _i.e._ Chochau (_ante_ p. 11), and thence commences to travel
  southward.

                              CHAPTER LX.

           CONCERNING THE CITIES OF CACANFU AND OF CHANGLU.


Cacanfu is a noble city. The people are Idolaters and burn their dead;
they have paper-money, and live by trade and handicrafts. For they
have plenty of silk from which they weave stuffs of silk and gold, and
sendals in large quantities. [There are also certain Christians at this
place, who have a church.] And the city is at the head of an important
territory containing numerous towns and villages. [A great river
passes through it, on which much merchandise is carried to the city of
Cambaluc, for by many channels and canals it is connected therewith.{1}]

We will now set forth again, and travel three days towards the south,
and then we come to a town called CHANGLU. This is another great city
belonging to the Great Kaan, and to the province of Cathay. The people
have paper-money, and are Idolaters and burn their dead. And you must
know they make salt in great quantities at this place; I will tell you
how ’tis done.{2}

A kind of earth is found there which is exceedingly salt. This they
dig up and pile in great heaps. Upon these heaps they pour water in
quantities till it runs out at the bottom; and then they take up this
water and boil it well in great iron cauldrons, and as it cools it
deposits a fine white salt in very small grains. This salt they then
carry about for sale to many neighbouring districts, and get great
profit thereby.

There is nothing else worth mentioning, so let us go forward five days’
journey, and we shall come to a city called Chinangli.


  NOTE 1.—In the greater part of the journey which occupies the
  remainder of Book II., Pauthier is a chief authority, owing
  to his industrious Chinese reading and citation. Most of his
  identifications seem well founded, though sometimes we shall be
  constrained to dissent from them widely. A considerable number have
  been anticipated by former editors, but even in such cases he is
  often able to bring forward new grounds.

  CACANFU is HO-KIEN FU in Pe Chih-li, 52 miles in a direct line
  south by east of Chochau. It was the head of one of the _Lu_ or
  circuits into which the Mongols divided China. (_Pauthier_.)

  NOTE 2.—Marsden and Murray have identified Changlu with T’SANG-CHAU
  in Pe Chih-li, about 30 miles east by south of Ho-kien fu. This
  seems substantially right, but Pauthier shows that there was an old
  town actually called CH’ANGLU, separated from T’sang-chau only by
  the great canal. [Ch’ang-lu was the name of T’sang-chau under the
  T’ang and the Kin. (See _Playfair, Dict._, p. 34.)—H. C.]

  The manner of obtaining salt, described in the text, is
  substantially the same as one described by Duhalde, and by one of
  the missionaries, as being employed near the mouth of the Yang-tzŭ
  kiang. There is a town of the third order some miles south-east
  of T’sang-chau, called _Yen-shan_ or “salt-hill,” and, according
  to Pauthier, T’sang-chau is the mart for salt produced there.
  (_Duhalde_ in _Astley_, IV. 310; _Lettres Edif._ XI. 267 _seqq._;
  _Biot._ p. 283.)

  Polo here introduces a remark about the practice of burning the
  dead, which, with the notice of the idolatry of the people, and
  their use of paper-money, constitutes a formula which he repeats
  all through the Chinese provinces with wearisome iteration. It is,
  in fact, his definition of the Chinese people, for whom he seems to
  lack a comprehensive name.

  A great change seems to have come over Chinese custom, since the
  Middle Ages, in regard to the disposal of the dead. Cremation
  is now entirely disused, except in two cases; one, that of the
  obsequies of a Buddhist priest, and the other that in which the
  coffin instead of being buried has been exposed in the fields, and
  in the lapse of time has become decayed. But it is impossible to
  reject the evidence that it was a common practice in Polo’s age.
  He repeats the assertion that it was _the_ custom at every stage
  of his journey through Eastern China; though perhaps his taking
  absolutely no notice of the practice of burial is an instance of
  that imperfect knowledge of strictly Chinese peculiarities which
  has been elsewhere ascribed to him. It is the case, however, that
  the author of the Book of the Estate of the Great Kaan (_circa_
  1330) also speaks of cremation as the usual Chinese practice,
  and that Ibn Batuta says positively: “The Chinese are infidels
  and idolaters, and they burn their dead after the manner of the
  Hindus.” This is all the more curious, because the Arab _Relations_
  of the 9th century say distinctly that the Chinese bury their dead,
  though they often kept the body long (as they do still) before
  burial; and there is no mistaking the description which Conti (15th
  century) gives of the Chinese mode of sepulture. Mendoza, in the
  16th century, alludes to no disposal of the dead except by burial,
  but Semedo in the early part of the 17th says that bodies were
  occasionally burnt, especially in Sze-ch’wan.

  I am greatly indebted to the kindness of an eminent Chinese
  scholar, Mr. W. F. Mayers, of Her Majesty’s Legation at Peking,
  who, in a letter, dated Peking, 18th September, 1874, sends me the
  following memorandum on the subject:—

  “_Colonel Yule’s Marco Polo_, II. 97 [First Edition], _Burning of
  the Dead_.

  “On this subject compare the article entitled _Huo Tsang_, or
  ‘Cremation Burials,’ in Bk. XV of the _Jih Che Luh_, or ‘Daily
  Jottings,’ a great collection of miscellaneous notes on classical,
  historical, and antiquarian subjects, by Ku Yen-wu, a celebrated
  author of the 17th century. The article is as follows:—

  “‘The practice of burning the dead flourished (or flourishes) most
  extensively in Kiang-nan, and was in vogue already in the period
  of the Sung Dynasty. According to the history of the Sung Dynasty,
  in the 27th year of the reign Shao-hing (A.D. 1157), the practice
  was animadverted upon by a public official.’ Here follows a long
  extract, in which the burning of the dead is reprehended, and it is
  stated that cemeteries were set apart by Government on behalf of
  the poorer classes.

  “In A.D. 1261, Hwang Chên, governor of the district of Wu, in a
  memorial praying that the erection of cremation furnaces might
  thenceforth be prohibited, dwelt upon the impropriety of burning
  the remains of the deceased, for whose obsequies a multitude of
  observances were prescribed by the religious rites. He further
  exposed the fallacy of the excuse alleged for the practice, to wit,
  that burning the dead was a fulfilment of the precepts of Buddha,
  and accused the priests of a certain monastery of converting into a
  source of illicit gain the practice of cremation.”

  [As an illustration of the cremation of a Buddhist priest, I note
  the following passage from an article published in the _North-China
  Herald_, 20th May, 1887, p. 556, on Kwei Hua Ch’eng, Mongolia:
  “Several Lamas are on visiting terms with me and they are very
  friendly. There are seven large and eight small Lamaseries, in care
  of from ten to two hundred Lamas. The principal Lamas at death
  are cremated. A short time ago, a friendly Lama took me to see a
  cremation. The furnace was roughly made of mud bricks, with four
  fire-holes at the base, with an opening in which to place the body.
  The whole was about 6 feet high, and about 5 feet in circumference.
  Greased fuel was arranged within and covered with glazed foreign
  calico, on which were written some Tibetan characters. A tent was
  erected and mats arranged for the Lamas. About 11.30 A.M. a scarlet
  covered bier appeared in sight carried by thirty-two beggars. A box
  2 feet square and 2½ feet high was taken out and placed near the
  furnace. The Lamas arrived and attired themselves in gorgeous robes
  and sat cross-legged. During the preparations to chant, some butter
  was being melted in a corner of the tent. A screen of calico was
  drawn round the furnace in which the cremator placed the body, and
  filled up the opening. Then a dozen Lamas began chanting the burial
  litany in Tibetan in deep bass voices. Then the head priest blessed
  the torches and when the fires were lit he blessed a fan to fan the
  flames, and lastly some melted butter, which was poured in at the
  top to make the whole blaze. This was frequently repeated. When
  fairly ablaze, a few pieces of Tibetan grass were thrown in at the
  top. After three days the whole cooled, and a priest with one gold
  and one silver chopstick collects the bones, which are placed in a
  bag for burial. If the bones are white it is a sign that his sin is
  purged, if black that perfection has not been attained.”—H. C.]

  And it is very worthy of note that the Chinese envoy to Chinla
  (Kamboja) in 1295, an individual who may have personally known
  Marco Polo, in speaking of the custom prevalent there of exposing
  the dead, adds: “There are some, however, who burn their dead.
  _These are all descendants of Chinese immigrants._”

  [Professor J. J. M. de Groot remarks that “being of religious
  origin, cremation is mostly denoted in China by clerical terms,
  expressive of the metamorphosis the funeral pyre is intended to
  effect, viz. ‘transformation of man’; ‘transformation of the body’;
  ‘metamorphosis by fire.’ Without the clerical sphere it bears no
  such high-sounding names, being simply called ‘incineration of
  corpses.’ A term of illogical composition, and nevertheless very
  common in the books, is ‘fire burial.’” It appears that during the
  Sung Dynasty cremation was especially common in the provinces of
  Shan-si, Cheh-kiang, and Kiang-su. During the Mongol Dynasty, the
  instances of cremation which are mentioned in Chinese books are,
  relatively speaking, numerous. Professor de Groot says also that
  “there exists evidence that during the Mongol domination cremation
  also throve in Fuhkien.” (_Religious System of China_, vol. iii.
  pp. 1391, 1409, 1410.)—H. C.]

                             CHAPTER LXI.

    CONCERNING THE CITY OF CHINANGLI, AND THAT OF TADINFU, AND THE
                          REBELLION OF LITAN.


Chinangli is a city of Cathay as you go south, and it belongs to the
Great Kaan; the people are Idolaters, and have paper-money. There runs
through the city a great and wide river, on which a large traffic in
silk goods and spices and other costly merchandize passes up and down.

When you travel south from Chinangli for five days, you meet everywhere
with fine towns and villages, the people of which are all Idolaters,
and burn their dead, and are subject to the Great Kaan, and have
paper-money, and live by trade and handicrafts, and have all the
necessaries of life in great abundance. But there is nothing particular
to mention on the way till you come, at the end of those five days, to
TADINFU.{1}

This, you must know, is a very great city, and in old times was the
seat of a great kingdom; but the Great Kaan conquered it by force
of arms. Nevertheless it is still the noblest city in all those
provinces. There are very great merchants here, who trade on a great
scale, and the abundance of silk is something marvellous. They have,
moreover, most charming gardens abounding with fruit of large size.
The city of Tadinfu hath also under its rule eleven imperial cities
of great importance, all of which enjoy a large and profitable trade,
owing to that immense produce of silk.{2}

Now, you must know, that in the year of Christ, 1273, the Great Kaan
had sent a certain Baron called LIYTAN SANGON,{3} with some 80,000
horse, to this province and city, to garrison them. And after the said
captain had tarried there a while, he formed a disloyal and traitorous
plot, and stirred up the great men of the province to rebel against the
Great Kaan. And so they did; for they broke into revolt against their
sovereign lord, and refused all obedience to him, and made this Liytan,
whom their sovereign had sent thither for their protection, to be the
chief of their revolt.

When the Great Kaan heard thereof he straightway despatched two of his
Barons, one of whom was called AGUIL and the other MONGOTAY;{4} giving
them 100,000 horse and a great force of infantry. But the affair was a
serious one, for the Barons were met by the rebel Liytan with all those
whom he had collected from the province, mustering more than 100,000
horse and a large force of foot. Nevertheless in the battle Liytan and
his party were utterly routed, and the two Barons whom the Emperor
had sent won the victory. When the news came to the Great Kaan he was
right well pleased, and ordered that all the chiefs who had rebelled,
or excited others to rebel, should be put to a cruel death, but that
those of lower rank should receive a pardon. And so it was done. The
two Barons had all the leaders of the enterprise put to a cruel death,
and all those of lower rank were pardoned. And thenceforward they
conducted themselves with loyalty towards their lord.{5}

Now having told you all about this affair, let us have done with it,
and I will tell you of another place that you come to in going south,
which is called SINJU-MATU.


  NOTE 1.—There seems to be no solution to the difficulties attaching
  to the account of these two cities (Chinangli and Tadinfu) except
  that the two have been confounded, either by a lapse of memory on
  the traveller’s part or by a misunderstanding on that of Rusticiano.

  The position and name of CHINANGLI point, as Pauthier has shown,
  to T’SI-NAN FU, the chief city of Shan-tung. The second city is
  called in the G. Text and Pauthier’s MSS. _Candinfu_, _Condinfu_,
  and _Cundinfu_, names which it has not been found possible to
  elucidate. But adopting the reading _Tadinfu_ of some of the old
  printed editions (supported by the _Tudinfu_ of Ramusio and the
  _Tandifu_ of the Riccardian MS.), Pauthier shows that the city now
  called _Yen-chau_ bore under the Kin the name of TAI-TING FU, which
  may fairly thus be recognised. [Under the Sung Dynasty Yen-chau was
  named T’ai-ning and Lung-k’ing. (_Playfair’s Dict._ p. 388.)—H. C.]

  It was not, however, Yen-chau, but _T’si-nan fu_, which was “the
  noblest city in all those provinces,” and had been “in old times
  the seat of a kingdom,” as well as recently the scene of the
  episode of Litan’s rebellion. T’si-nan fu lies in a direct line
  86 miles south of T’sang-chau (_Changlu_), near the banks of the
  Ta-t’sing ho, a large river which communicates with the great canal
  near T’si-ning chau, and which was, no doubt, of greater importance
  in Polo’s time than in the last six centuries. For up nearly to
  the origin of the Mongol power it appears to have been one of the
  main discharges of the Hwang-Ho. The recent changes in that river
  have again brought its main stream into the same channel, and the
  “New Yellow River” passes three or four miles to the north of the
  city. T’si-nan fu has frequently of late been visited by European
  travellers, who report it as still a place of importance, with much
  life and bustle, numerous book-shops, several fine temples, two
  mosques, and all the furniture of a provincial capital. It has also
  a Roman Catholic Cathedral of Gothic architecture. (_Williamson_,
  I. 102.)

  [Tsi-nan “is a populous and rich city; and by means of the river
  (Ta Tsing ho, Great Clear River) carries on an extensive commerce.
  The soil is fertile, and produces grain and fruits in abundance.
  Silk of an excellent quality is manufactured, and commands a high
  price. The lakes and rivers are well stored with fish.” (_Chin.
  Rep._ XI. p. 562.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—The Chinese Annals, more than 2000 years B.C., speak of
  silk as an article of tribute from Shan-tung; and evidently it
  was one of the provinces most noted in the Middle Ages for that
  article. Compare the quotation in note on next chapter from Friar
  Odoric. Yet the older modern accounts speak only of the _wild_
  silk of Shan-tung. Mr. Williamson, however, points out that there
  is an extensive produce from the genuine mulberry silkworm, and
  anticipates a very important trade in Shan-tung silk. Silk fabrics
  are also largely produced, and some of extraordinary quality.
  (_Williamson_, I. 112, 131.)

  The expressions of Padre Martini, in speaking of the wild silk of
  Shan-tung, strongly remind one of the talk of the ancients about
  the origin of silk, and suggest the possibility that this may not
  have been mere groundless fancy: “Non in globum aut ovum ductum,
  sed in longissimum filum paulatim ex ore emissum, albi coloris,
  quæ arbustis dumisque, adhærentia, atque a vento huc illucque
  agitata colliguntur,” etc. Compare this with Pliny’s “Seres lanitia
  silvarum nobiles, perfusam aqua depectentes frondium caniciem,” or
  Claudian’s “Stamine, quod molli tondent de stipite Seres, Frondea
  lanigeræ carpentes vellera silvæ; Et longum tenues tractus producit
  in aurum.”

  NOTE 3.—The title _Sangon_ is, as Pauthier points out, the Chinese
  _Tsiang-kiun_, a “general of division,” [or better “Military
  Governor”.—H. C.] John Bell calls an officer, bearing the
  same title, “Merin _Sanguin_.” I suspect _T’siang-kiun_ is the
  _Jang-Jang_ of Baber.

  NOTE 4.—AGUL was the name of a distant cousin of Kúblái, who was
  the father of Nayan (_supra_, ch. ii. and Genealogy of the House of
  Chinghiz in Appendix A). MANGKUTAI, under Kúblái, held the command

  NOTE 5.—LITAN, a Chinese of high military position and reputation
  under the Mongols, in the early part of Kúblái’s reign, commanded
  the troops in Shan-tung and the conquered parts of Kiang-nan.
  In the beginning of 1262 he carried out a design that he had
  entertained since Kúblái’s accession, declared for the Sung
  Emperor, to whom he gave up several important places, put
  detached Mongol garrisons to the sword, and fortified T’si-nan
  and T’sing-chau. Kúblái despatched Prince Apiché and the General
  Ssetienché against him. Litan, after some partial success, was
  beaten and driven into T’si-nan, which the Mongols immediately
  invested. After a blockade of four months, the garrison was reduced
  to extremities. Litan, in despair, put his women to death and threw
  himself into a lake adjoining the city; but he was taken out alive
  and executed. T’sing-chau then surrendered. (_Gaubil_, 139–140; _De

                             CHAPTER LXII.

                CONCERNING THE NOBLE CITY OF SINJUMATU.


On leaving Tadinfu you travel three days towards the south, always
finding numbers of noble and populous towns and villages flourishing
with trade and manufactures. There is also abundance of game in the
country, and everything in profusion.

When you have travelled those three days you come to the noble city of
SINJUMATU, a rich and fine place, with great trade and manufactures.
The people are Idolaters and subjects of the Great Kaan, and have
paper-money, and they have a river which I can assure you brings them
great gain, and I will tell you about it.

You see the river in question flows from the South to this city of
Sinjumatu. And the people of the city have divided this larger river
in two, making one half of it flow east and the other half flow west;
that is to say, the one branch flows towards Manzi and the other
towards Cathay. And it is a fact that the number of vessels at this
city is what no one would believe without seeing them. The quantity
of merchandize also which these vessels transport to Manzi and Cathay
is something marvellous; and then they return loaded with other
merchandize, so that the amount of goods borne to and fro on those two
rivers is quite astonishing.{1}


  NOTE 1.—Friar Odoric, proceeding by water northward to Cambaluc
  about 1324–1325, says: “As I travelled by that river towards the
  east, and passed many towns and cities, I came to a certain city
  which is called SUNZUMATU, which hath a greater plenty of silk than
  perhaps any place on earth, for when silk is at the dearest you
  can still have 40 lbs. for less than eight groats. There is in the
  place likewise great store of merchandise,” etc. When commenting
  on Odoric, I was inclined to identify this city with Lin-t’sing
  chau, but its position with respect to the two last cities in
  Polo’s itinerary renders this inadmissible; and Murray and Pauthier
  seem to be right in identifying it with T’SI-NING CHAU. The affix
  _Matu_ (_Ma-t’eu_, a jetty, a place of river trade) might easily
  attach itself to the name of such a great depôt of commerce on the
  canal as Marco here describes, though no Chinese authority has
  been produced for its being so styled. The only objection to the
  identification with T’si-ning chau is the difficulty of making 3
  days’ journey of the short distance between Yen-chau and that city.

  Polo, according to the route supposed, comes first upon the
  artificial part of the Great Canal here. The rivers _Wen_ and
  _Sse_ (from near Yen-chau) flowing from the side of Shan-tung, and
  striking the canal line at right angles near T’si-ning chau, have
  been thence diverted north-west and south-east, so as to form the
  canal; the point of their original confluence at Nan-wang forming,
  apparently, the summit level of the canal. There is a little
  confusion in Polo’s account, owing to his describing the river as
  coming from the _south_, which, according to his orientation, would
  be the side towards Honan. In this respect his words would apply
  more accurately to the _Wei_ River at Lin-t’sing (see _Biot_ in _J.
  As._ sér. III. tom. xiv. 194, and _J. N. C. B. R. A. S._, 1866, p.
  11; also the map with ch. lxiv.) [Father Gandar (_Canal Impérial_,
  p. 22, note) says that the remark of Marco Polo: “The river flows
  from the south to this city of Sinjumatu,” cannot be applied to
  the _Wen-ho_ nor to the _Sse-ho_, which are rivers of little
  importance and running from the east, whilst the _Wei-ho_, coming
  from the south-east, waters Lin-ts’ing, and answers well to our
  traveller’s text.—H. C.] Duhalde calls T’si-ning chau “one of the
  most considerable cities of the empire”; and Nieuhoff speaks of its
  large trade and population. [Sir John F. Davis writes that Tsi-ning
  chau is a town of considerable dimensions.... “The _ma-tow_, or
  platforms, before the principal boats had ornamental gateways over
  them.... The canal seems to render this an opulent and flourishing
  place, to judge by the gilded and carved shops, temples, and public
  offices, along the eastern banks.” (_Sketches of China_, I. pp.
  255–257.)—H. C.]




                            CHAPTER LXIII.

               CONCERNING THE CITIES OF LINJU AND PIJU.


On leaving the city of Sinju-matu you travel for eight days towards the
south, always coming to great and rich towns and villages flourishing
with trade and manufactures. The people are all subjects of the Great
Kaan, use paper-money, and burn their dead. At the end of those eight
days you come to the city of LINJU, in the province of the same name of
which it is the capital. It is a rich and noble city, and the men are
good soldiers, natheless they carry on great trade and manufactures.
There is great abundance of game in both beasts and birds, and all the
necessaries of life are in profusion. The place stands on the river of
which I told you above. And they have here great numbers of vessels,
even greater than those of which I spoke before, and these transport a
great amount of costly merchandize{1}.

So, quitting this province and city of Linju, you travel three days
more towards the south, constantly finding numbers of rich towns
and villages. These still belong to Cathay; and the people are all
Idolaters, burning their dead, and using paper-money, that I mean of
their Lord the Great Kaan, whose subjects they are. This is the finest
country for game, whether in beasts or birds, that is anywhere to be
found, and all the necessaries of life are in profusion.

At the end of those three days you find the city of PIJU, a great,
rich, and noble city, with large trade and manufactures, and a great
production of silk. This city stands at the entrance to the great
province of Manzi, and there reside at it a great number of merchants
who despatch carts from this place loaded with great quantities of
goods to the different towns of Manzi. The city brings in a great
revenue to the Great Kaan.{2}


  NOTE 1.—Murray suggests that Lingiu is a place which appears in
  D’Anville’s Map of Shan-tung as _Lintching-y_, and in Arrowsmith’s
  Map of China (also in those of Berghaus and Keith Johnston) as
  _Lingchinghien_. The position assigned to it, however, on the west
  bank of the canal, nearly under the 35th degree of latitude, would
  agree fairly with Polo’s data. [_Lin-ch’ing, Lin-tsing_, lat. 37°
  03′, _Playfair’s Dict._ No. 4276; _Biot_, p. 107.—H. C.]

  In any case, I imagine Lingiu (of which, perhaps, _Lingin_ may
  be the correct reading) to be the _Lenzin_ of Odoric, which he
  reached in travelling by water from the south, before arriving at
  Sinjumatu. (_Cathay_, p. 125.)

  NOTE 2.—There can be no doubt that this is PEI-CHAU on the east
  bank of the canal. The abundance of game about here is noticed by
  Nieuhoff (in _Astley_, III. 417). [See _D. Gandar, Canal Impérial_,
  1894.—H. C.]




                             CHAPTER LXIV.

      CONCERNING THE CITY OF SIJU, AND THE GREAT RIVER CARAMORAN.


When you leave Piju you travel towards the south for two days, through
beautiful districts abounding in everything, and in which you find
quantities of all kinds of game. At the end of those two days you reach
the city of SIJU, a great, rich, and noble city, flourishing with
trade and manufactures. The people are Idolaters, burn their dead, use
paper-money, and are subjects of the Great Kaan. They possess extensive
and fertile plains producing abundance of wheat and other grain.{1} But
there is nothing else to mention, so let us proceed and tell you of the
countries further on.

On leaving Siju you ride south for three days, constantly falling
in with fine towns and villages and hamlets and farms, with their
cultivated lands. There is plenty of wheat and other corn, and of game
also; and the people are all Idolaters and subjects of the Great Kaan.

At the end of those three days you reach the great river CARAMORAN,
which flows hither from Prester John’s country. It is a great river,
and more than a mile in width, and so deep that great ships can
navigate it. It abounds in fish, and very big ones too. You must know
that in this river there are some 15,000 vessels, all belonging to
the Great Kaan, and kept to transport his troops to the Indian Isles
whenever there may be occasion; for the sea is only one day distant
from the place we are speaking of. And each of these vessels, taking
one with another, will require 20 mariners, and will carry 15 horses
with the men belonging to them, and their provisions, arms, and
equipments.{2}

Hither and thither, on either bank of the river, stands a town; the one
facing the other. The one is called COIGANJU and the other CAIJU; the
former is a large place, and the latter a little one. And when you pass
this river you enter the great province of MANZI. So now I must tell
you how this province of Manzi was conquered by the Great Kaan.{3}


  NOTE 1.—SIJU can scarcely be other than Su-t’sien (_Sootsin_ of
  Keith Johnston’s map) as Murray and Pauthier have said. The latter
  states that one of the old names of the place was _Si-chau_, which
  corresponds to that given by Marco. Biot does not give this name.

  The town stands on the flat alluvial of the Hwang-Ho, and is
  approached by high embanked roads. (_Astley_, III. 524–525.)

  [Sir J. F. Davis writes: “From _Sootsien Hien_ to the point of
  junction with the Yellow River, a length of about fifty miles, that
  great stream and the canal run nearly parallel with each other,
  at an average distance of four or five miles, and sometimes much
  nearer.” (_Sketches of China_, I. p. 265.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—We have again arrived on the banks of the Hwang-Ho, which
  was crossed higher up on our traveller’s route to Karájang.

  No accounts, since China became known to modern Europe, attribute
  to the Hwang-Ho the great utility for navigation which Polo here
  and elsewhere ascribes to it. Indeed, we are told that its current
  is so rapid that its navigation is scarcely practicable, and the
  only traffic of the kind that we hear of is a transport of coal
  in Shan-si for a certain distance down stream. This rapidity
  also, bringing down vast quantities of soil, has so raised the
  bed that in recent times the tide has not entered the river, as
  it probably did in our traveller’s time, when, as it would appear
  from his account, seagoing craft used to ascend to the ferry north
  of Hwai-ngan fu, or thereabouts. Another indication of change is
  his statement that the passage just mentioned was only one day’s
  journey from the sea, whereas it is now about 50 miles in a direct
  line. But the river has of late years undergone changes much more
  material.

  [Illustration: Sketch Map, exhibiting the VARIATIONS of the TWO
    GREAT RIVERS OF CHINA Within the Period of History.]

  In the remotest times of which the Chinese have any record, the
  Hwang-Ho discharged its waters into the Gulf of Chih-li, by two
  branches, the most northerly of which appears to have followed
  the present course of the Pei-ho below Tien-tsing. In the time of
  the Shang Dynasty (ending B.C. 1078) a branch more southerly than
  either of the above flowed towards T’si-ning, and combined with the
  _T’si_ River, which flowed by T’si-nan fu, the same in fact that
  was till recently called the Ta-t’sing. In the time of Confucius
  we first hear of a branch being thrown off south-east towards the
  Hwai, flowing north of Hwai-ngan, in fact towards the embouchure
  which our maps still display as that of the Hwang-Ho. But, about
  the 3rd and 4th centuries of our era, the river discharged
  exclusively by the T’si; and up to the Mongol age, or nearly so,
  the mass of the waters of this great river continued to flow into
  the Gulf of Chih-li. They then changed their course bodily towards
  the Hwai, and followed that general direction to the sea; this they
  had adopted before the time of our traveller, and they retained
  it till a very recent period. The mass of Shan-tung thus forms a
  mountainous island rising out of the vast alluvium of the Hwang-Ho,
  whose discharge into the sea has alternated between the north and
  the south of that mountainous tract. (_See Map opposite_.)

  During the reign of the last Mongol emperor, a project was adopted
  for restoring the Hwang-Ho to its former channel, discharging into
  the Gulf of Chih-li; and discontents connected with this scheme
  promoted the movement for the expulsion of the dynasty (1368).

  A river whose regimen was liable to such vast changes was
  necessarily a constant source of danger, insomuch that the Emperor
  Kia-K’ing in his will speaks of it as having been “from the
  remotest ages China’s sorrow.” Some idea of the enormous works
  maintained for the control of the river may be obtained from the
  following description of their character on the north bank, some
  distance to the west of Kai-fung fu:

  “In a village, apparently bounded by an earthen wall as large as
  that of the Tartar city of Peking, was reached the first of the
  outworks erected to resist the Hwang-Ho, and on arriving at the top
  that river and the gigantic earthworks rendered necessary by its
  outbreaks burst on the view. On a level with the spot on which I
  was standing stretched a series of embankments, each one about 70
  feet high, and of breadth sufficient for four railway trucks to run
  abreast on them. The mode of their arrangement was on this wise:
  one long bank ran parallel to the direction of the stream; half a
  mile distant from it ran a similar one; these two embankments were
  then connected by another series exactly similar in size, height,
  and breadth, and running at right angles to them right down to the
  edge of the water.”

  In 1851, the Hwang-Ho burst its northern embankment nearly 30 miles
  east of Kai-fung fu; the floods of the two following years enlarged
  the breach; and in 1853 the river, after six centuries, resumed
  the ancient direction of its discharge into the Gulf of Chih-li.
  Soon after leaving its late channel, it at present spreads,
  without defined banks, over the very low lands of South-Western
  Shan-tung, till it reaches the Great Canal, and then enters the
  Ta-t’sing channel, passing north of T’si-nan to the sea. The old
  channel crossed by Polo in the present journey is quite deserted.
  The greater part of the bed is there cultivated; it is dotted with
  numerous villages; and the vast trading town of Tsing-kiang pu
  was in 1868 extending so rapidly from the southern bank that a
  traveller in that year says he expected that in two years it would
  reach the northern bank.

  The same change has destroyed the Grand Canal as a navigable
  channel for many miles south of Lin-t’sing chau. (_J. R. G. S._
  XXVIII. 294–295; _Escayrac de Lauture, Mém. sur la Chine; Cathay_,
  p. 125; _Reports of Journeys in China_, etc. [by Consuls Alabaster,
  Oxenham, etc., Parl. Blue Book], 1869, pp. 4–5, 14; _Mr. Elias_ in
  _J. R. G. S._ XL. p. 1 _seqq._)

  [Since the exploration of the Hwang-Ho in 1868 by Mr. Ney Elias and
  by Mr. H. G. Hollingworth, an inspection of this river was made in
  1889 and a report published in 1891 by the Dutch Engineers J. G. W.
  Fijnje van Salverda, Captain P. G. van Schermbeek and A. Visser,
  for the improvement of the Yellow River.—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—Coiganju will be noticed below. _Caiju_ does not seem to be
  traceable, having probably been carried away by the changes in the
  river. But it would seem to have been at the mouth of the canal on
  the north side of the Hwang-Ho, and the name is the same as that
  given below (ch. lxxii.) to the town (_Kwachau_) occupying the
  corresponding position on the Kiang.

  “Khatai,” says Rashiduddin, “is bounded on one side by the country
  of Máchín, which the Chinese call MANZI.... In the Indian language
  Southern China is called Mahá-chín, _i.e._ ‘Great China,’ and
  hence we derive the word _Machin_. The Mongols call the same
  country _Nangiass_. It is separated from Khatai by the river called
  KARAMORAN, which comes from the mountains of Tibet and Kashmir, and
  which is never fordable. The capital of this kingdom is the city of
  _Khingsai_, which is forty days’ journey from Khanbalik.” (_Quat.
  Rashid._, xci.–xciii.)

  MANZI (or Mangi) is a name used for Southern China, or more
  properly for the territory which constituted the dominion of the
  Sung Dynasty at the time when the Mongols conquered Cathay or
  Northern China from the Kin, not only by Marco, but by Odoric and
  John Marignolli, as well as by the Persian writers, who, however,
  more commonly call it _Máchín_. I imagine that some confusion
  between the two words led to the appropriation of the latter name,
  also to _Southern_ China. The term _Man-tzŭ_ or _Man-tze_ signifies
  “Barbarians” (“Sons of Barbarians”), and was applied, it is said,
  by the Northern Chinese to their neighbours on the south, whose
  civilisation was of later date.[1] The name is now specifically
  applied to a wild race on the banks of the Upper Kiang. But it
  retains its mediæval application in Manchuria, where _Mantszi_ is
  the name given to the Chinese immigrants, and in that use is said
  to date from the time of Kúblái. (_Palladius_ in _J. R. G. S._ vol.
  xlii. p. 154.) And Mr. Moule has found the word, apparently used in
  Marco’s exact sense, in a Chinese extract of the period, contained
  in the topography of the famous Lake of Hang-chau (_infra_, ch.
  lxxvi.–lxxvii.)

  Though both Polo and Rashiduddin call the Karamoran the boundary
  between Cathay and Manzi, it was not so for any great distance.
  Ho-nan belonged essentially to Cathay.

                             CHAPTER LXV.

          HOW THE GREAT KAAN CONQUERED THE PROVINCE OF MANZI.


You must know that there was a King and Sovereign lord of the great
territory of Manzi who was styled FACFUR, so great and puissant a
prince, that for vastness of wealth and number of subjects and extent
of dominion, there was hardly a greater in all the earth except the
Great Kaan himself.{1} But the people of his land were anything rather
than warriors; all their delight was in women, and nought but women;
and so it was above all with the King himself, for he took thought of
nothing else but women, unless it were of charity to the poor.

In all his dominion there were no horses; nor were the people ever
inured to battle or arms, or military service of any kind. Yet the
province of Manzi is very strong by nature, and all the cities are
encompassed by sheets of water of great depth, and more than an
arblast-shot in width; so that the country never would have been lost,
had the people but been soldiers. But that is just what they were not;
so lost it was.{2}

Now it came to pass, in the year of Christ’s incarnation, 1268, that
the Great Kaan, the same that now reigneth, despatched thither a Baron
of his whose name was BAYAN CHINCSAN, which is as much as to say “Bayan
Hundred Eyes.” And you must know that the King of Manzi had found in
his horoscope that he never should lose his Kingdom except through
a man that had an hundred eyes; so he held himself assured in his
position, for he could not believe that any man in existence could have
an hundred eyes. There, however, he deluded himself, in his ignorance
of the name of Bayan.{3}

This Bayan had an immense force of horse and foot entrusted to him by
the Great Kaan, and with these he entered Manzi, and he had also a
great number of boats to carry both horse and food when need should
be. And when he, with all his host, entered the territory of Manzi and
arrived at this city of COIGANJU—whither we now are got, and of which
we shall speak presently—he summoned the people thereof to surrender
to the Great Kaan; but this they flatly refused. On this Bayan went on
to another city, with the same result, and then still went forward;
acting thus because he was aware that the Great Kaan was despatching
another great host to follow him up.{4}

What shall I say then? He advanced to five cities in succession, but
got possession of none of them; for he did not wish to engage in
besieging them and they would not give themselves up. But when he came
to the sixth city he took that by storm, and so with a second, and a
third, and a fourth, until he had taken twelve cities in succession.
And when he had taken all these he advanced straight against the
capital city of the kingdom, which was called KINSAY, and which was the
residence of the King and Queen.

And when the King beheld Bayan coming with all his host, he was in
great dismay, as one unused to see such sights. So he and a great
company of his people got on board a thousand ships and fled to the
islands of the Ocean Sea, whilst the Queen who remained behind in the
city took all measures in her power for its defence, like a valiant
lady.

Now it came to pass that the Queen asked what was the name of the
captain of the host, and they told her that it was Bayan Hundred-Eyes.
So when she wist that he was styled Hundred-Eyes, she called to mind
how their astrologers had foretold that a man of an hundred eyes should
strip them of the kingdom.{5} Wherefore she gave herself up to Bayan,
and surrendered to him the whole kingdom and all the other cities and
fortresses, so that no resistance was made. And in sooth this was a
goodly conquest, for there was no realm on earth half so wealthy.{6}
The amount that the King used to expend was perfectly marvellous; and
as an example I will tell you somewhat of his liberal acts.

In those provinces they are wont to expose their new-born babes; I
speak of the poor, who have not the means of bringing them up. But
the King used to have all those foundlings taken charge of, and had
note made of the signs and planets under which each was born, and then
put them out to nurse about the country. And when any rich man was
childless he would go to the King and obtain from him as many of these
children as he desired. Or, when the children grew up, the King would
make up marriages among them, and provide for the couples from his own
purse. In this manner he used to provide for some 20,000 boys and girls
every year.{7}

I will tell you another thing this King used to do. If he was taking a
ride through the city and chanced to see a house that was very small
and poor standing among other houses that were fine and large, he
would ask why it was so, and they would tell him it belonged to a poor
man who had not the means to enlarge it. Then the King would himself
supply the means. And thus it came to pass that in all the capital of
the kingdom of Manzi, Kinsay by name, you should not see any but fine
houses.

This King used to be waited on by more than a thousand young gentlemen
and ladies, all clothed in the richest fashion. And he ruled his realm
with such justice that no malefactors were to be found therein. The
city in fact was so secure that no man closed his doors at night,
not even in houses and shops that were full of all sorts of rich
merchandize. No one could do justice in the telling to the great riches
of that country, and to the good disposition of the people. Now that I
have told you about the kingdom, I will go back to the Queen.

You must know that she was conducted to the Great Kaan, who gave her
an honourable reception, and caused her to be served with all state,
like a great lady as she was. But as for the King her husband, he never
more did quit the isles of the sea to which he had fled, but died
there. So leave we him and his wife and all their concerns, and let us
return to our story, and go on regularly with our account of the great
province of Manzi and of the manners and customs of its people. And, to
begin at the beginning, we must go back to the city of Coiganju, from
which we digressed to tell you about the conquest of Manzi.


  NOTE 1.—_Faghfúr_ or _Baghbúr_ was a title applied by old Persian
  and Arabic writers to the Emperor of China, much in the way that we
  used to speak of the _Great Mogul_, and our fathers of the _Sophy_.
  It is, as Neumann points out, an old Persian translation of the
  Chinese title _Tien-tzŭ_, “Son of Heaven”; _Bagh-Púr_ = “The Son
  of the Divinity,” as Sapor or _Sháh-Púr_ = “The Son of the King.”
  _Faghfur_ seems to have been used as a proper name in Turkestan.
  (See _Baber_, 423.)

  There is a word, _Takfúr_, applied similarly by the Mahomedans to
  the Greek emperors of both Byzantium and Trebizond (and also to the
  Kings of Cilician Armenia), which was perhaps adopted as a jingling
  match to the former term; Faghfur, the great infidel king in the
  East; Takfur, the great infidel king in the West. Defrémery says
  this is Armenian, _Tagavor_, “a king.” (_I. B._, II. 393, 427.)

  [“The last of the Sung Emperors (1276) ‘Facfur’ (_i.e._ the Arabic
  for _Tien Tzŭ_) was freed by Kúblái from the (ancient Kotan)
  indignity of surrendering with a rope round his neck, leading a
  sheep, and he received the title of Duke. In 1288 he went to Tibet
  to study Buddhism, and in 1296 he and his mother, Ts’iuen T’aï How,
  became a bonze and a nun, and were allowed to hold 360 _k’ing_ (say
  5000 acres) of land free of taxes under the then existing laws.”
  (_E. H. Parker, China Review_, February, March 1901, p. 195.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—Nevertheless the history of the conquest shows instances
  of extraordinary courage and self-devotion on the part of Chinese
  officers, especially in the defence of fortresses—virtues often
  shown in like degree, under like circumstances, by the same class,
  in the modern history of China.

  NOTE 3.—Bayan (signifying “great” or “noble”) is a name of very
  old renown among the Nomad nations, for we find it as that of the
  Khagan of the Avars in the 6th century. The present BAYAN, Kúblái’s
  most famous lieutenant, was of princely birth, in the Mongol
  tribe called Barin. In his youth he served in the West of Asia
  under Hulaku. According to Rashiduddin, about 1265 he was sent to
  Cathay with certain ambassadors of the Kaan’s who were returning
  thither. He was received with great distinction by Kúblái, who was
  greatly taken with his prepossessing appearance and ability, and a
  command was assigned him. In 1273, after the capture of Siang-Yang
  (_infra_, ch. lxx.) the Kaan named him to the chief command in the
  prosecution of the war against the Sung Dynasty. Whilst Bayan was
  in the full tide of success, Kúblái, alarmed by the ravages of
  Kaidu on the Mongolian frontier, recalled him to take the command
  there, but, on the general’s remonstrance, he gave way, and made
  him a minister of state (CHINGSIANG). The essential part of his
  task was completed by the surrender of the capital _King-szé_
  (Lin-ngan, now Hang-chau) to his arms in the beginning of 1276. He
  was then recalled to court, and immediately despatched to Mongolia,
  where he continued in command for seventeen years, his great
  business being to keep down the restless Kaidu. [“The biography of
  this valiant captain is found in the _Yuen-shi_ (ch. cxxvii.). It
  is quite in accordance with the biographical notices Rashid gives
  of the same personage. He calls him _Bayan_.” (_Bretschneider, Med.
  Res._ I. p. 271, note).]

  [“The inventory, records, etc., of Kinsai, mentioned by Marco Polo,
  as also the letter from the old empress, are undoubted facts:
  complete stock was taken, and 5,692,656 souls were added to the
  population (in the two Chêh alone). The Emperor surrendered in
  person to Bayan a few days after his official surrender, which
  took place on the 18th day of the 1st moon in 1276. Bayan took the
  Emperor to see Kúblái.” (_E. H. Parker, China Review_, XXIV. p.
  105.)—H. C.]

  In 1293, enemies tried to poison the emperor’s ear against Bayan,
  and they seemed to have succeeded; for Kúblái despatched his heir,
  the Prince Teimur, to supersede him in the frontier command.
  Bayan beat Kaidu once more, and then made over his command with
  characteristic dignity. On his arrival at court, Kúblái received
  him with the greatest honour, and named him chief minister of state
  and commandant of his guards and the troops about Cambaluc. The
  emperor died in the beginning of the next year (1294), and Bayan’s
  high position enabled him to take decisive measures for preserving
  order, and maintaining Kúblái’s disposition of the succession.
  Bayan was raised to still higher dignities, but died at the age of
  59, within less than a year of the master whom he had served so
  well for 30 years (about January, 1295). After his death, according
  to the peculiar Chinese fashion, he received yet further accessions
  of dignity.

  The language of Chinese historians in speaking of this great man
  is thus rendered by De Mailla; it is a noble eulogy of a Tartar
  warrior:—

  “He was endowed with a lofty genius, and possessed in the highest
  measure the art of handling great bodies of troops. When he marched
  against the Sung, he directed the movements of 200,000 men with
  as much ease and coolness as if there had been but one man under
  his orders. All his officers looked up to him as a prodigy; and
  having absolute trust in his capacity, they obeyed him with entire
  submission. Nobody knew better how to deal with soldiers, or to
  moderate their ardour when it carried them too far. He was never
  seen sad except when forced to shed blood, for he was sparing even
  of the blood of his enemy.... His modesty was not inferior to his
  ability.... He would attribute all the honour to the conduct of
  his officers, and he was ever ready to extol their smallest feats.
  He merited the praises of Chinese as well as Mongols, and both
  nations long regretted the loss of this great man.” De Mailla gives
  a different account from Rashiduddin and Gaubil, of the manner in
  which Bayan first entered the Kaan’s service. (_Gaubil_, 145, 159,
  169, 179, 183, 221, 223–224; _Erdmann_, 222–223; _De Mailla_, IX.
  335, 458, 461–463.)

  NOTE 4.—As regards Bayan personally, and the main body under his
  command, this seems to be incorrect. His advance took place from
  Siang-yang along the lines of the Han River and of the Great Kiang.
  Another force indeed marched direct upon Yang-chau, and therefore
  probably by Hwai-ngan chau (_infra_, p. 152); and it is noted
  that Bayan’s orders to the generals of this force were to spare
  bloodshed. (_Gaubil_, 159; _D’Ohsson_, II. 398.)

  NOTE 5.—So in our own age ran the Hindu prophecy that Bhartpúr
  should never fall till there came a great alligator against it; and
  when it fell to the English assault, the Brahmans found that the
  name of the leader was COMBERMERE = _Kumhír-Mír_, the Crocodile
  Lord!

      ——“Be those juggling fiends no more believed
      That palter with us in a double sense;
      That keep the word of promise to our ear
      And break it to our hope!”

  It would seem from the expression, both in Pauthier’s text and in
  the G. T., as if Polo intended to say that _Chincsan_ (Cinqsan)
  meant “One Hundred Eyes”; and if so we could have no stronger proof
  of his ignorance of Chinese. It is _Pe-yen_, the Chinese form of
  _Bayan_, that means, or rather may be punningly rendered, “One
  Hundred Eyes.” Chincsan, _i.e._ _Ching-siang_, was the title of the
  superior ministers of state at Khanbaligh, as we have already seen.
  The title occurs pretty frequently in the Persian histories of the
  Mongols, and frequently as a Mongol title in Sanang Setzen. We find
  it also disguised as _Chyansam_ in a letter from certain Christian
  nobles at Khanbaligh, which Wadding quotes from the Papal archives.
  (See _Cathay_, pp. 314–315.)

  But it is right to observe that in the Ramusian version the
  mistranslation which we have noticed is not so undubitable:
  “Volendo sapere come avea nome il Capitano nemico, le fu detto,
  _Chinsambaian_, cioè _Cent’occhi_.”

  A kind of corroboration of Marco’s story, but giving a different
  form to the pun, has been found by Mr. W. F. Mayers, of the
  Diplomatic Department in China, in a Chinese compilation dating
  from the latter part of the 14th century. Under the heading, “_A
  Kiang-nan Prophecy_,” this book states that prior to the fall of
  the Sung a prediction ran through Kiang-nan: “If Kiang-nan fall, a
  hundred wild geese (_Pê-yen_) will make their appearance.” This,
  it is added, was not understood till the generalissimo _Peyen
  Chingsiang_ made his appearance on the scene. “Punning prophecies
  of this kind are so common in Chinese history, that the above is
  only worth noticing in connection with Marco Polo’s story.” (_N.
  and Q., China and Japan_, vol. ii. p. 162.)

  But I should suppose that the Persian historian Wassáf had also
  heard a bungled version of the same story, which he tells in a
  pointless manner of the fortress of _Sináfúr_ (evidently a clerical
  error for _Saianfu_, see below, ch. lxx.): “Payan ordered this
  fortress to be assaulted. The garrison had heard how the capital
  of China had fallen, and the army of Payan was drawing near. The
  commandant was an experienced veteran who had tasted all the
  sweets and bitters of fortune, and had borne the day’s heat and
  the night’s cold; he had, as the saw goes, milked the world’s cow
  dry. So he sent word to Payan: ‘In my youth’ (here we abridge
  Wassáf’s rigmarole) ‘I heard my father tell that this fortress
  should be taken by a man called _Payan_, and that all fencing and
  trenching, fighting and smiting, would be of no avail. You need
  not, therefore, bring an army hither; we give in; we surrender the
  fortress and all that is therein.’ So they opened the gates and
  came down.” (_Wassáf_, Hammer’s ed., p. 41).

  NOTE 6.—There continues in this narrative, with a general truth
  as to the course of events, a greater amount of error as to
  particulars than we should have expected. The Sung Emperor Tu
  Tsong, a debauched and effeminate prince, to whom Polo seems to
  refer, had died in 1274, leaving young children only. Chaohien, the
  second son, a boy of four years of age, was put on the throne, with
  his grandmother Siechi, as regent. The approach of Bayan caused
  the greatest alarm; the Sung Court made humble propositions, but
  they were not listened to. The brothers of the young emperor were
  sent off by sea into the southern provinces; the empress regent
  was also pressed to make her escape with the young emperor, but,
  after consenting, she changed her mind and would not move. The
  Mongols arrived before King-szé, and the empress sent the great
  seal of the empire to Bayan. He entered the city without resistance
  in the third month (say April), 1276, riding at the head of his
  whole staff with the standard of the general-in-chief before him.
  It is remarked that he went to look at the tide in the River
  Tsien Tang, which is noted for its bore. He declined to meet the
  regent and her grandson, pleading that he was ignorant of the
  etiquettes proper to such an interview. Before his entrance Bayan
  had nominated a joint-commission of Mongol and Chinese officers
  to the government of the city, and appointed a committee to take
  charge of all the public documents, maps, drawings, records of
  courts, and seals of all public offices, and to plant sentinels
  at necessary points. The emperor, his mother, and the rest of
  the Sung princes and princesses, were despatched to the Mongol
  capital. A desperate attempt was made, at Kwa-chau (_infra_, ch.
  lxxii.) to recapture the young emperor, but it failed. On their
  arrival at Ta-tu, Kúblái’s chief queen, Jamui Khatun, treated them
  with delicate consideration. This amiable lady, on being shown
  the spoils that came from Lin-ngan, only wept, and said to her
  husband, “So also shall it be with the Mongol empire one day!”
  The eldest of the two boys who had escaped was proclaimed emperor
  by his adherents at Fu-chau, in Fo-kien, but they were speedily
  driven from that province (where the local histories, as Mr. G.
  Phillips informs me, preserve traces of their adventures in the
  Islands of Amoy Harbour), and the young emperor died on a desert
  island off the Canton coast in 1278. His younger brother took his
  place, but a battle, in the beginning of 1279 finally extinguished
  these efforts of the expiring dynasty, and the minister jumped
  with his young lord into the sea. It is curious that Rashiduddin,
  with all his opportunities of knowledge, writing at least twenty
  years later, was not aware of this, for he speaks of the Prince of
  Manzi as still a fugitive in the forests between Zayton and Canton.
  (_Gaubil; D’Ohsson; De Mailla; Cathay_, p. 272.) [See _Parker_,
  _supra_, p. 148 and 149.—H. C.]

  There is a curious account in the _Lettres Édifiantes_ (xxiv. 45
  _seqq._) by P. Parrenin of a kind of _Pariah_ caste at Shao-hing
  (see ch. lxxix. note 1), who were popularly believed to be the
  descendants of the great lords of the Sung Court, condemned to that
  degraded condition for obstinately resisting the Mongols. Another
  notice, however, makes the degraded body rebels against the Sung.
  (_Milne_, p. 218.)

  NOTE 7.—There is much about the exposure of children, and about
  Chinese foundling hospitals, in the _Lettres Édifiantes_,
  especially in Recueil xv. 83, _seqq._ It is there stated that
  frequently a person not in circumstances to _pay_ for a wife for
  his son, would visit the foundling hospital to seek one. The
  childless rich also would sometimes get children there to pass
  off as their own; _adopted_ children being excluded from certain
  valuable privileges.

  Mr. Milne (_Life in China_), and again Mr. Medhurst (_Foreigner
  in Far Cathay_), have discredited the great prevalence of infant
  exposure in China; but since the last work was published, I have
  seen the translation of a recent strong remonstrance against the
  practice by a Chinese writer, which certainly implied that it was
  _very_ prevalent in the writer’s own province. Unfortunately, I
  have lost the reference. [See _Father G. Palatre, L’Infanticide et
  l’Œuvre de la Ste. Enfance en Chine_, 1878.—H. C.]




                             CHAPTER LXVI.

                   CONCERNING THE CITY OF COIGANJU.


Coiganju is, as I have told you already, a very large city standing
at the entrance to Manzi. The people are Idolaters and burn their
dead, and are subject to the Great Kaan. They have a vast amount of
shipping, as I mentioned before in speaking of the River Caramoran.
And an immense quantity of merchandize comes hither, for the city
is the seat of government for this part of the country. Owing to its
being on the river, many cities send their produce thither to be again
thence distributed in every direction. A great amount of salt also is
made here, furnishing some forty other cities with that article, and
bringing in a large revenue to the Great Kaan.{1}


  NOTE 1.—Coiganju is HWAI-NGAN CHAU, now _-Fu_, on the canal, some
  miles south of the channel of the Hwang-Ho; but apparently in
  Polo’s time the great river passed close to it. Indeed, the city
  takes its name from the River _Hwai_, into which the Hwang-Ho sent
  a branch when first seeking a discharge south of Shantung. The city
  extends for about 3 miles along the canal and much below its level.
  [According to Sir J. F. Davis, the situation of Hwai-ngan “is in
  every respect remarkable. A part of the town was so much below the
  level of the canal, that only the tops of the walls (at least 25
  feet high) could be seen from our boats.... It proved to be, next
  to Tien-tsin, by far the largest and most populous place we had yet
  seen, the capital itself excepted.” (_Sketches of China_, I. pp.
  277–278.)—H. C.]

  The headquarters of the salt manufacture of Hwai-ngan is a place
  called Yen-ching (“Salt-Town”), some distance to the S. of the
  former city (_Pauthier_).




                            CHAPTER LXVII.

                   OF THE CITIES OF PAUKIN AND CAYU.


When you leave Coiganju you ride south-east for a day along a causeway
laid with fine stone, which you find at this entrance to Manzi. On
either hand there is a great expanse of water, so that you cannot
enter the province except along this causeway. At the end of the day’s
journey you reach the fine city of PAUKIN. The people are Idolaters,
burn their dead, are subject to the Great Kaan, and use paper-money.
They live by trade and manufactures and have great abundance of silk,
whereof they weave a great variety of fine stuffs of silk and gold. Of
all the necessaries of life there is great store.

When you leave Paukin you ride another day to the south-east, and then
you arrive at the city of CAYU. The people are Idolaters (and so
forth). They live by trade and manufactures and have great store of
all necessaries, including fish in great abundance. There is also much
game, both beast and bird, insomuch that for a Venice groat you can
have three good pheasants.{1}


  NOTE 1.—Paukin is PAO-YING-Hien [a populous place, considerably
  below the level of the canal (_Davis, Sketches_, I. pp. 279–280)];
  Cayu is KAO-YU-chau, both cities on the east side of the canal.
  At Kao-yu, the country east of the canal lies some 20 feet below
  the canal level; so low indeed that the walls of the city are not
  visible from the further bank of the canal. To the west is the
  Kao-yu Lake, one of the expanses of water spoken of by Marco, and
  which threatens great danger to the low country on the east. (See
  _Alabaster’s Journey_ in _Consular Reports_ above quoted, p. 5 [and
  _Gandar, Canal Impérial_, p. 17.—H. C.].)

  There is a fine drawing of Pao-ying, by Alexander, in the Staunton
  collection, British Museum.




                            CHAPTER LXVIII.

               OF THE CITIES OF TIJU, TINJU, AND YANJU.


When you leave Cayu, you ride another day to the south-east through
a constant succession of villages and fields and fine farms until
you come to TIJU, which is a city of no great size but abounding in
everything. The people are Idolaters (and so forth). There is a great
amount of trade, and they have many vessels. And you must know that
on your left hand, that is towards the east, and three days’ journey
distant, is the Ocean Sea. At every place between the sea and the
city salt is made in great quantities. And there is a rich and noble
city called TINJU, at which there is produced salt enough to supply
the whole province, and I can tell you it brings the Great Kaan an
incredible revenue. The people are Idolaters and subject to the Kaan.
Let us quit this, however, and go back to Tiju.{1}

Again, leaving Tiju, you ride another day towards the south-east,
and at the end of your journey you arrive at the very great and noble
city of YANJU, which has seven-and-twenty other wealthy cities under
its administration; so that this Yanju is, you see, a city of great
importance.{2} It is the seat of one of the Great Kaan’s Twelve Barons,
for it has been chosen to be one of the Twelve _Sings_. The people
are Idolaters and use paper-money, and are subject to the Great Kaan.
And Messer Marco Polo himself, of whom this book speaks, did govern
this city for three full years, by the order of the Great Kaan.{3} The
people live by trade and manufactures, for a great amount of harness
for knights and men-at-arms is made there. And in this city and its
neighbourhood a large number of troops are stationed by the Kaan’s
orders.

There is no more to say about it. So now I will tell you about two
great provinces of Manzi which lie towards the west. And first of that
called Nanghin.


  NOTE 1.—Though the text would lead us to look for _Tiju_ on the
  direct line between Kao-yu and Yang-chau, and like them on the
  canal bank (indeed one MS., C. of Pauthier, specifies its standing
  on the same river as the cities already passed, _i.e._ on the
  canal), we seem constrained to admit the general opinion that this
  is TAI-CHAU, a town lying some 25 miles at least to the eastward of
  the canal, but apparently connected with it by a navigable channel.

  _Tinju_ or _Chinju_ (for both the G. T. and Ramusio read _Cingui_)
  cannot be identified with certainty. But I should think it likely,
  from Polo’s “geographical style,” that when he spoke of the sea
  as three days distant he had this city in view, and that it is
  probably TUNG-CHAU, near the northern shore of the estuary of
  the Yang-tzŭ, which might be fairly described as three days from
  Tai-chau. Mr. Kingsmill identifies it with I-chin hien, the great
  port on the Kiang for the export of the Yang-chau salt. This is
  possible; but I-chin lies _west_ of the canal, and though the
  form _Chinju_ would really represent I-chin as then named, such a
  position seems scarcely compatible with the way, vague as it is, in
  which Tinju or Chinju is introduced. Moreover, we shall see that
  I-chin is spoken of hereafter. (_Kingsmill_ in _N. and Q. Ch. and
  Japan_, I. 53.)

  NOTE 2.—Happily, there is no doubt that this is YANG-CHAU, one
  of the oldest and most famous great cities of China. [Abulfeda
  (_Guyard_, II. ii. 122) says that Yang-chau is the capital of the
  Faghfûr of China, and that he is called Tamghâdj-khan.—H. C.] Some
  five-and-thirty years after Polo’s departure from China, Friar
  Odoric found at this city a House of his own Order (Franciscans),
  and three Nestorian churches. The city also appears in the Catalan
  Map as _Iangio_. Yang-chau suffered greatly in the T’aï-P’ing
  rebellion, but its position is an “obligatory point” for commerce,
  and it appears to be rapidly recovering its prosperity. It is the
  headquarters of the salt manufacture, and it is also now noted for
  a great manufacture of sweetmeats (See _Alabaster’s Report_, as
  above, p. 6.)

  [Illustration: Yang chau: the three Cities Under the Sung.]

  [Through the kindness of the late Father H. Havret, S.J., of
  Zi-ka-wei, I am enabled to give two plans from the Chronicles of
  Yang-chau, _Yang-chau fu ché_ (ed. 1733); one bears the title: “The
  Three Cities under the Sung,” and the other: “The Great City under
  the Sung.” The three cities are _Pao yew cheng_, built in 1256,
  _Sin Pao-cheng_ or _Kia cheng_, built after 1256, and _Tacheng_,
  the “Great City,” built in 1175; in 1357, Ta cheng was rebuilt,
  and in 1557 it was augmented, taking the place of the three cities;
  from 553 B.C. until the 12th century, Yang-chau had no less than
  five enclosures; the governor’s yamen stood where a cross is marked
  in the Great City. Since Yang-chau has been laid in ruins by the
  T’aï-P’ing insurgents, these plans offer now a new interest.—H. C.]

  [Illustration: Yang-chau: the Great City under the Sung.]

  NOTE 3.—What I have rendered “Twelve _Sings_” is in the G. T.
  “douze _sajes_,” and in Pauthier’s text “_sieges_.” It seems to me
  a reasonable conclusion that the original word was _Sings_ (see I.
  432, _supra_); anyhow that was the proper term for the thing meant.

  In his note on this chapter, Pauthier produces evidence that
  Yang-chau was the seat of a _Lu_ or circuit[1] from 1277, and also
  of a _Sing_ or Government-General, but only for the first year
  after the conquest, viz. 1276–1277, and he seems (for his argument
  is obscure) to make from this the unreasonable deduction that at
  this period Kúblái placed Marco Polo—who could not be more than
  twenty-three years of age, and had been but two years in Cathay—in
  charge either of the general government, or of an important
  district government in the most important province of the empire.

  In a later note M. Pauthier speaks of 1284 as the date at which the
  _Sing_ of the province of Kiang-ché was transferred from Yang-chau
  to Hang-chau; this is probably to be taken as a correction of
  the former citations, and it better justifies Polo’s statement.
  (_Pauthier_, pp. 467, 492.)

  I do not think that we are to regard Marco as having held at any
  time the important post of Governor-General of Kiang-ché. The
  expressions in the G. T. are: “_Meser Marc Pol meisme, celui de
  cui trate ceste livre, seingneurie ceste cité por trois anz._”
  Pauthier’s MS. A. appears to read: “_Et ot seigneurie, Marc Pol, en
  ceste cité, trois ans._” These expressions probably point to the
  government of the _Lu_ or circuit of Yang-chau, just as we find in
  ch. lxxiii. another Christian, Mar Sarghis, mentioned as Governor
  of Chin-kiang fu for the same term of years, that city being also
  the head of a _Lu_. It is remarkable that in Pauthier’s MS. C.,
  which often contains readings of peculiar value, the passage runs
  (and also in the Bern MS.): “_Et si vous dy que ledit Messire Marc
  Pol, cellui meisme de qui nostre livre parle_, sejourna, _en ceste
  cité de Janguy_ .iii. _ans accompliz, par le commandement du Grant
  Kaan_,” in which the nature of his employment is not indicated
  at all (though _séjourna_ may be an error for _seigneura_). The
  impression of his having been Governor-General is mainly due to the
  Ramusian version, which says distinctly indeed that “_M. Marco Polo
  di commissione del Gran Can n’ebbe il governo tre anni continui_
  in luogo di un dei detti Baroni,” but it is very probable that
  this is a gloss of the translator. I should conjecture his rule at
  Yang-chau to have been between 1282, when we know he was at the
  capital (vol. i. p. 422), and 1287–1288, when he must have gone on
  his first expedition to the Indian Seas.

    Mongols, intermediate between the _Sing_ and the _Fu_, or

                    CONCERNING THE CITY OF NANGHIN.


Nanghin is a very noble Province towards the west. The people are
Idolaters (and so forth) and live by trade and manufactures. They have
silk in great abundance, and they weave many fine tissues of silk and
gold. They have all sorts of corn and victuals very cheap, for the
province is a most productive one. Game also is abundant, and lions
too are found there. The merchants are great and opulent, and the
Emperor draws a large revenue from them, in the shape of duties on the
goods which they buy and sell.{1}

And now I will tell you of the very noble city of Saianfu, which well
deserves a place in our book, for there is a matter of great moment to
tell about it.


  NOTE 1.—The name and direction from Yang-chau are probably
  sufficient to indicate (as Pauthier has said) that this is
  NGAN-KING on the Kiang, capital of the modern province of
  Ngan-hwei. The more celebrated city of _Nan-king_ did not bear that
  name in our traveller’s time.

  Ngan-king, when recovered from the T’aï-P’ing in 1861, was the
  scene of a frightful massacre by the Imperialists. They are said to
  have left neither man, woman, nor child alive in the unfortunate
  city. (_Blakiston_, p. 55.)




                             CHAPTER LXX.

        CONCERNING THE VERY NOBLE CITY OF SAIANFU, AND HOW ITS
                         CAPTURE WAS EFFECTED.


Saianfu is a very great and noble city, and it rules over twelve
other large and rich cities, and is itself a seat of great trade and
manufacture. The people are Idolaters (and so forth). They have much
silk, from which they weave fine silken stuffs; they have also a
quantity of game, and in short the city abounds in all that it behoves
a noble city to possess.

Now you must know that this city held out against the Great Kaan for
three years after the rest of Manzi had surrendered. The Great Kaan’s
troops made incessant attempts to take it, but they could not succeed
because of the great and deep waters that were round about it, so that
they could approach from one side only, which was the north. And I tell
you they never would have taken it, but for a circumstance that I am
going to relate.

You must know that when the Great Kaan’s host had lain three years
before the city without being able to take it, they were greatly
chafed thereat. Then Messer Nicolo Polo and Messer Maffeo and Messer
Marco said: “We could find you a way of forcing the city to surrender
speedily;” whereupon those of the army replied, that they would be
right glad to know how that should be. All this talk took place in the
presence of the Great Kaan. For messengers had been despatched from
the camp to tell him that there was no taking the city by blockade,
for it continually received supplies of victual from those sides which
they were unable to invest; and the Great Kaan had sent back word that
take it they must, and find a way how. Then spoke up the two brothers
and Messer Marco the son, and said: “Great Prince, we have with us
among our followers men who are able to construct mangonels which shall
cast such great stones that the garrison will never be able to stand
them, but will surrender incontinently, as soon as the mangonels or
trebuchets shall have shot into the town.”{1}

The Kaan bade them with all his heart have such mangonels made as
speedily as possible. Now Messer Nicolo and his brother and his son
immediately caused timber to be brought, as much as they desired, and
fit for the work in hand. And they had two men among their followers,
a German and a Nestorian Christian, who were masters of that business,
and these they directed to construct two or three mangonels capable of
casting stones of 300 lbs. weight. Accordingly they made three fine
mangonels, each of which cast stones of 300 lbs. weight and more.{2}
And when they were complete and ready for use, the Emperor and the
others were greatly pleased to see them, and caused several stones to
be shot in their presence; whereat they marvelled greatly and greatly
praised the work. And the Kaan ordered that the engines should be
carried to his army which was at the leaguer of Saianfu.{3}

And when the engines were got to the camp they were forthwith set up,
to the great admiration of the Tartars. And what shall I tell you? When
the engines were set up and put in gear, a stone was shot from each of
them into the town. These took effect among the buildings, crashing
and smashing through everything with huge din and commotion. And when
the townspeople witnessed this new and strange visitation they were
so astonished and dismayed that they wist not what to do or say. They
took counsel together, but no counsel could be suggested how to escape
from these engines, for the thing seemed to them to be done by sorcery.
They declared that they were all dead men if they yielded not, so
they determined to surrender on such conditions as they could get.{4}
Wherefore they straightway sent word to the commander of the army that
they were ready to surrender on the same terms as the other cities of
the province had done, and to become the subjects of the Great Kaan;
and to this the captain of the host consented.

So the men of the city surrendered, and were received to terms; and
this all came about through the exertions of Messer Nicolo, and Messer
Maffeo, and Messer Marco; and it was no small matter. For this city and
province is one of the best that the Great Kaan possesses, and brings
him in great revenues.{5}


  NOTE 1.—Pauthier’s MS. C. here says: “When the Great Kaan, and the
  Barons about him, and the messengers from the camp ... heard this,
  they all marvelled greatly; for I tell you that in all those parts
  they know nothing of mangonels or trebuchets; and they were so far
  from being accustomed to employ them in their wars that they had
  never even seen them, nor knew what they were.” The MS. in question
  has in this narrative several statements peculiar to itself,[1]
  as indeed it has in various other passages of the book; and these
  often look very like the result of revision by Polo himself. Yet
  I have not introduced the words just quoted into our text, because
  they are, as we shall see presently, notoriously contrary to fact.

  NOTE 2.—The same MS. has here a passage which I am unable to
  understand. After the words “300 lbs. and more,” it goes on: “Et
  la veoit l’en voler moult loing, desquelles pierres _il en y avoit
  plus de_ lx _routes qui tant montoit l’une comme l’autre_.” The Bern
  has the same. [Perhaps we might read lx _en routes_, viz. on their
  way.—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—I propose here to enter into some detailed explanation
  regarding the military engines that were in use in the Middle
  Ages.[2] None of these depended for their motive force on _torsion_
  like the chief engines used in classic times. However numerous
  the names applied to them, with reference to minor variations in
  construction or differences in power, they may all be reduced
  to two classes, viz. _great slings_ and _great crossbows_. And
  this is equally true of all the three great branches of mediæval
  civilisation—European, Saracenic, and Chinese. To the first class
  belonged the _Trebuchet_ and _Mangonel_; to the second, the
  _Winch-Arblast_ (Arbalète à Tour), _Springold_ etc.

  Whatever the ancient _Balista_ may have been, the word in mediæval
  Latin seems always to mean some kind of crossbow. The heavier
  crossbows were wound up by various aids, such as winches, ratchets,
  etc. They discharged stone shot, leaden bullets, and short,
  square-shafted arrows called _quarrels_, and these with such force
  we are told as to pierce a six-inch post (?). But they were worked
  so slowly in the field that they were no match for the long-bow,
  which shot five or six times to their once. The great machines
  of this kind were made of wood, of steel, and very frequently of
  horn;[3] and the bow was sometimes more than 30 feet in length.
  Dufour calculates that such a machine could shoot an arrow of half
  a kilogram in weight to a distance of about 860 yards.

  The _Trebuchet_ consisted of a long tapering shaft or beam, pivoted
  at a short distance from the butt end on a pair of strong pyramidal
  trestles. At the other end of the shaft a sling was applied, one
  cord of which was firmly attached by a ring, whilst the other hung
  in a loop over an iron hook which formed the extremity of the
  shaft. The power employed to discharge the sling was either the
  strength of a number of men, applied to ropes which were attached
  to the short end of the shaft or lever, or the weight of a heavy
  counterpoise hung from the same, and suddenly released.

  [Illustration: Mediæval Artillery Engines. Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
    Chinese; Figs. 6, 7, 8, Saracenic; the rest Frank.]

  Supposing the latter force to be employed, the long end of the
  shaft was drawn down by a windlass; the sling was laid forward in
  a wooden trough provided for it, and charged with the shot. The
  counterpoise was, of course, now aloft, and was so maintained by a
  detent provided with a trigger. On pulling this, the counterpoise
  falls and the shaft flies upwards drawing the sling. When a certain
  point is reached the loop end of the sling releases itself from the
  hook, and the sling flies abroad whilst the shot is projected in
  its parabolic flight.[4] To secure the most favourable result the
  shot should have acquired its maximum velocity, and should escape
  at an angle of about 45°. The attainment of this required certain
  proportions between the different dimensions of the machine and
  the weight of the shot, for which, doubtless, traditional rules of
  thumb existed among the mediæval engineers.

  The ordinary shot consisted of stones carefully rounded. But
  for these were substituted on occasion rough stones with fuses
  attached,[5] pieces of red-hot iron, pots of fused metal, or casks
  full of Greek fire or of foul matter to corrupt the air of the
  besieged place. Thus carrion was shot into Negropont from such
  engines by Mahomed II. The Cardinal Octavian, besieging Modena in
  1249, slings a dead ass into the town. Froissart several times
  mentions such measures, as at the siege of Thin l’Evêque on the
  Scheldt in 1340, when “the besiegers by their engines flung dead
  horses and other carrion into the castle to poison the garrison by
  their smell.” In at least one instance the same author tells how a
  living man, an unlucky messenger from the Castle of Auberoche, was
  caught by the besiegers, thrust into the sling with the letters
  that he bore hung round his neck, and shot into Auberoche, where
  he fell dead among his horrified comrades. And Lipsius quotes
  from a Spanish Chronicle the story of a virtuous youth, Pelagius,
  who, by order of the Tyrant Abderramin, was shot across the
  Guadalquivir, but lighted unharmed upon the rocks beyond. Ramon
  de Muntaner relates how King James of Aragon, besieging Majorca
  in 1228, vowed vengeance against the Saracen King because he shot
  Christian prisoners into the besiegers’ camp with his trebuchets
  (pp. 223–224). We have mentioned one kind of corruption propagated
  by these engines; the historian Wassáf tells of another. When
  the garrison of Dehli refused to open the gates to Aláuddin
  Khilji after the murder of his uncle, Firúz (1296), he loaded his
  mangonels with bags of gold and shot them into the fort, a measure
  which put an end to the opposition.

  Ibn Batuta, forty years later, describes Mahomed Tughlak as
  entering Dehli accompanied by elephants carrying small _balistae_
  (_ra’ádát_), from which gold and silver pieces were shot among the
  crowd. And the same king, when he had given the crazy and cruel
  order that the population of Dehli should evacuate the city and
  depart to Deogir, 900 miles distant, having found two men skulking
  behind, one of whom was paralytic and the other blind, caused the
  former to be shot from a mangonel. (_I. B._ III. 395, 315.)

  Some old drawings represent the shaft as discharging the shot
  from a kind of spoon at its extremity, without the aid of a sling
  (_e.g._ fig. 13); but it may be doubted if this was actually used,
  for the sling was essential to the efficiency of the engine. The
  experiments and calculations of Dufour show that without the sling,
  other things remaining the same, the range of the shot would be
  reduced by more than a half.

  In some of these engines the counterpoise, consisting of a timber
  case filled with stones, sand, or the like, was permanently
  fixed to the butt-end of the shaft. This seems to have been the
  _Trebuchet_ proper. In others the counterpoise hung free on a pivot
  from the yard; whilst a third kind (as in fig. 17) combined both
  arrangements. The first kind shot most steadily and truly; the
  second with more force.

  Those machines, in which the force of men pulling cords took the
  place of the counterpoise, could not discharge such weighty shot,
  but they could be worked more rapidly, and no doubt could be made
  of lighter scantling. Mr. Hewitt points out a curious resemblance
  between this kind of Trebuchet and the apparatus used on the Thames
  to raise the cargo from the hold of a collier.

  The Emperor Napoleon deduces from certain passages in mediæval
  writers that the _Mangonel_ was similar to the Trebuchet, but
  of lighter structure and power. But often certainly the term
  Mangonel seems to be used generically for all machines of this
  class. Marino Sanudo uses no word but _Machina_, which he appears
  to employ as the Latin equivalent of _Mangonel_, whilst the machine
  which he describes is a Trebuchet with moveable counterpoise. The
  history of the word appears to be the following. The Greek word
  μάγγανον, “a piece of witchcraft,” came to signify a juggler’s
  trick, an unexpected contrivance (in modern slang “_a jim_”), and
  so specially a military engine. It seems to have reached this
  specific meaning by the time of Hero the Younger, who is believed
  to have written in the first half of the 7th century. From the
  form μαγγανικὸν the Orientals got _Manganíḳ_ and _Manjániḳ_,[6]
  whilst the Franks adopted _Mangona_ and _Mangonella_. Hence the
  verbs _manganare_ and _amanganare_, to batter and crush with such
  engines, and eventually our verb “to mangle.” Again, when the use
  of gunpowder rendered these warlike engines obsolete, perhaps their
  ponderous counterweights were utilised in the peaceful arts of
  the laundry, and hence gave us our substantive “the Mangle” (It.
  _Mangano_)!

  The Emperor Napoleon, when Prince President, caused some
  interesting experiments in the matter of mediæval artillery to
  be carried out at Vincennes, and a full-sized trebuchet was
  constructed there. With a shaft of 33 feet 9 inches in length,
  having a permanent counterweight of 3300 lbs. and a pivoted
  counterweight of 6600 lbs. more, the utmost effect attained
  was the discharge of an iron 24-kilo. shot to a range of 191
  yards, whilst a 12½-inch shell, filled with earth, ranged to 131
  yards. The machine suffered greatly at each discharge, and it
  was impracticable to increase the counterpoise to 8000 kilos.,
  or 17,600 lbs. as the Prince desired. It was evident that the
  machine was not of sufficiently massive structure. But the
  officers in charge satisfied themselves that, with practice in
  such constructions and the use of very massive timber, even the
  exceptional feats recorded of mediæval engineers might be realised.

  Such a case is that cited by Quatremère, from an Oriental author,
  of the discharge of stones weighing 400 _mans_, certainly not
  less than 800 lbs., and possibly much more; or that of the Men
  of Bern, who are reported, when besieging Nidau in 1388, to have
  employed trebuchets which shot daily into the town upwards of 200
  blocks weighing 12 cwt. apiece.[7] Stella relates that the Genoese
  armament sent against Cyprus, in 1373, among other great machines
  had one called _Troja_ (_Truia_?), which cast stones of 12 to 18
  hundredweights; and when the Venetians were besieging the revolted
  city of Zara in 1346, their Engineer, Master Francesco delle
  Barche, shot into the city stones of 3000 lbs. weight.[8] In this
  case the unlucky engineer was “hoist with his own petard,” for
  while he stood adjusting one of his engines, it went off, and shot
  him into the town.

  With reference to such cases the Emperor calculates that a stone
  of 3000 lbs. weight might be shot 77 yards with a counterpoise of
  36,000 lbs. weight, and a shaft 65 feet long. The counterpoise,
  composed of stone shot of 55 lbs. each, might be contained in a
  cubical case of about 5½ feet to the side. The machine would be
  preposterous, but there is nothing impossible about it. Indeed
  in the Album of Villard de Honnecourt, an architect of the 13th
  century, which was published at Paris in 1858, in the notes
  accompanying a plan of a trebuchet (from which Professor Willis
  restored the machine as it is shown in our fig. 19), the artist
  remarks: “It is a great job to heave down the beam, for the
  counterpoise is very heavy. For it consists of a chest full of
  earth which is 2 great toises in length, 8 feet in breadth, and 12
  feet in depth”! (p. 203).

  Such calculations enable us to understand the enormous quantities
  of material said to have been used in some of the larger mediæval
  machines. Thus Abulfeda speaks of one used at the final capture of
  Acre, which was entrusted to the troops of Hamath, and which formed
  a load for 100 carts, of which one was in charge of the historian
  himself. The romance of Richard Cœur de Lion tells how in the
  King’s Fleet an entire ship was taken up by one such machine with
  its gear:—

      “Another schyp was laden yet
       With an engyne hyghte Robinet,
       (It was Richardys o mangonel)
       And all the takyl that thereto fel.”

  Twenty-four machines, captured from the Saracens by St. Lewis
  in his first partial success on the Nile, afforded material for
  stockading his whole camp. A great machine which cumbered the
  Tower of St. Paul at Orléans, and was dismantled previous to the
  celebrated defence against the English, furnished 26 cart-loads of
  timber. (_Abulf. Ann. Muslem_, V. 95–97; _Weber_, II. 56; _Michel’s
  Joinville_, App. p. 278; _Jollois, H. du Siège d’Orléans_, 1833, p.
  12.)

  The _number_ of such engines employed was sometimes very great. We
  have seen that St. Lewis captured 24 at once, and these had been
  employed in the field. Villehardouin says that the fleet which
  went from Venice to the attack of Constantinople carried more than
  300 perriers and mangonels, besides quantities of other engines
  required for a siege (ch. xxxviii). At the siege of Acre in 1291,
  just referred to, the Saracens, according to Makrizi, set 92
  engines in battery against the city, whilst Abulfaraj says 300, and
  a Frank account, of great and small, 666. The larger ones are said
  to have shot stones of “a kantar and even more.” (_Makrizi_, III.
  125; _Reinaud, Chroniques Arabes, etc._, p. 570; _De Excidio Urbis
  Acconis_, in _Martène and Durand_, V. 769.)

  How heavy a _mangonade_ was sometimes kept up may be understood
  from the account of the operations on the Nile, already alluded
  to. The King was trying to run a dam across a branch of the river,
  and had protected the head of his work by “cat-castles” or towers
  of timber, occupied by archers, and these again supported by
  trebuchets, etc., in battery. “And,” says Jean Pierre Sarrasin, the
  King’s Chamberlain, “when the Saracens saw what was going on, they
  planted a great number of engines against ours, and to destroy our
  towers and our causeway they shot such vast quantities of stones,
  great and small, that all men stood amazed. They slung stones,
  and discharged arrows, and shot quarrels from winch-arblasts, and
  pelted us with Turkish darts and Greek fire, and kept up such a
  harassment of every kind against our engines and our men working at
  the causeway, that it was horrid either to see or to hear. Stones,
  darts, arrows, quarrels, and Greek fire came down on them like
  rain.”

  The Emperor Napoleon observes that the direct or grazing fire of
  the great arblasts may be compared to that of guns in more modern
  war, whilst the mangonels represent mortar-fire. And this vertical
  fire was by no means contemptible, at least against buildings of
  ordinary construction. At the sieges of Thin l’Evêque in 1340,
  and Auberoche in 1344, already cited, Froissart says the French
  cast stones in, night and day, so as in a few days to demolish all
  the roofs of the towers, and none within durst venture out of the
  vaulted basement.

  The Emperor’s experiments showed that these machines were capable
  of surprisingly accurate direction. And the mediæval histories
  present some remarkable feats of this kind. Thus, in the attack of
  Mortagne by the men of Hainault and Valenciennes (1340), the latter
  had an engine which was a great annoyance to the garrison; there
  was a clever engineer in the garrison who set up another machine
  against it, and adjusted it so well that the first shot fell
  within 12 paces of the enemy’s engine, the second fell near the
  box, and the third struck the shaft and split it in two.

  Already in the first half of the 13th century, a French poet
  (quoted by Weber) looks forward with disgust to the supercession of
  the feats of chivalry by more mechanical methods of war:—

      “Chevaliers sont esperdus,
       Cil ont auques leur tens perdus;
       Arbalestier et mineor
       Et perrier et engigneor
       Seront dorenavant plus chier.”

  When Gházán Khan was about to besiege the castle of Damascus in
  1300, so much importance was attached to this art that whilst his
  Engineer, a man of reputation therein, was engaged in preparing
  the machines, the Governor of the castle offered a reward of 1000
  dinars for that personage’s head. And one of the garrison was
  daring enough to enter the Mongol camp, stab the Engineer, and
  carry back his head into the castle!

  Marino Sanudo, about the same time, speaks of the range of these
  engines with a prophetic sense of the importance of artillery in
  war:—

  “On this subject (length of range) the engineers and experts of the
  army should employ their very sharpest wits. For if the shot of one
  army, whether engine-stones or pointed projectiles, have a longer
  range than the shot of the enemy, rest assured that the side whose
  artillery hath the longest range will have a vast advantage in
  action. Plainly, if the Christian shot can take effect on the Pagan
  forces, whilst the Pagan shot cannot reach the Christian forces,
  it may be safely asserted that the Christians will continually
  gain ground from the enemy, or, in other words, they will win the
  battle.”

  The importance of these machines in war, and the efforts made
  to render them more effective, went on augmenting till the
  introduction of the still more “villanous saltpetre,” even then,
  however, coming to no sudden halt. Several of the instances that
  we have cited of machines of extraordinary power belong to a time
  when the use of cannon had made some progress. The old engines were
  employed by Timur; in the wars of the Hussites as late as 1422;
  and, as we have seen, up to the middle of that century by Mahomed
  II. They are also distinctly represented on the towers of Aden, in
  the contemporary print of the escalade in 1514, reproduced in this
  volume. (Bk. III. ch. xxxvi.)

  NOTE 4.—Very like this is what the Romance of Cœur de Lion tells
  of the effects of Sir Fulke Doyley’s mangonels on the Saracens of
  _Ebedy_:—

      “Sir Fouke brought good engynes
       Swylke knew but fewe Sarazynes—
             *       *       *

       And sayde it was the devylys dent,” etc.—_Weber_, II. 172.

  NOTE 5.—This chapter is one of the most perplexing in the whole
  book, owing to the chronological difficulties involved.

  SAIANFU is SIANG-YANG FU, which stands on the south bank of the
  River Han, and with the sister city of Fan-ch’eng, on the opposite
  bank, commands the junction of two important approaches to the
  southern provinces, viz. that from Shen-si down the Han, and that
  from Shan-si and Peking down the Pe-ho. Fan-ch’eng seems now to be
  the more important place of the two.

  The name given to the city by Polo is precisely that which
  Siang-yang bears in Rashiduddin, and there is no room for doubt as
  to its identity.

  The Chinese historians relate that Kúblái was strongly advised to
  make the capture of Siang-yang and Fan-ch’eng a preliminary to his
  intended attack upon the Sung. The siege was undertaken in the
  latter part of 1268, and the twin cities held out till the spring
  [March] of 1273. Nor did Kúblái apparently prosecute any other
  operations against the Sung during that long interval.

  Now Polo represents that the long siege of Saianfu, instead of
  being a prologue to the subjugation of Manzi, was the protracted
  epilogue of that enterprise; and he also represents the fall of
  the place as caused by advice and assistance rendered by his
  father, his uncle, and himself, a circumstance consistent only
  with the siege’s having really been such an epilogue to the war.
  For, according to the narrative as it stands in all the texts, the
  Polos _could not_ have reached the Court of Kúblái before the end
  of 1274, _i.e._ a year and a half after the fall of Siang-yang, as
  represented in the Chinese histories.

  The difficulty is not removed, nor, it appears to me, abated in any
  degree, by omitting the name of Marco as one of the agents in this
  affair, an omission which occurs both in Pauthier’s MS. B and in
  Ramusio. Pauthier suggests that the father and uncle may have given
  the advice and assistance in question when on their first visit to
  the Kaan, and when the siege of Siang-yang was first contemplated.
  But this would be quite inconsistent with the assertion that the
  place had held out three years longer than the rest of Manzi, as
  well as with the idea that their aid had abridged the duration of
  the siege, and, in fact, with the spirit of the whole story. It is
  certainly very difficult in this case to justify Marco’s veracity,
  but I am very unwilling to believe that there was no justification
  in the facts.

  It is a very curious circumstance that the historian Wassáf also
  appears to represent Saianfu (see note 5, ch. lxv.) as holding out
  after all the rest of Manzi had been conquered. Yet the Chinese
  annals are systematic, minute, and consequent, and it seems
  impossible to attribute to them such a misplacement of an event
  which they represent as the key to the conquest of Southern China.

  In comparing Marco’s story with that of the Chinese, we find the
  same coincidence in prominent features, accompanying a discrepancy
  in details, that we have had occasion to notice in other cases
  where his narrative intersects history. The Chinese account runs as
  follows:—

  In 1271, after Siang-yang and Fan-ch’eng had held out already
  nearly three years, an Uighúr General serving at the siege,
  whose name was Alihaiya, urged the Emperor to send to the West
  for engineers expert at the construction and working of machines
  casting stones of 150 lbs. weight. With such aid he assured Kúblái
  the place would speedily be taken. Kúblái sent to his nephew Ábáká
  in Persia for such engineers, and two were accordingly sent post
  to China, _Alawating_ of Mufali and his pupil Ysemain of Huli or
  Hiulie (probably _Ala’uddin_ of _Miafaraḳain_ and _Ismael_ of
  _Heri_ or Herat). Kúblái on their arrival gave them military rank.
  They exhibited their skill before the Emperor at Tatu, and in the
  latter part of 1272 they reached the camp before Siang-yang, and
  set up their engines. The noise made by the machines, and the crash
  of the shot as it broke through everything in its fall, caused
  great alarm in the garrison. Fan-ch’eng was first taken by assault,
  and some weeks later Siang-yang surrendered.

  The shot used on this occasion weighed 125 Chinese pounds (if
  _catties_, then equal to about 166 _lbs. avoird._), and penetrated
  7 or 8 feet into the earth.

  Rashiduddin also mentions the siege of Siang-yang, as we learn
  from D’Ohsson. He states that as there were in China none of the
  _Manjaníks_ or Mangonels called _Kumghá_, the Kaan caused a certain
  engineer to be sent from Damascus or Balbek, and the three sons of
  this person, Abubakr, Ibrahim, and Mahomed, with their workmen,
  constructed seven great Manjaníks which were employed against
  SAYANFU, a frontier fortress and bulwark of Manzi.

  We thus see that three different notices of the siege of
  Siang-yang, Chinese, Persian, and Venetian, all concur as to the
  employment of foreign engineers from the West, but all differ as to
  the individuals.

  We have seen that one of the MSS. makes Polo assert that till this
  event the Mongols and Chinese were totally ignorant of mangonels
  and trebuchets. This, however, is quite untrue; and it is not very
  easy to reconcile even the statement, implied in all versions of
  the story, that mangonels of considerable power were unknown in the
  far East, with other circumstances related in Mongol history.

  The Persian History called _Tabaḳát-i-Násiri_ speaks of Aikah Nowin
  the _Manjaníki Khás_ or Engineer-in-Chief to Chinghiz Khan, and his
  corps of ten thousand _Manjaníkis_ or Mangonellers. The Chinese
  histories used by Gaubil also speak of these artillery battalions
  of Chinghiz. At the siege of Kai-fung fu near the Hwang-Ho, the
  latest capital of the Kin Emperors, in 1232, the Mongol General,
  Subutai, threw from his engines great quarters of millstones which
  smashed the battlements and watch-towers on the ramparts, and
  even the great timbers of houses in the city. In 1236 we find the
  Chinese garrison of Chinchau (_I-chin-hien_ on the Great Kiang near
  the Great Canal) repelling the Mongol attack, partly by means of
  their stone shot. When Hulaku was about to march against Persia
  (1253), his brother, the Great Kaan Mangku, sent to _Cathay_ to
  fetch thence 1000 families of mangonellers, naphtha-shooters,
  and arblasteers. Some of the crossbows used by these latter had
  a range, we are told, of 2500 paces! European history bears some
  similar evidence. One of the Tartar characteristics reported by a
  fugitive Russian Archbishop, in Matt. Paris (p. 570 under 1244),
  is: “_Machinas habent multiplices, recte et fortiter jacientes_.”

  It is evident, therefore, that the Mongols and Chinese _had_
  engines of war, but that they were deficient in some advantage
  possessed by those of the Western nations. Rashiduddin’s expression
  as to their having no _Kumghá_ mangonels, seems to be unexplained.
  Is it perhaps an error for _Ḳarábughá_, the name given by the
  Turks and Arabs to a kind of great mangonel? This was known also
  in Europe as Carabaga, Calabra, etc. It is mentioned under the
  former name by Marino Sanudo, and under the latter, with other
  quaintly-named engines, by William of Tudela, as used by Simon de
  Montfort the Elder against the Albigenses:—

      “E dressa sos _Calabres_, et foi _Mal Vezina_
       E sas autras pereiras, e _Dona_, e _Reina_;
       Pessia les autz murs e la sala peirina.”[9]

      (“He set up his _Calábers_, and likewise his _Ill-Neighbours_,
        With many a more machine, this the _Lady_, that the _Queen_,
        And breached the lofty walls, and smashed the stately Halls.”)

  Now, in looking at the Chinese representations of their ancient
  mangonels, which are evidently genuine, and of which I have
  given some specimens (figs. I, 2, 3), I see none worked by
  the counterpoise; all (and there are six or seven different
  representations in the work from which these are taken) are shown
  as worked by man-ropes. Hence, probably, the improvement brought
  from the West was essentially the use of the counterpoised lever.
  And, after I had come to this conclusion, I found it to be the view
  of Captain Favé. (See _Du Feu Grégeois_, by MM. Reinaud and Favé,
  p. 193.)

  In Ramusio the two Polos propose to Kúblái to make “_mangani al
  modo di Ponente_”; and it is worthy of note that in the campaigns
  of Aláuddin Khilji and his generals in the Deccan, _circa_ 1300,
  frequent mention is made of the _Western Manjaniks_ and their great
  power. (See _Elliot_, III. 75, 78, etc.)

  Of the kind worked by man-ropes must have been that huge mangonel
  which Mahomed Ibn Kásim, the conqueror of Sind, set in battery
  against the great Dagoba of Daibul, and which required 500 men to
  work it. Like Simon de Montfort’s it had a tender name; it was
  called “The Bride.” (_Elliot_, I. 120.)

  Before quitting this subject, I will quote a curious passage from
  the History of the Sung Dynasty, contributed to the work of Reinaud
  and Favé by M. Stanislas Julien: “In the 9th year of the period
  Hien-shun (A.D. 1273) the frontier cities had fallen into the hands
  of the enemy (Tartars). The _Pao_ (or engines for shooting) of the
  Hwei-Hwei (Mahomedans) were imitated, but in imitating them very
  ingenious improvements were introduced, and _pao_ of a different
  and very superior kind were constructed. Moreover, an extraordinary
  method was invented of neutralising the effects of the enemy’s
  _pao_. Ropes were made of rice-straw 4 inches thick, and 34 feet
  in length. Twenty such ropes were joined, applied to the tops of
  buildings, and covered with clay. In this manner the fire-arrows,
  fire-_pao_, and even the pao casting stones of 100 lbs. weight,
  could cause no damage to the towers or houses.” (_Ib._ 196; also
  for previous parts of this note, _Visdelou_, 188; _Gaubil_, 34,
  155 _seqq._ and 70; _De Mailla_, 329; _Pauthier in loco_ and

  Thomas_, F.R.S.; _Q. Rashid._, pp. 132, 136.) [See I. p. 342.]

  [Captain Gill writes (_River of Golden Sand_, I. p. 148): “The word
  ‘P’ao’ which now means ‘cannon,’ was, it was asserted, found in old
  Chinese books of a date anterior to that in which gunpowder was
  first known to Europeans; hence the deduction was drawn that the
  Chinese were acquainted with gunpowder before it was used in the
  West. But close examination shows that in all old books the radical
  of the character ‘P’ao’ means ‘stone,’ but that in modern books the
  radical of the character ‘P’ao’ means ‘fire’; that the character
  with the radical ‘fire’ only appears in books well known to have
  been written since the introduction of gunpowder into the West; and
  that the old character ‘P’ao’ in reality means ‘Balista.’”—H. C.]

    siege in 1268–73, lately discovered.]

  [“Wheeled boats are mentioned in 1272 at the siege of Siang-yang.
  Kúblái did not decide to ‘go for’ Manzi, _i.e._ the southern of
  the two Chinese Empires, until 1273. Bayan did not start until
  1274, appearing before Hankow in January 1275. Wuhu and Taiping
  surrendered in April; then Chinkiang, Kien K’ang (Nanking), and
  Ning kwoh; the final crushing blow being dealt at Hwai-chan. In
  March 1276, the Manzi Emperor accepted vassaldom. Kiang-nan was
  regularly administered in 1278.” (_E. H. Parker, China Review_,
  xxiv. p. 105.)—H. C.]

  Siang-yang has been twice visited by Mr. A. Wylie. Just before his
  first visit (I believe in 1866) a discovery had been made in the
  city of a quantity of treasure buried at the time of the siege. One
  of the local officers gave Mr. Wylie one of the copper coins, not
  indeed in itself of any great rarity, but worth engraving here on
  account of its connection with the siege commemorated in the text;
  and a little on the principle of Smith the Weaver’s evidence:—“The
  bricks are alive at this day to testify of it; therefore deny it
  not.”

    artillerist, from Acre to Damascus, _pour acheter cornes et glus

    withal (p. 134).

    In the final defence of Acre (1291) we hear of balistae _bipedales_
    (with a forked rest?) and other _vertiginales_ (traversing on a
    pivot?) that shot 3 quarrels at once, and with such force as to
    _stitch_ the Saracens to their bucklers—_cum clypeis consutos

    The crossbow, though apparently indigenous among various tribes
    of Indo-China, seems to have been a new introduction in European
    warfare in the 12th century. William of Brittany in a poem called
    the _Philippis_, speaking of the early days of Philip Augustus,
    says:—

        “Francigenis nostris illis ignota diebus

    Anna Comnena calls it Τζάγρα (which looks like Persian _charkh_),
    “a barbaric bow, totally unknown to the Greeks”; and she gives a
    very lengthy description of it, ending: “Such then are the facts
    about the _Tzagra_, and a truly diabolical affair it is.” (_Alex._

[6] Professor Sprenger informs me that the first mention of the
    _Manjanik_ in Mahomedan history is at the siege of Táyif by Mahomed
    himself, A.D. 630 (and see _Sprenger’s Mohammed_ [German], III.
    330). The _Annales Marbacenses_ in _Pertz_, xvii. 172, say under
    1212, speaking of wars of the Emperor Otho in Germany: “Ibi tunc
    cepit haberi usus instrumenti bellici quod vulgo _tribok_ appellari
    solet.”

    There is a ludicrous Oriental derivation of Manjanik, from the
    Persian: “_Man chi nek_!” “How good am I!” Ibn Khallikan remarks
    that the word must be foreign, because the letters j and ḳ (ج and
    ق) never occur together in genuine Arabic words (_Notes_ by _Mr. E.
    Thomas_, F.R.S.). It may be noticed that the letters in question
    occur together in another Arabic word of foreign origin used by
    Polo, viz. _Játhalíḳ_.

                             CHAPTER LXXI.

        CONCERNING THE CITY OF SINJU AND THE GREAT RIVER KIAN.


You must know that when you leave the city of Yanju, after going 15
miles south-east, you come to a city called SINJU, of no great size,
but possessing a very great amount of shipping and trade. The people
are Idolaters and subject to the Great Kaan, and use paper-money.{1}

And you must know that this city stands on the greatest river in the
world, the name of which is KIAN. It is in some places ten miles wide,
in others eight, in others six, and it is more than 100 days’ journey
in length from one end to the other. This it is that brings so much
trade to the city we are speaking of; for on the waters of that river
merchandize is perpetually coming and going, from and to the various
parts of the world, enriching the city, and bringing a great revenue to
the Great Kaan.

And I assure you this river flows so far and traverses so many
countries and cities that in good sooth there pass and repass on its
waters a great number of vessels, and more wealth and merchandize than
on all the rivers and all the seas of Christendom put together! It
seems indeed more like a Sea than a River.{2} Messer Marco Polo said
that he once beheld at that city 15,000 vessels at one time. And you
may judge, if this city, of no great size, has such a number, how many
must there be altogether, considering that on the banks of this river
there are more than sixteen provinces and more than 200 great cities,
besides towns and villages, all possessing vessels?

Messer Marco Polo aforesaid tells us that he heard from the officer
employed to collect the Great Kaan’s duties on this river that there
passed up-stream 200,000 vessels in the year, without counting those
that passed down! [Indeed as it has a course of such great length,
and receives so many other navigable rivers, it is no wonder that the
merchandize which is borne on it is of vast amount and value. And the
article in largest quantity of all is salt, which is carried by this
river and its branches to all the cities on their banks, and thence to
the other cities in the interior.{3}]

The vessels which ply on this river are decked. They have but one
mast, but they are of great burthen, for I can assure you they carry
(reckoning by our weight) from 4000 up to 12,000 cantars each.{4}

Now we will quit this matter and I will tell you of another city called
CAIJU. But first I must mention a point I had forgotten. You must know
that the vessels on this river, in going up-stream have to be tracked,
for the current is so strong that they could not make head in any other
manner. Now the tow-line, which is some 300 paces in length, is made
of nothing but cane. ’Tis in this way: they have those great canes of
which I told you before that they are some fifteen paces in length;
these they take and split from end to end [into many slender strips],
and then they twist these strips together so as to make a rope of any
length they please. And the ropes so made are stronger than if they
were made of hemp.{5}

[There are at many places on this river hills and rocky eminences
on which the idol-monasteries and other edifices are built; and you
find on its shores a constant succession of villages and inhabited
places.{6}]


  NOTE 1.—The traveller’s diversion from his direct course—_sceloc_
  or south-east, as he regards it—towards Fo-kien, in order to notice
  Ngan-king (as we have supposed) and Siang-yang, has sadly thrown
  out both the old translators and transcribers, and the modern
  commentators. Though the G. Text has here “_quant l’en se part de
  la cité de_ Angui,” I cannot doubt that _Iangui_ (Yanju) is the
  reading intended, and that Polo here comes back to the main line of
  his journey.

  [Illustration: “=Sono sopraquesto fiumein molti luoghi, colline e
    monticelli sassosi, sopra quali sono edificati monasteri d’Idoli, e
    altre stanze....=”]

  I conceive Sinju to be the city which was then called CHÊN-CHAU,
  but now I-CHING HIEN,[1] and which stands on the Kiang as near as
  may be 15 miles from Yang-chau. It is indeed south-west instead
  of south-east, but those who have noted the style of Polo’s
  orientation will not attach much importance to this. I-ching hien
  is still the great port of the Yang-chau salt manufacture, for
  export by the Kiang and its branches to the interior provinces. It
  communicates with the Grand Canal by two branch canals. Admiral
  Collinson, in 1842, remarked the great numbers of vessels lying in
  the creek off I-ching. (See note 1 to ch. lxviii. above; and _J. R.
  G. S._ XVII. 139.)

  [“We anchored at a place near the town of _Y-ching-hien_,
  distinguished by a pagoda. The most remarkable objects that struck
  us here were some enormously large salt-junks of a very singular
  shape, approaching to a crescent, with sterns at least thirty feet
  above the water, and bows that were two-thirds of that height.
  They had ‘bright sides,’ that is, were varnished over the natural
  wood without painting, a very common style in China.” (_Davis,
  Sketches_, II. p. 13.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—The river is, of course, the Great Kiang or Yang-tzŭ Kiang
  (already spoken of in ch. xliv. as the _Kiansui_), which Polo was
  justified in calling the greatest river in the world, whilst the
  New World was yet hidden. The breadth seems to be a good deal
  exaggerated, the length not at all. His expressions about it were
  perhaps accompanied by a mental reference to the term _Dalai_, “The
  Sea,” which the Mongols appear to have given the river. (See _Fr.
  Odoric_, p. 121.) The Chinese have a popular saying, “_Haï vu ping,
  Kiang vu ti_,” “Boundless is the Ocean, bottomless the Kiang!”

  NOTE 3.—“The assertion that there is a greater amount of tonnage
  belonging to the Chinese than to all other nations combined, does
  not appear overcharged to those who have seen the swarms of boats
  on their rivers, though it might not be found strictly true.”
  (_Mid. Kingd._ II. 398.) Barrow’s picture of the life, traffic, and
  population on the Kiang, excepting as to specific numbers, quite
  bears out Marco’s account. This part of China suffered so long from
  the wars of the T’ai-P’ing rebellion that to travellers it has
  presented thirty years ago an aspect sadly belying its old fame.
  Such havoc is not readily repaired in a few years, nor in a few
  centuries, but prosperity is reviving, and European navigation is
  making an important figure on the Kiang.

  [From the _Returns of Trade for the Year 1900_ of the Imperial
  Maritime Customs of China, we take the following figures regarding
  the navigation on the Kiang. Steamers entered inwards and cleared
  outwards, under General Regulations at _Chung-King_: 1; 331
  tons; sailing vessels, 2681; 84,862 tons, of which Chinese, 816;
  27,684 tons. At _Ichang_: 314; 231,000 tons, of which Chinese,
  118; 66,944 tons; sailing vessels, all Chinese, 5139; 163,320
  tons. At _Shasi_: 606; 453,818 tons, of which Chinese, 606;
  453,818 tons; no sailing vessels. At _Yochow_: 650; 299,962 tons,
  of which Chinese, 458; 148,112 tons; no sailing vessels; under
  Inland Steam Navigation Rules, 280 Chinese vessels, 20,958 tons.
  At _Hankow_: under General Regulation, Steamers, 2314; 2,101,555
  tons, of which Chinese, 758; 462,424 tons; sailing vessels, 1137;
  166,118 tons, of which Chinese, 1129; 163,724 tons; under Inland
  Steam Navigation Rules, 1682 Chinese vessels, 31,173 tons. At
  _Kiu-Kiang_: under General Regulation, Steamers, 2916; 3,393,514
  tons, of which Chinese, 478; 697,468 tons; sailing vessels, 163;
  29,996 tons, of which Chinese, 160; 27,797 tons; under Inland Steam
  Navigation Rules, 798 Chinese vessels; 21,670 tons. At _Wu-hu_:
  under General Regulation, Steamers, 3395; 3,713,172 tons, of which
  Chinese, 540; 678,362 tons; sailing vessels, 356; 48,299 tons, of
  which Chinese, 355; 47,848 tons; under Inland Steam Navigation
  Rules, 286 Chinese vessels; 4272 tons. At _Nanking_: under General
  Regulation, Steamers, 1672; 1,138,726 tons, of which Chinese, 970;
  713,232 tons; sailing vessels, 290; 36,873 tons, of which Chinese,
  281; 34,985 tons; under Inland Steam Navigation Rules, 30 Chinese
  vessels; 810 tons. At _Chinkiang_: under General Regulation,
  Steamers, 4710; 4,413,452 tons, of which Chinese, 924; 794,724
  tons; sailing vessels, 1793; 294,664 tons, of which Chinese, 1771;
  290,286 tons; under Inland Steam Navigation Rules, 2920; 39,346
  tons, of which Chinese, 1684; 22,776 tons.—H. C.]

  NOTE 4.—✛12,000 _cantars_ would be more than 500 tons, and this
  is justified by the burthen of _Chinese_ vessels on the river; we
  see it is more than doubled by that of some British or American
  steamers thereon. In the passage referred to under Note 1, Admiral
  Collinson speaks of the salt-junks at I-ching as “very remarkable,
  being built nearly in the form of a crescent, the stern rising in
  some of them nearly 30 feet and the prow 20, whilst the mast is 90
  feet high.” These dimensions imply large capacity. Oliphant speaks
  of the old rice-junks for the canal traffic as transporting 200 and
  300 tons (I. 197).

  NOTE 5.—The tow-line in river-boats is usually made (as here
  described) of strips of bamboo twisted. Hawsers are also made of
  bamboo. Ramusio, in this passage, says the boats are tracked by
  horses, ten or twelve to each vessel. I do not find this mentioned
  anywhere else, nor has any traveller in China that I have consulted
  heard of such a thing.

  NOTE 6.—Such eminences as are here alluded to are the Little Orphan
  Rock, Silver Island, and the Golden Island, which is mentioned in
  the following chapter. We give on the preceding page illustrations
  of those three picturesque islands; the Orphan Rock at the top,
  Golden Island in the middle, Silver Island below.

                            CHAPTER LXXII.

                     CONCERNING THE CITY OF CAIJU.


Caiju is a small city towards the south-east. The people are subject to
the Great Kaan and have paper-money. It stands upon the river before
mentioned.{1} At this place are collected great quantities of corn
and rice to be transported to the great city of Cambaluc for the use
of the Kaan’s Court; for the grain for the Court all comes from this
part of the country. You must understand that the Emperor hath caused
a water-communication to be made from this city to Cambaluc, in the
shape of a wide and deep channel dug between stream and stream, between
lake and lake, forming as it were a great river on which large vessels
can ply. And thus there is a communication all the way from this city
of Caiju to Cambaluc; so that great vessels with their loads can go
the whole way. A land road also exists, for the earth dug from those
channels has been thrown up so as to form an embanked road on either
side.{2}

Just opposite to the city of Caiju, in the middle of the River, there
stands a rocky island on which there is an idol-monastery containing
some 200 idolatrous friars, and a vast number of idols. And this Abbey
holds supremacy over a number of other idol-monasteries, just like an
archbishop’s see among Christians.{3}

Now we will leave this and cross the river, and I will tell you of a
city called Chinghianfu.


  NOTE 1.—No place in Polo’s travels is better identified by his
  local indications than this. It is on the Kiang; it is at the
  extremity of the Great Canal from Cambaluc; it is opposite the
  Golden Island and Chin-kiang fu. Hence it is KWA-CHAU, as Murray
  pointed out. Marsden here misunderstands his text, and puts the
  place on the south side of the Kiang.

  Here Van Braam notices that there passed in the course of the day
  more than fifty great rice-boats, most of which could easily carry
  more than 300,000 lbs. of rice. And Mr. Alabaster, in 1868, speaks
  of the canal from Yang-chau to Kwa-chau as “full of junks.”

  [Sir J. F. Davis writes (_Sketches of China_, II. p. 6): “Two ...
  days ... were occupied in exploring the half-deserted town of
  _Kwa-chow_, whose name signifies ‘the island of gourds,’ being
  completely insulated by the river and canal. We took a long walk
  along the top of the walls, which were as usual of great thickness,
  and afforded a broad level platform behind the parapet: the parapet
  itself, about six feet high, did not in thickness exceed the length
  of a brick and a half, and the embrasures were evidently not
  constructed for cannon, being much too high. A very considerable
  portion of the area within the walls consisted of burial-grounds
  planted with cypress; and this alone was a sufficient proof of the
  decayed condition of the place, as in modern or fully inhabited
  cities no person can be buried within the walls. Almost every spot
  bore traces of ruin, and there appeared to be but one good street
  in the whole town; this, however, was full of shops, and as busy as
  Chinese streets always are.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—Rashiduddin gives the following account of the Grand Canal
  spoken of in this passage. “The river of Khanbaligh had,” he says,
  “in the course of time, become so shallow as not to admit the
  entrance of shipping, so that they had to discharge their cargoes
  and send them up to Khanbaligh on pack-cattle. And the Chinese
  engineers and men of science having reported that the vessels
  from the provinces of Cathay, from Machin, and from the cities of
  Khingsai and Zaitún, could no longer reach the court, the Kaan gave
  them orders to dig a great canal into which the waters of the said
  river, and of several others, should be introduced. This canal
  extends for a distance of 40 days’ navigation from Khanbaligh to
  Khingsai and Zaitún, the ports frequented by the ships that come
  from India, and from the city of Machin (Canton). The canal is
  provided with many sluices ... and when vessels arrive at these
  sluices they are hoisted up by means of machinery, whatever be
  their size, and let down on the other side into the water. The
  canal has a width of more than 30 ells. Kúblái caused the sides of
  the embankments to be revetted with stone, in order to prevent the
  earth giving way. Along the side of the canal runs the high road
  to Machin, extending for a space of 40 days’ journey, and this has
  been paved throughout, so that travellers and their animals may get
  along during the rainy season without sinking in the mud.... Shops,
  taverns, and villages line the road on both sides, so that dwelling
  succeeds dwelling without intermission throughout the whole space
  of 40 days’ journey.” (_Cathay_, 259–260.)

  The canal appears to have been [begun in 1289 and to have been
  completed in 1292.—H. C.] though large portions were in use
  earlier. Its chief object was to provide the capital with food.
  Pauthier gives the statistics of the transport of rice by this
  canal from 1283 to the end of Kúblái’s reign, and for some
  subsequent years up to 1329. In the latter year the quantity
  reached 3,522,163 _shi_ or 1,247,633 quarters. As the supplies of
  rice for the capital and for the troops in the Northern Provinces
  always continued to be drawn from Kiang-nan, the distress and
  derangement caused by the recent rebel occupation of that province
  must have been enormous. (_Pauthier_, p. 481–482; _De Mailla_, p.
  439.) Polo’s account of the formation of the canal is exceedingly
  accurate. Compare that given by Mr. Williamson (I. 62).

  NOTE 3.—“On the Kiang, not far from the mouth, is that remarkably
  beautiful little island called the ‘Golden Isle,’ surmounted by
  numerous temples inhabited by the votaries of Buddha or Fo, and
  very correctly described so many centuries since by Marco Polo.”
  (_Davis’s Chinese_, I. 149.) The monastery, according to Pauthier,
  was founded in the 3rd or 4th century, but the name _Kin-Shan_, or
  “Golden Isle,” dates only from a visit of the Emperor K’ang-hi in
  1684.

  The monastery contained one of the most famous Buddhist libraries
  in China. This was in the hands of our troops during the first
  China war, and, as it was intended to remove the books, there
  was no haste made in examining their contents. Meanwhile peace
  came, and the library was restored. It is a pity _now_ that
  the _jus belli_ had not been exercised promptly, for the whole
  establishment was destroyed by the T’ai-P’ings in 1860, and, with
  the exception of the Pagoda at the top of the hill, which was left
  in a dilapidated state, not one stone of the buildings remained
  upon another. The rock had also then ceased to be an island; and
  the site of what not many years before had been a channel with four
  fathoms of water separating it from the southern shore, was covered
  by flourishing cabbage-gardens. (_Gützlaff_ in _J. R. A. S._ XII.

                            CHAPTER LXXIII.

                      OF THE CITY OF CHINGHIANFU.


Chinghianfu is a city of Manzi. The people are Idolaters and subject
to the Great Kaan, and have paper-money, and live by handicrafts and
trade. They have plenty of silk, from which they make sundry kinds of
stuffs of silk and gold. There are great and wealthy merchants in the
place; plenty of game is to be had, and of all kinds of victual.

There are in this city two churches of Nestorian Christians which
were established in the year of our Lord 1278; and I will tell you how
that happened. You see, in the year just named, the Great Kaan sent a
Baron of his whose name was MAR SARGHIS, a Nestorian Christian, to be
governor of this city for three years. And during the three years that
he abode there he caused these two Christian churches to be built, and
since then there they are. But before his time there was no church,
neither were there any Christians.{1}

[Illustration: West Gate of Chin-kiang fu in 1842.]


  NOTE 1.—CHIN-KIANG FU retains its name unchanged. It is one which
  became well known in the war of 1842. On its capture on the 21st
  July in that year, the heroic Manchu commandant seated himself
  among his records and then set fire to the building, making it his
  funeral pyre. The city was totally destroyed in the T’ai-P’ing
  wars, but is rapidly recovering its position as a place of native
  commerce.

  [Chên-kiang, “a name which may be translated ‘River Guard,’ stands
  at the point where the Grand Canal is brought to a junction with
  the waters of the Yang-tzŭ when the channel of the river proper
  begins to expand into an extensive tidal estuary.” (_Treaty Ports
  of China_, p. 421.) It was declared open to foreign trade by the
  Treaty of Tien-Tsin in 1858.—H. C.]

  _Mar Sarghis_ (or Dominus Sergius) appears to have been a common
  name among Armenian and other Oriental Christians. As Pauthier
  mentions, this very name is one of the names of Nestorian priests
  inscribed in Syriac on the celebrated monument of Si-ngan fu.

  [In the description of Chin-kiang quoted by the Archimandrite
  Palladius (see vol. i. p. 187, note 3), a Christian monastery
  or temple is mentioned: “The temple _Ta-hing-kuo-sze_ stands
  in Chin-kiang fu, in the quarter called _Kia-t’ao h’eang_. It
  was built in the 18th year of _Chi-yuen_ (A.D. 1281) by the
  _Sub-darugachi, Sie-li-ki-sze_ (Sergius). _Liang Siang_, the
  teacher in the Confucian school, wrote a commemorative inscription
  for him.” From this document we see that “_Sie-mi-sze-hien_
  (Samarcand) is distant from China 100,000 li (probably a mistake
  for 10,000) to the north-west. It is a country where the religion
  of the _Ye-li-k’o-wen_ dominates.... The founder of the religion
  was called _Ma-rh Ye-li-ya_. He lived and worked miracles a
  thousand five hundred years ago. _Ma Sie-li-ki-sze_ (Mar Sergius)
  is a follower of him.” (_Chinese Recorder_, VI. p. 108).—H. C.]

  From this second mention of _three years_ as a term of government,
  we may probably gather that this was the usual period for the
  tenure of such office. (_Mid. Kingd._, I. 86; _Cathay_, p. xciii.)




                            CHAPTER LXXIV.

         OF THE CITY OF CHINGINJU AND THE SLAUGHTER OF CERTAIN
                             ALANS THERE.


Leaving the city of Chinghianfu and travelling three days south-east
through a constant succession of busy and thriving towns and villages,
you arrive at the great and noble city of CHINGINJU. The people are
Idolaters, use paper-money, and are subject to the Great Kaan. They
live by trade and handicrafts, and they have plenty of silk. They have
also abundance of game, and of all manner of victuals, for it is a most
productive territory.{1}

Now I must tell you of an evil deed that was done, once upon a time, by
the people of this city, and how dearly they paid for it.

You see, at the time of the conquest of the great province of Manzi,
when Bayan was in command, he sent a company of his troops, consisting
of a people called Alans, who are Christians, to take this city.{2}
They took it accordingly, and when they had made their way in, they
lighted upon some good wine. Of this they drank until they were all
drunk, and then they lay down and slept like so many swine. So when
night fell, the townspeople, seeing that they were all dead-drunk, fell
upon them and slew them all; not a man escaped.

And when Bayan heard that the townspeople had thus treacherously slain
his men, he sent another Admiral of his with a great force, and stormed
the city, and put the whole of the inhabitants to the sword; not a man
of them escaped death. And thus the whole population of that city was
exterminated.{3}

Now we will go on, and I will tell you of another city called Suju.


  NOTE 1.—Both the position and the story which follows identify
  this city with CHANG-CHAU. The name is written in Pauthier’s MSS.
  _Chinginguy_, in the G. T. _Cingiggui_ and _Cinghingui_, in Ramusio
  _Tinguigui_.

  The capture of Chang-chau by Gordon’s force, 11th May 1864, was the
  final achievement of that “Ever Victorious Army.”

  Regarding the territory here spoken of, once so rich and densely
  peopled, Mr. Medhurst says, in reference to the effects of the
  T’ai-P’ing insurrection: “I can conceive of no more melancholy
  sight than the acres of ground that one passes through strewn with
  remains of once thriving cities, and the miles upon miles of rich
  land, once carefully parcelled out into fields and gardens, but now
  only growing coarse grass and brambles—the home of the pheasant,
  the deer, and the wild pig.” (_Foreigner in Far Cathay_, p. 94.)

  NOTE 2.—The relics of the Alans were settled on the northern skirts
  of the Caucasus, where they made a stout resistance to the Mongols,
  but eventually became subjects of the Khans of Sarai. The name
  by which they were usually known in Asia in the Middle Ages was
  _Aas_, and this name is assigned to them by Carpini, Rubruquis, and
  Josafat Barbaro, as well as by Ibn Batuta. Mr. Howorth has lately
  denied the identity of Alans and Aas; but he treats the question as
  all one with the identity of Alans and Ossethi, which is another
  matter, as may be seen in Vivien de St. Martin’s elaborate paper on
  the Alans (_N. Ann. des Voyages_, 1848, tom. 3, p. 129 _seqq._).
  The Alans are mentioned by the Byzantine historian, Pachymeres,
  among nations whom the Mongols had assimilated to themselves and
  adopted into their military service. Gaubil, without being aware
  of the identity of the _Asu_ (as the name _Aas_ appears to be
  expressed in the Chinese Annals), beyond the fact that they dwelt
  somewhere near the Caspian, observes that this people, after they
  were conquered, furnished many excellent officers to the Mongols;
  and he mentions also that when the Mongol army was first equipt
  for the conquest of Southern China, many officers took service
  therein from among the Uighúrs, Persians, and Arabs, Kincha (people
  of Kipchak), the _Asu_ and other foreign nations. We find also,
  at a later period of the Mongol history (1336), letters reaching
  Pope Benedict XII. from several Christian Alans holding high
  office at the court of Cambaluc—one of them being a _Chingsang_ or
  Minister of the First Rank, and another a _Fanchang_ or Minister
  of the Second Order—in which they conveyed their urgent request
  for the nomination of an Archbishop in succession to the deceased
  John of Monte Corvino. John Marignolli speaks of those Alans as
  “the greatest and noblest nation in the world, the fairest and
  bravest of men,” and asserts that in his day there were 30,000 of
  them in the Great Kaan’s service, and all, at least nominally,
  Christians.[1] Rashiduddin also speaks of the Alans as Christians;
  though Ibn Batuta certainly mentions the _Aas_ as Mahomedans.
  We find Alans about the same time (in 1306) fighting well in
  the service of the Byzantine Emperors (_Muntaner_, p. 449). All
  these circumstances render Marco’s story of a corps of Christian
  Alans in the army of Bayan perfectly consistent with probability.
  (_Carpini_, p. 707; _Rub._, 243; _Ramusio_, II. 92; _I. B._ II.
  428; _Gaubil_, 40, 147; _Cathay_, 314 _seqq._)

  [Mr. Rockhill writes (_Rubruck_, p. 88, note): “The Alans or Aas
  appear to be identical with the An-ts’ai or A-lan-na of the _Hou
  Han shu_ (bk. 88, 9), of whom we read that ‘they led a pastoral
  life N.W. of Sogdiana (K’ang-chü) in a plain bounded by great lakes
  (or swamps), and in their wanderings went as far as the shores of
  the Northern Ocean.’ (Ma Twan-lin, bk. 338.) _Pei-shih_ (bk. 97,
  12) refers to them under the name of Su-tê and Wen-na-sha (see also
  _Bretschneider, Med. Geog._, 258, _et seq._). Strabo refers to them
  under the name of Aorsi, living to the north but contiguous to
  the Albani, whom some authors confound with them, but whom later
  Armenian historians carefully distinguish from them (_De Morgan,
  Mission_, i. 232). Ptolemy speaks of this people as the ‘Scythian
  Alans’ (Ἀλανοί Σκύθαι); but the first definite mention of them in
  classical authors is, according to Bunbury (ii. 486), found in
  Dionysius Periergetes (305), who speaks of the άλκήεντες Ἀλανοί.
  (See also _De Morgan_, i. 202, and _Deguignes_, ii. 279 _et seq._)

  “Ammianus Marcellinus (xxxi. 348) says, the Alans were a congeries
  of tribes living E. of the Tanais (Don), and stretching far
  into Asia. ‘Distributed over two continents, all these nations,
  whose various names I refrain from mentioning, though separated
  by immense tracts of country in which they pass their vagabond
  existence, have with time been confounded under the generic
  appellation of Alans.’ Ibn Alathir, at a later date, also refers to
  the Alans as ‘formed of numerous nations.’ (_Dulaurier_, xiv. 455).

  “Conquered by the Huns in the latter part of the fourth century,
  some of the Alans moved westward, others settled on the northern
  slopes of the Caucasus; though long prior to that, in A.D. 51,
  they had, as allies of the Georgians, ravaged Armenia. (See _Yule,
  Cathay_, 316; _Deguignes_, I., pt. ii. 277 _et seq._; and _De
  Morgan_, I. 217, _et seq._)

  “Mirkhond, in the _Tarikhi Wassaf_, and other Mohammedan writers
  speak of the Alans _and_ As. However this may be, it is thought
  that the Oss or Ossetes of the Caucasus are their modern
  representatives (_Klaproth, Tabl. hist._, 180; _De Morgan_, i. 202,
  231.)” _Aas_ is the transcription of _A-soo_ (_Yuen-shi_, quoted by
  Devéria, _Notes d’épig._, p. 75). (See _Bretschneider, Med. Res._,
  II., p. 84.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—The Chinese histories do not mention the story of the Alans
  and their fate; but they tell how Chang-chau was first taken by the
  Mongols about April 1275, and two months later recovered by the
  Chinese; how Bayan, some months afterwards, attacked it in person,
  meeting with a desperate resistance; finally, how the place was
  stormed, and how Bayan ordered the whole of the inhabitants to be
  put to the sword. Gaubil remarks that some grievous provocation
  must have been given, as Bayan was far from cruel. Pauthier
  gives original extracts on the subject, which are interesting.
  They picture the humane and chivalrous Bayan on this occasion as
  demoniacal in cruelty, sweeping together all the inhabitants of
  the suburbs, forcing them to construct his works of attack, and
  then butchering the whole of them, boiling down their carcasses,
  and using the fat to grease his mangonels! Perhaps there is some
  misunderstanding as to the _use_ of this barbarous lubricant. For
  Carpini relates that the Tartars, when they cast Greek fire into
  a town, shot with it human fat, for this caused the fire to rage
  inextinguishably.

  Cruelties, like Bayan’s on this occasion, if exceptional with him,
  were common enough among the Mongols generally. Chinghiz, at an
  early period in his career, after a victory, ordered seventy great
  caldrons to be heated, and his prisoners to be boiled therein.
  And the “evil deed” of the citizens of Chang-chau fell far short
  of Mongol atrocities. Thus Hulaku, suspecting the Turkoman chief
  Nasiruddin, who had just quitted his camp with 300 men, sent a
  body of horse after him to cut him off. The Mongol officers told
  the Turkoman they had been ordered to give him and his men a
  parting feast; they made them all drunk and then cut their throats.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] I must observe here that the learned Professor Bruun has raised
    doubts whether these Alans of Marignolli’s could be Alans of
    the Caucasus, and if they were not rather _Ohláns_, _i.e._
    Mongol Princes and nobles. There are difficulties certainly
    about Marignolli’s Alans; but obvious difficulties also in this
    explanation.




                             CHAPTER LXXV.

                      OF THE NOBLE CITY OF SUJU.


Suju is a very great and noble city. The people are Idolaters, subjects
of the Great Kaan, and have paper-money. They possess silk in great
quantities, from which they make gold brocade and other stuffs, and
they live by their manufactures and trade.{1}

The city is passing great, and has a circuit of some 60 miles; it hath
merchants of great wealth and an incalculable number of people. Indeed,
if the men of this city and of the rest of Manzi had but the spirit of
soldiers they would conquer the world; but they are no soldiers at all,
only accomplished traders and most skilful craftsmen. There are also in
this city many philosophers and leeches, diligent students of nature.

And you must know that in this city there are 6,000 bridges, all of
stone, and so lofty that a galley, or even two galleys at once, could
pass underneath one of them.{2}

In the mountains belonging to this city, rhubarb and ginger grow in
great abundance; insomuch that you may get some 40 pounds of excellent
fresh ginger for a Venice groat.{3} And the city has sixteen other
great trading cities under its rule. The name of the city, Suju,
signifies in our tongue, “Earth,” and that of another near it, of which
we shall speak presently, called Kinsay, signifies “Heaven;” and these
names are given because of the great splendour of the two cities.{4}

Now let us quit Suju, and go on to another which is called VUJU, one
day’s journey distant; it is a great and fine city, rife with trade and
manufactures. But as there is nothing more to say of it we shall go on
and I will tell you of another great and noble city called VUGHIN. The
people are Idolaters, &c., and possess much silk and other merchandize,
and they are expert traders and craftsmen. Let us now quit Vughin and
tell you of another city called CHANGAN, a great and rich place. The
people are Idolaters, &c., and they live by trade and manufactures.
They make great quantities of sendal of different kinds, and they have
much game in the neighbourhood. There is however nothing more to say
about the place, so we shall now proceed.{5}


  NOTE 1.—SUJU is of course the celebrated city of SU-CHAU in
  Kiang-nan—before the rebellion brought ruin on it, the Paris
  of China. “Everything remarkable was alleged to come from it;
  fine pictures, fine carved-work, fine silks, and fine ladies!”
  (_Fortune_, I. 186.) When the Emperor K’ang-hi visited Su-chau, the
  citizens laid the streets with carpets and silk stuffs, but the
  Emperor dismounted and made his train do the like. (_Davis_, I.
  186.)

  [Su-chau is situated 80 miles west of Shang-hai, 12 miles east
  of the Great Lake, and 40 miles south of the Kiang, in the plain
  between this river and Hang-chau Bay. It was the capital of the
  old kingdom of Wu which was independent from the 12th to the 4th
  centuries (B.C.) inclusive; it was founded by Wu Tzŭ-sü, prime
  minister of King Hoh Lü (514–496 B.C.), who removed the capital of
  Wu from Mei-li (near the modern Ch’ang-chau) to the new site now
  occupied by the city of Su-chau. “Suchau is built in the form of a
  rectangle, and is about three and a half miles from North to South,
  by two and a half in breadth, the wall being twelve or thirteen
  miles in length. There are six gates.” (_Rev. H. C. Du Bose, Chin.
  Rec._, xix. p. 205.) It has greatly recovered since the T’ai-P’ing
  rebellion, and its recapture by General (then Major) Gordon on the
  27th November 1863; Su-chau has been declared open to foreign trade
  on the 26th September 1896, under the provisions of the Japanese
  Treaty of 1895.

  “The great trade of Soochow is silk. In the silk stores are found
  about 100 varieties of satin, and 200 kinds of silks and gauzes....
  The weavers are divided into two guilds, the Nankin and Suchau,
  and have together about 7000 looms. Thousands of men and women are
  engaged in reeling the thread.” (_Rev. H. C. Du Bose, Chin. Rec._,
  xix. pp. 275–276.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—I believe we must not bring Marco to book for the literal
  accuracy of his statements as to the bridges; but all travellers
  have noticed the number and elegance of the bridges of cut stone
  in this part of China; see, for instance, _Van Braam_, II. 107,
  119–120, 124, 126; and _Deguignes_, I. 47, who gives a particular
  account of the arches. These are said to be often 50 or 60 feet in
  span.

  [“Within the city there are, generally speaking, six canals from
  North to South, and six canals from East to West, intersecting one
  another at from a quarter to half a mile. There are a hundred and
  fifty or two hundred bridges at intervals of two or three hundred
  yards; some of these with arches, others with stone slabs thrown
  across, many of which are twenty feet in length. The canals are
  from ten to fifteen feet wide and faced with stone.” (_Rev. H. C.

  NOTE 3.—This statement about the abundance of rhubarb in the hills
  near Su-chau is believed by the most competent authorities to be
  quite erroneous. Rhubarb _is_ exported from Shang-hai, but it is
  brought thither from Hankau on the Upper Kiang, and Hankau receives
  it from the further west. Indeed Mr. Hanbury, in a note on the
  subject, adds his disbelief also that _ginger_ is produced in
  Kiang-nan. And I see in the Shang-hai trade-returns of 1865, that
  there is _no_ ginger among the exports. [Green ginger is mentioned
  in the Shang-hai Trade Reports for 1900 among the exports (p. 309)
  to the amount of 18,756 piculs; none is mentioned at Su-chau.—H. C.]
  Some one, I forget where, has suggested a confusion with Suh-chau
  in Kan-suh, the great rhubarb mart, which seems possible.

  [“Polo is correct in giving Tangut as the native country of Rhubarb
  (_Rheum palmatum_), but no species of Rheum has hitherto been
  gathered by our botanists as far south as Kiang-Su, indeed, not
  even in Shan-tung.” (_Bretschneider, Hist. of Bot. Disc._, I. p.
  5.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 4.—The meanings ascribed by Polo to the names of Su-chau and
  King-szé (Hang-chau) show plainly enough that he was ignorant of
  Chinese. Odoric does not mention Su-chau, but he gives the same
  explanation of Kinsay as signifying the “City of Heaven,” and
  Wassáf also in his notice of the same city has an obscure passage
  about Paradise and Heaven, which is not improbably a corrupted
  reference to the same interpretation.[1] I suspect therefore that
  it was a “Vulgar Error” of the foreign residents in China, probably
  arising out of a misunderstanding of the Chinese adage quoted by
  Duhalde and Davis:—

      “_Shang yeu t’ien t’ang, Hia yeu_ SU HANG!”

      “There’s Paradise above ’tis true,
        But here below we’ve HANG and SU!”

  These two neighbouring cities, in the middle of the beautiful
  tea and silk districts, and with all the advantages of inland
  navigation and foreign trade, combined every source of wealth and
  prosperity, and were often thus coupled together by the Chinese.
  Both are, I believe, now recovering from the effects of devastation
  by T’ai-P’ing occupation and Imperialist recapture; but neither
  probably is one-fifth of what it was.

  The plan of Su-chau which we give is of high interest. It is
  reduced (⅒ the scale) from a rubbing of a plan of the city incised
  on marble measuring 6′ 7″ by 4′ 4″, and which has been preserved
  in the Confucian Temple in Su-chau since A.D. 1247. Marco Polo’s
  eyes have probably rested on this fine work, comparable to the
  famous _Pianta Capitolina_. The engraving on page 183 represents
  one of the gates traced from the rubbing and reduced to _half_
  the scale. It is therefore an authentic representation of Chinese
  fortification in or before the 13th century.[2]

  [“In the southern part of Su-chau is the park, surrounded by a high
  wall, which contains the group of buildings called the Confucian
  Temple. This is the Dragon’s head;—the Dragon Street, running
  directly North, is his body, and the Great Pagoda is his tail. In
  front is a grove of cedars. To one side is the hall where thousands
  of scholars go to worship at the Spring and Autumn Festivals—this
  for the gentry alone, not for the unlettered populace. There is
  a building used for the slaughter of animals, another containing
  a map of the city engraved in stone; a third with tablets and
  astronomical diagrams, and a fourth containing the Provincial
  Library. On each side of the large courts are rooms where are
  placed the tablets of the 500 sages. The main temple is 50 by 70
  feet, and contains the tablet of Confucius and a number of gilded
  boards with mottoes. It is a very imposing structure. On the stone
  dais in front, a mat-shed is erected for the great sacrifices at
  which the official magnates exercise their sacerdotal functions. As
  a tourist beheld the sacred grounds and the aged trees, she said:
  ‘This is the most venerable-looking place I have seen in China.’ On
  the gateway in front, the sage is called ‘The Prince of Doctrine in
  times Past and Present.’” (_Rev. H. C. Du Bose, Chin. Rec._, xix.
  p. 272).—H. C.]

  NOTE 5.—The Geographic Text only, at least of the principal
  Texts, has distinctly the _three_ cities, _Vugui, Vughin,
  Ciangan_. Pauthier identifies the first and third with HU-CHAU
  FU and Sung-kiang fu. In favour of Vuju’s being Hu-chau is the
  fact mentioned by Wilson that the latter city is locally called
  WUCHU.[3] If this be the place, the Traveller does not seem to be
  following a direct and consecutive route from Su-chau to Hang-chau.
  Nor is Hu-chau within a day’s journey of Su-chau. Mr. Kingsmill
  observes that the only town at that distance is _Wukiang-hien_,
  once of some little importance but now much reduced. WUKIANG,
  however, is suggestive of VUGHIN; and, in that supposition,
  Hu-chau must be considered the object of a digression from which
  the Traveller returns and takes up his route to Hang-chau _viâ_
  Wukiang. _Kiahing_ would then best answer to _Ciangan_, or
  _Caingan_, as it is written in the following chapter of the G. T.

                            CHAPTER LXXVI.

     DESCRIPTION OF THE GREAT CITY OF KINSAY, WHICH IS THE CAPITAL
                    OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY OF MANZI.


When you have left the city of Changan and have travelled for three
days through a splendid country, passing a number of towns and
villages, you arrive at the most noble city of KINSAY, a name which is
as much as to say in our tongue “The City of Heaven,” as I told you
before.{1}

And since we have got thither I will enter into particulars about
its magnificence; and these are well worth the telling, for the city
is beyond dispute the finest and the noblest in the world. In this
we shall speak according to the written statement which the Queen of
this Realm sent to Bayan the conqueror of the country for transmission
to the Great Kaan, in order that he might be aware of the surpassing
grandeur of the city and might be moved to save it from destruction
or injury. I will tell you all the truth as it was set down in that
document. For truth it was, as the said Messer Marco Polo at a later
date was able to witness with his own eyes. And now we shall rehearse
those particulars.

First and foremost, then, the document stated the city of Kinsay to be
so great that it hath an hundred miles of compass. And there are in it
twelve thousand bridges of stone, for the most part so lofty that a
great fleet could pass beneath them. And let no man marvel that there
are so many bridges, for you see the whole city stands as it were in
the water and surrounded by water, so that a great many bridges are
required to give free passage about it. [And though the bridges be so
high the approaches are so well contrived that carts and horses do
cross them.{2}]

The document aforesaid also went on to state that there were in this
city twelve guilds of the different crafts, and that each guild had
12,000 houses in the occupation of its workmen. Each of these houses
contains at least 12 men, whilst some contain 20 and some 40,—not that
these are all masters, but inclusive of the journeymen who work under
the masters. And yet all these craftsmen had full occupation, for many
other cities of the kingdom are supplied from this city with what they
require.

The document aforesaid also stated that the number and wealth of the
merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands,
was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof. And
I should have told you with regard to those masters of the different
crafts who are at the head of such houses as I have mentioned, that
neither they nor their wives ever touch a piece of work with their
own hands, but live as nicely and delicately as if they were kings
and queens. The wives indeed are most dainty and angelical creatures!
Moreover it was an ordinance laid down by the King that every man
should follow his father’s business and no other, no matter if he
possessed 100,000 bezants.{3}

Inside the city there is a Lake which has a compass of some 30 miles:
and all round it are erected beautiful palaces and mansions, of the
richest and most exquisite structure that you can imagine, belonging to
the nobles of the city. There are also on its shores many abbeys and
churches of the Idolaters. In the middle of the Lake are two Islands,
on each of which stands a rich, beautiful and spacious edifice,
furnished in such style as to seem fit for the palace of an Emperor.
And when any one of the citizens desired to hold a marriage feast, or
to give any other entertainment, it used to be done at one of these
palaces. And everything would be found there ready to order, such
as silver plate, trenchers, and dishes [napkins and table-cloths],
and whatever else was needful. The King made this provision for the
gratification of his people, and the place was open to every one who
desired to give an entertainment. [Sometimes there would be at these
palaces an hundred different parties; some holding a banquet, others
celebrating a wedding; and yet all would find good accommodation in
the different apartments and pavilions, and that in so well ordered a
manner that one party was never in the way of another.{4}]

The houses of the city are provided with lofty towers of stone in which
articles of value are stored for fear of fire; for most of the houses
themselves are of timber, and fires are very frequent in the city.

The people are Idolaters; and since they were conquered by the Great
Kaan they use paper-money. [Both men and women are fair and comely,
and for the most part clothe themselves in silk, so vast is the supply
of that material, both from the whole district of Kinsay, and from the
imports by traders from other provinces.{5}] And you must know they eat
every kind of flesh, even that of dogs and other unclean beasts, which
nothing would induce a Christian to eat.

Since the Great Kaan occupied the city he has ordained that each of
the 12,000 bridges should be provided with a guard of ten men, in
case of any disturbance, or of any being so rash as to plot treason
or insurrection against him. [Each guard is provided with a hollow
instrument of wood and with a metal basin, and with a time-keeper to
enable them to know the hour of the day or night. And so when one hour
of the night is past the sentry strikes one on the wooden instrument
and on the basin, so that the whole quarter of the city is made aware
that one hour of the night is gone. At the second hour he gives two
strokes, and so on, keeping always wide awake and on the look out. In
the morning again, from the sunrise, they begin to count anew, and
strike one hour as they did in the night, and so on hour after hour.

Part of the watch patrols the quarter, to see if any light or fire is
burning after the lawful hours; if they find any they mark the door,
and in the morning the owner is summoned before the magistrates, and
unless he can plead a good excuse he is punished. Also if they find any
one going about the streets at unlawful hours they arrest him, and in
the morning they bring him before the magistrates. Likewise if in the
daytime they find any poor cripple unable to work for his livelihood,
they take him to one of the hospitals, of which there are many, founded
by the ancient kings, and endowed with great revenues.{6} Or if he be
capable of work they oblige him to take up some trade. If they see
that any house has caught fire they immediately beat upon that wooden
instrument to give the alarm, and this brings together the watchmen
from the other bridges to help to extinguish it, and to save the goods
of the merchants or others, either by removing them to the towers
above mentioned, or by putting them in boats and transporting them
to the islands in the lake. For no citizen dares leave his house at
night, or to come near the fire; only those who own the property, and
those watchmen who flock to help, of whom there shall come one or two
thousand at the least.]

Moreover, within the city there is an eminence on which stands a
Tower, and at the top of the tower is hung a slab of wood. Whenever
fire or any other alarm breaks out in the city a man who stands there
with a mallet in his hand beats upon the slab, making a noise that is
heard to a great distance. So when the blows upon this slab are heard,
everybody is aware that fire has broken out, or that there is some
other cause of alarm.

The Kaan watches this city with especial diligence because it forms
the head of all Manzi; and because he has an immense revenue from the
duties levied on the transactions of trade therein, the amount of which
is such that no one would credit it on mere hearsay.

All the streets of the city are paved with stone or brick, as indeed
are all the highways throughout Manzi, so that you ride and travel in
every direction without inconvenience. Were it not for this pavement
you could not do so, for the country is very low and flat, and after
rain ’tis deep in mire and water. [But as the Great Kaan’s couriers
could not gallop their horses over the pavement, the side of the road
is left unpaved for their convenience. The pavement of the main street
of the city also is laid out in two parallel ways of ten paces in width
on either side, leaving a space in the middle laid with fine gravel,
under which are vaulted drains which convey the rain water into the
canals; and thus the road is kept ever dry.]{7}

You must know also that the city of Kinsay has some 3000 baths, the
water of which is supplied by springs. They are hot baths, and the
people take great delight in them, frequenting them several times a
month, for they are very cleanly in their persons. They are the finest
and largest baths in the world; large enough for 100 persons to bathe
together.{8}

And the Ocean Sea comes within 25 miles of the city at a place called
GANFU, where there is a town and an excellent haven, with a vast
amount of shipping which is engaged in the traffic to and from India
and other foreign parts, exporting and importing many kinds of wares,
by which the city benefits. And a great river flows from the city of
Kinsay to that sea-haven, by which vessels can come up to the city
itself. This river extends also to other places further inland.{9}

Know also that the Great Kaan hath distributed the territory of Manzi
into nine parts, which he hath constituted into nine kingdoms. To each
of these kingdoms a king is appointed who is subordinate to the Great
Kaan, and every year renders the accounts of his kingdom to the fiscal
office at the capital.{10} This city of Kinsay is the seat of one of
these kings, who rules over 140 great and wealthy cities. For in the
whole of this vast country of Manzi there are more than 1200 great and
wealthy cities, without counting the towns and villages, which are
in great numbers. And you may receive it for certain that in each of
those 1200 cities the Great Kaan has a garrison, and that the smallest
of such garrisons musters 1000 men; whilst there are some of 10,000,
20,000 and 30,000; so that the total number of troops is something
scarcely calculable. The troops forming these garrisons are not all
Tartars. Many are from the province of Cathay, and good soldiers too.
But you must not suppose they are by any means all of them cavalry;
a very large proportion of them are foot-soldiers, according to the
special requirements of each city. And all of them belong to the army
of the Great Kaan.{11}

I repeat that everything appertaining to this city is on so vast a
scale, and the Great Kaan’s yearly revenues therefrom are so immense,
that it is not easy even to put it in writing, and it seems past belief
to one who merely hears it told. But I _will_ write it down for you.

First, however, I must mention another thing. The people of this
country have a custom, that as soon as a child is born they write
down the day and hour and the planet and sign under which its birth
has taken place; so that every one among them knows the day of his
birth. And when any one intends a journey he goes to the astrologers,
and gives the particulars of his nativity in order to learn whether
he shall have good luck or no. Sometimes they will say _no_, and in
that case the journey is put off till such day as the astrologer may
recommend. These astrologers are very skilful at their business, and
often their words come to pass, so the people have great faith in them.

They burn the bodies of the dead. And when any one dies the friends and
relations make a great mourning for the deceased, and clothe themselves
in hempen garments,{12} and follow the corpse playing on a variety
of instruments and singing hymns to their idols. And when they come
to the burning place, they take representations of things cut out of
parchment, such as caparisoned horses, male and female slaves, camels,
armour suits of cloth of gold (and money), in great quantities, and
these things they put on the fire along with the corpse, so that they
are all burnt with it. And they tell you that the dead man shall have
all these slaves and animals of which the effigies are burnt, alive in
flesh and blood, and the money in gold, at his disposal in the next
world; and that the instruments which they have caused to be played at
his funeral, and the idol hymns that have been chaunted, shall also be
produced again to welcome him in the next world; and that the idols
themselves will come to do him honour.{13}

Furthermore there exists in this city the palace of the king who
fled, him who was Emperor of Manzi, and that is the greatest palace
in the world, as I shall tell you more particularly. For you must
know its demesne hath a compass of ten miles, all enclosed with lofty
battlemented walls; and inside the walls are the finest and most
delectable gardens upon earth, and filled too with the finest fruits.
There are numerous fountains in it also, and lakes full of fish. In the
middle is the palace itself, a great and splendid building. It contains
20 great and handsome halls, one of which is more spacious than the
rest, and affords room for a vast multitude to dine. It is all painted
in gold, with many histories and representations of beasts and birds,
of knights and dames, and many marvellous things. It forms a really
magnificent spectacle, for over all the walls and all the ceiling you
see nothing but paintings in gold. And besides these halls the palace
contains 1000 large and handsome chambers, all painted in gold and
divers colours.

Moreover, I must tell you that in this city there are 160 _tomans_ of
fires, or in other words 160 _tomans_ of houses. Now I should tell
you that the _toman_ is 10,000, so that you can reckon the total
as altogether 1,600,000 houses, among which are a great number of
rich palaces. There is one church only, belonging to the Nestorian
Christians.

There is another thing I must tell you. It is the custom for every
burgess of this city, and in fact for every description of person in
it, to write over his door his own name, the name of his wife, and
those of his children, his slaves, and all the inmates of his house,
and also the number of animals that he keeps. And if any one dies in
the house then the name of that person is erased, and if any child is
born its name is added. So in this way the sovereign is able to know
exactly the population of the city. And this is the practice also
throughout all Manzi and Cathay.{14}

     sans faille la plus noble cité et la
     meillor qe soit au monde.”]

And I must tell you that every hosteler who keeps an hostel for
travellers is bound to register their names and surnames, as well
as the day and month of their arrival and departure. And thus the
sovereign hath the means of knowing, whenever it pleases him, who come
and go throughout his dominions. And certes this is a wise order and a
provident.


  NOTE 1.—KINSAY represents closely enough the Chinese term
  _King-sze_, “capital,” which was then applied to the great city,
  the proper name of which was at that time Lin-ngan and is now
  HANG-CHAU, as being since 1127 the capital of the Sung Dynasty.
  The same term _King-sze_ is now on Chinese maps generally used to
  designate Peking. It would seem, however, that the term adhered
  long as a quasi-proper name to Hang-chau; for in the Chinese Atlas,
  dating from 1595, which the traveller Carletti presented to the
  Magliabecchian Library, that city appears to be still marked with
  this name, transcribed by Carletti as _Camse_; very near the form
  _Campsay_ used by Marignolli in the 14th century.

  [Illustration: The ancient Lun-ho-ta Pagoda at Hang-chau.]

  NOTE 2.—✛The Ramusian version says: “Messer Marco Polo was
  frequently at this city, and took great pains to learn everything
  about it, writing down the whole in his notes.” The information
  being originally derived from a Chinese document, there might be
  some ground for supposing that 100 miles of circuit stood for
  100 _li_. Yet the circuit of the modern city is stated in the
  official book called _Hang-chau Fu-Chi_, or topographical history
  of Hang-chau, at only 35 _li_. And the earliest record of the
  wall, as built under the Sui by Yang-su (before A.D. 606), makes
  its extent little more (36 _li_ and 90 paces.)[1] But the wall
  was reconstructed by Ts’ien Kiao, feudal prince of the region,
  during the reign of Chao Tsung, one of the last emperors of the
  T’ang Dynasty (892), so as to embrace the Luh-ho-ta Pagoda, on a
  high bluff over the Tsien-tang River,[2] 15 _li_ distant from the
  present south gate, and had then a circuit of 70 _li_. Moreover, in
  1159, after the city became the capital of the Sung emperors, some
  further extension was given to it, so that, even exclusive of the
  suburbs, the circuit of the city may have been not far short of 100
  _li_. When the city was in its glory under the Sung, the Luh-ho-ta
  Pagoda may be taken as marking the extreme S.W. Another known point
  marks approximately the chief north gate of that period, at a mile
  and a half or two miles beyond the present north wall. The S.E.
  angle was apparently near the river bank. But, on the other hand,
  the _waist_ of the city seems to have been a good deal narrower
  than it now is. Old descriptions compare its form to that of a
  slender-waisted drum (dice-box or hour-glass shape).

  Under the Mongols the walls were allowed to decay; and in the
  disturbed years that closed that dynasty (1341–1368) they were
  rebuilt by an insurgent chief on a greatly reduced compass,
  probably that which they still retain. Whatever may have been the
  facts, and whatever the origin of the estimate, I imagine that the
  ascription of 100 miles of circuit to Kinsay had become popular
  among Westerns. Odoric makes the same statement. Wassáf calls it
  24 parasangs, which will not be far short of the same amount.
  Ibn Batuta calls the _length_ of the city three days’ journey.
  Rashiduddin says the enceinte had a _diameter_ of 11 parasangs,
  and that there were three post stages between the two extremities
  of the city, which is probably what Ibn Batuta had heard. The
  _Masálak-al-Absár_ calls it _one_ day’s journey in length, and half
  a day’s journey in breadth. The enthusiastic Jesuit Martini tries
  hard to justify Polo in this as in other points of his description.
  We shall quote the whole of his remarks at the end of the chapters
  on Kinsay.

  [Dr. F. Hirth, in a paper published in the _T’oung Pao_, V. pp.
  386–390 (_Ueber den Schiffsverkehr von Kinsay zu Marco Polo’s
  Zeit_), has some interesting notes on the maritime trade of
  Hang-chau, collected from a work in twenty books, kept at the
  Berlin Royal Library, in which is to be found a description of
  Hang-chau under the title of _Mêng-liang-lu_, published in 1274
  by Wu Tzu-mu, himself a native of this city: there are various
  classes of sea-going vessels; large boats measuring 5000 _liao_
  and carrying from five to six hundred passengers; smaller boats
  measuring from 2 to 1000 _liao_ and carrying from two to three
  hundred passengers; there are small fast boats called _tsuan-fêng_,
  “wind breaker,” with six or eight oarsmen, which can carry easily
  100 passengers, and are generally used for fishing; sampans are not
  taken into account. To start for foreign countries one must embark
  at Ts’wan-chau, and then go to the sea of Ts’i-chau (Paracels),
  through the Tai-hsü pass; coming back he must look to Kwen-lun
  (Pulo Condor).—H. C.]

  The 12,000 bridges have been much carped at, and modern accounts
  of Hang-chau (desperately meagre as they are) do not speak of
  its bridges as notable. “There is, indeed,” says Mr. Kingsmill,
  speaking of changes in the hydrography about Hang-chau, “no trace
  in the city of the magnificent canals and bridges described by
  Marco Polo.” The number was no doubt in this case also a mere
  popular saw, and Friar Odoric repeats it. The sober and veracious
  John Marignolli, alluding apparently to their statements, and
  perhaps to others which have not reached us, says: “When authors
  tell of its ten thousand noble bridges of stone, adorned with
  sculptures and statues of armed princes, it passes the belief of
  one who has not been there, and yet peradventure these authors tell
  us no lie.” Wassáf speaks of 360 bridges only, but they make up in
  size what they lack in number, for they cross canals as big as the
  Tigris! Marsden aptly quotes in reference to this point excessively
  loose and discrepant statements from modern authors as to the
  number of bridges in Venice. The great _height_ of the arches of
  the canal bridges in this part of China is especially noticed by
  travellers. Barrow, quoted by Marsden, says: “Some have the piers
  of such an extraordinary height that the largest vessels of 200
  tons sail under them without striking their masts.”

  Mr. Moule has added up the lists of bridges in the whole department
  (or _Fu_) and found them to amount to 848, and many of these even
  are now unknown, their approximate sites being given from ancient
  topographies. The number _represented_ in a large modern map of the
  city, which I owe to Mr. Moule’s kindness, is 111.

  NOTE 3.—Though Rubruquis (p. 292) says much the same thing,
  there is little trace of such an ordinance in modern China. Père
  Parrenin observes: “As to the hereditary perpetuation of trades,
  it has never existed in China. On the contrary, very few Chinese
  will learn the trade of their fathers; and it is only necessity
  that ever constrains them to do so.” (_Lett. Edif._ XXIV. 40.)
  Mr. Moule remarks, however, that P. Parrenin is a little too
  absolute. Certain trades do run in families, even of the free
  classes of Chinese, not to mention the disfranchised boatmen,
  barbers, chair-coolies, etc. But, except in the latter cases, there
  is no compulsion, though the Sacred Edict goes to encourage the
  perpetuation of the family calling.

  NOTE 4.—This sheet of water is the celebrated SI-HU, or “Western
  Lake,” the fame of which had reached Abulfeda, and which has
  raised the enthusiasm even of modern travellers, such as Barrow
  and Van Braam. The latter speaks of _three_ islands (and this the
  Chinese maps confirm), on each of which were several villas, and
  of causeways across the lake, paved and bordered with trees, and
  provided with numerous bridges for the passage of boats. Barrow
  gives a bright description of the lake, with its thousands of gay,
  gilt, and painted pleasure boats, its margins studded with light
  and fanciful buildings, its gardens of choice flowering shrubs, its
  monuments, and beautiful variety of scenery. None surpasses that of
  Martini, whom it is always pleasant to quote, but here he is too
  lengthy. The most recent description that I have met with is that
  of Mr. C. Gardner, and it is as enthusiastic as any. It concludes:
  “Even to us foreigners ... the spot is one of peculiar attraction,
  but to the Chinese it is as a paradise.” The Emperor K’ien Lung had
  erected a palace on one of the islands in the lake; it was ruined
  by the T’ai-P’ings. Many of the constructions about the lake date
  from the flourishing days of the T’ang Dynasty, the 7th and 8th
  centuries.

  Polo’s ascription of a circumference of 30 miles to the lake,
  corroborates the supposition that in the compass of the city a
  confusion had been made between miles and _li_, for Semedo gives
  the circuit of the lake really as 30 _li_. Probably the document to
  which Marco refers at the beginning of the chapter was seen by him
  in a Persian translation, in which _li_ had been rendered by _míl_.
  A Persian work of the same age, quoted by Quatremère (the _Nuzhát
  al-Ḳulúb_), gives the circuit of the lake as six parasangs, or some
  24 miles, a statement which probably had a like origin.

  Polo says the lake was _within_ the city. This might be merely a
  loose way of speaking, but it may on the other hand be a further
  indication of the former existence of an extensive outer wall. The
  Persian author just quoted also speaks of the lake as within the
  city. (_Barrow’s Autobiog._, p. 104; _V. Braam_, II. 154; _Gardner_
  in _Proc. of the R. Geog. Soc._, vol. xiii. p. 178; _Q. Rashid_,
  p. lxxxviii.) Mr. Moule states that popular oral tradition does
  enclose the lake within the walls, but he can find no trace of this
  in the Topographies.

  Elsewhere Mr. Moule says: “Of the luxury of the (Sung) period, and
  its devotion to pleasure, evidence occurs everywhere. Hang-chow
  went at the time by the nickname of the melting-pot for money.
  The use, at houses of entertainment, of _linen and silver plate_
  appears somewhat out of keeping in a Chinese picture. I cannot
  vouch for the linen, but here is the plate.... ‘The most famous
  Tea-houses of the day were the _Pa-seen_ (“8 genii”), the “Pure
  Delight,” the “Pearl,” the “House of the Pwan Family,” and the
  “Two and Two” and “Three and Three” houses (perhaps rather “Double
  honours” and “Treble honours”). In these places they always set
  out bouquets of fresh flowers, according to the season.... At
  the counter were sold “Precious thunder Tea,” Tea of fritters
  and onions, or else Pickle broth; and in hot weather wine of
  snow bubbles and apricot blossom, or other kinds of refrigerating
  liquor. _Saucers, ladles, and bowls were all of pure, silver_!’
  (_Si-Hu-Chi_.)”

  NOTE 5.—This is still the case: “The people of Hang-chow dress
  gaily, and are remarkable among the Chinese for their dandyism.
  All, except the lowest labourers and coolies, strutted about in
  dresses composed of silk, satin, and crape.... ‘Indeed’ (said the
  Chinese servants) ‘one can never tell a rich man in Hang-chow, for
  it is just possible that all he possesses in the world is on his
  back.’” (_Fortune_, II. 20.) “The silk manufactures of Hang-chau
  are said to give employment to 60,000 persons within the city
  walls, and Hu-chau, Kia-hing, and the surrounding villages, are
  reputed to employ 100,000 more.” (_Ningpo Trade Report_, January
  1869, comm. by Mr. N. B. Dennys.) The store-towers, as a precaution
  in case of fire, are still common both in China and Japan.

  NOTE 6.—Mr. Gardner found in this very city, in 1868, a large
  collection of cottages covering several acres, which were
  “erected, after the taking of the city from the rebels, by a
  Chinese charitable society for the refuge of the blind, sick, and
  infirm.” This asylum sheltered 200 blind men with their families,
  amounting to 800 souls; basket-making and such work was provided
  for them; there were also 1200 other inmates, aged and infirm; and
  doctors were maintained to look after them. “None are allowed to
  be absolutely idle, but all help towards their own sustenance.”
  (_Proc. R. G. Soc._ XIII. 176–177.) Mr. Moule, whilst abating
  somewhat from the colouring of this description, admits the
  establishment to be a considerable charitable effort. It existed
  before the rebellion, as I see in the book of Mr. Milne, who gives
  interesting details on such Chinese charities. (_Life in China_,
  pp. 46 _seqq._)

  NOTE 7.—The paved roads of Manzi are by no means extinct yet. Thus,
  Mr. Fortune, starting from Chang-shan (see below, ch. lxxix.) in
  the direction of the Black-Tea mountains, says: “The road on which
  we were travelling was well paved with granite, about 12 feet in
  width, and perfectly free from weeds.” (II. 148). Garnier, Sladen,
  and Richthofen speak of well-paved roads in Yun-Nan and Sze-ch’wan.

  The Topography quoted by Mr. Moule says that in the year 1272
  the Governor renewed the pavement of the Imperial road (or Main
  Street), “after which nine cars might move abreast over a way
  perfectly smooth, and straight as an arrow.” In the Mongol time the
  people were allowed to encroach on this grand street.

  NOTE 8.—There is a curious discrepancy in the account of these
  baths. Pauthier’s text does not say whether they are hot baths
  or cold. The latter sentence, beginning, “They are hot baths”
  (_estuves_), is from the G. Text. And Ramusio’s account is quite
  different: “There are numerous baths of cold water, provided with
  plenty of attendants, male and female, to assist the visitors of
  the two sexes in the bath. For the people are used from their
  childhood to bathe in cold water at all seasons, and they reckon
  it a very wholesome custom. But in the bath-houses they have also
  certain chambers furnished with hot water, for foreigners who are
  unaccustomed to cold bathing, and cannot bear it. The people are
  used to bathe daily, and do not eat without having done so.” This
  is in contradiction with the notorious Chinese horror of cold water
  for any purpose.

  A note from Mr. C. Gardner says: “There are numerous public baths
  at Hang-chau, as at every Chinese city I have ever been in. In my
  experience natives always take _hot_ baths. But only the poorer
  classes go to the public baths; the tradespeople and middle classes
  are generally supplied by the bath-houses with hot water at a
  moderate charge.”

  NOTE 9.—The estuary of the Ts’ien T’ang, or river of Hang-chau,
  has undergone great changes since Polo’s day. The sea now comes up
  much nearer the city; and the upper part of the Bay of Hang-chau is
  believed to cover what was once the site of the port and town of
  KANP’U, the Ganpu of the text. A modern representative of the name
  still subsists, a walled town, and one of the depôts for the salt
  which is so extensively manufactured on this coast; but the present
  port of Hang-chau, and till recently the sole seat of Chinese
  trade with Japan, is at _Chapu_, some 20 miles further seaward.

  It is supposed by Klaproth that KANP’U was the port frequented by
  the early Arab voyagers, and of which they speak under the name of
  _Khánfú_, confounding in their details Hang-chau itself with the
  port. Neumann dissents from this, maintaining that the Khanfu of
  the Arabs was certainly Canton. Abulfeda, however, states expressly
  that Khanfu was known in his day as _Khansá_ (_i.e._ Kinsay),
  and he speaks of its lake of fresh water called _Sikhu_ (Si-hu).
  [Abulfeda has in fact two Khânqû (Khanfû): Khansâ with the lake
  which is Kinsay, and one Khanfû which is probably Canton. (See
  _Guyard’s transl._, II., ii., 122–124.)—H. C.] There seems to be an
  indication in Chinese records that a southern branch of the Great
  Kiang once entered the sea at Kanp’u; the closing of it is assigned
  to the 7th century, or a little later.

  [Dr. F. Hirth writes (_Jour. Roy. As. Soc._, 1896, pp. 68–69): “For
  centuries Canton must have been the only channel through which
  foreign trade was permitted; for it is not before the year 999 that
  we read of the appointment of Inspectors of Trade at Hang-chou
  and Ming-chou. The latter name is identified with Ning-po.” Dr.
  Hirth adds in a note: “This is in my opinion the principal reason
  why the port of _Khanfu_, mentioned by the earliest Muhammadan
  travellers, or authors (Soleiman, Abu Zeid, and Maçoudi), cannot
  be identified with Hang-chou. The report of Soleiman, who first
  speaks of _Khanfu_, was written in 851, and in those days Canton
  was apparently the only port open to foreign trade. Marco Polo’s
  _Ganfu_ is a different port altogether, viz. _Kan-fu_, or _Kan-pu_,
  near Hang-chou, and should not be confounded with _Khanfu_.”—H. C.]

  The changes of the Great Kiang do not seem to have attracted
  so much attention among the Chinese as those of the dangerous
  Hwang-Ho, nor does their history seem to have been so carefully
  recorded. But a paper of great interest on the subject was
  published by Mr. Edkins, in the _Journal of the North China Branch
  of the R. A. S._ for September 1860 [pp. 77–84], which I know only
  by an abstract given by the late Comte d’Escayrac de Lauture. From
  this it would seem that about the time of our era the Yang-tzŭ
  Kiang had three great mouths. The most southerly of these was the
  Che-Kiang, which is said to have given its name to the Province
  still so called, of which Hang-chau is the capital. This branch
  quitted the present channel at Chi-chau, passed by Ning-Kwé and
  Kwang-té, communicating with the southern end of a great group
  of lakes which occupied the position of the T’ai-Hu, and so by
  Shih-men and T’ang-si into the sea not far from Shao-hing. The
  second branch quitted the main channel at Wu-hu, passed by I-hing
  (or I-shin) communicating with the northern end of the T’ai-Hu
  (passed apparently by Su-chau), and then bifurcated, one arm
  entering the sea at Wu-sung, and the other at Kanp’u. The third,
  or northerly branch is that which forms the present channel of the
  Great Kiang. These branches are represented hypothetically on the
  sketch-map attached to ch. lxiv. _supra_.

  N. Ch. Br. R. A. S._, December 1865, p. 3 _seqq._; _Escayrac de
  Lauture, Mém. sur la Chine, H. du Sol_, p. 114.)

  NOTE 10.—Pauthier’s text has: “_Chascun Roy fait chascun an le
  compte de son royaume aux comptes du grant siège_,” where I suspect
  the last word is again a mistake for _sing_ or _scieng_. (See
  _supra_, Bk. II. ch. xxv., note 1.) It is interesting to find
  Polo applying the term _king_ to the viceroys who ruled the great
  provinces; Ibn Batuta uses a corresponding expression, _sultán_.
  It is not easy to make out the nine kingdoms or great provinces
  into which Polo considered Manzi to be divided. Perhaps his _nine_
  is after all merely a traditional number, for the “Nine Provinces”
  was an ancient synonym for China proper, just as _Nau-Khanda_,
  with like meaning, was an ancient name of India. (See _Cathay_, p.
  cxxxix. _note_; and _Reinaud, Inde_, p. 116.) But I observe that
  on the portage road between Chang-shan and Yuh-shan (_infra_, p.
  222) there are stone pillars inscribed “Highway (from Che-kiang) to
  Eight Provinces,” thus indicating Nine. (_Milne_, p. 319.)

  NOTE 11.—We have in Ramusio: “The men levied in the province of
  Manzi are not placed in garrison in their own cities, but sent to
  others at least 20 days’ journey from their homes; and there they
  serve for four or five years, after which they are relieved. This
  applies both to the Cathayans and to those of Manzi.

  “The great bulk of the revenue of the cities, which enters the
  exchequer of the Great Kaan, is expended in maintaining these
  garrisons. And if perchance any city rebel (as you often find
  that under a kind of madness or intoxication they rise and murder
  their governors), as soon as it is known, the adjoining cities
  despatch such large forces from their garrisons that the rebellion
  is entirely crushed. For it would be too long an affair if troops
  from Cathay had to be waited for, involving perhaps a delay of two
  months.”

  NOTE 12.—“The sons of the dead, wearing hempen clothes as badges of
  mourning, kneel down,” etc. (_Doolittle_, p. 138.)

  NOTE 13.—These practices have been noticed, _supra_, Bk. I. ch. xl.

  NOTE 14.—This custom has come down to modern times. In Pauthier’s
  _Chine Moderne_, we find extracts from the statutes of the reigning
  dynasty and the comments thereon, of which a passage runs thus: “To
  determine the exact population of each province the governor and
  the lieutenant-governor cause certain persons who are nominated
  as _Pao-kia_, or Tithing-Men, in all the places under their
  jurisdiction, to add up the figures inscribed on the wooden tickets
  attached to the doors of houses, and exhibiting the number of the
  inmates” (p. 167).

  Friar Odoric calls the number of fires 89 _tomans_; but says 10 or
  12 households would unite to have one fire only!


----------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] In the first edition, my best authority on this matter was a
    lecture on the city by the late Rev. D. D. Green, an American
    Missionary at Ningpo, which is printed in the November and
    December numbers for 1869 of the (Fuchau) _Chinese Recorder and
    Missionary Journal_. In the present (second) edition I have on
    this, and other points embraced in this and the following chapters,
    benefited largely by the remarks of the Right Rev. G. E. Moule
    of the Ch. Mission. Soc., now residing at Hang-chau. These are
    partly contained in a paper (_Notes on Colonel Yule’s Edition of
    Marco Polo’s ‘Quinsay’_) read before the North China Branch of
    the R. A. Soc. at Shang-hai in December 1873 [published in New
    Series, No. IX. of the _Journal N. C. B. R. A. Soc._], of which
    a proof has been most kindly sent to me by Mr. Moule, and partly
    in a special communication, both forwarded through Mr. A. Wylie.
    [See also _Notes on Hangchow Past and Present_, a paper read in
    1889 by Bishop G. E. Moule at a Meeting of the Hangchau Missionary
    Association, at whose request it was compiled, and subsequently

                            CHAPTER LXXVII.

     [FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE GREAT CITY OF KINSAY.{1}]


[The position of the city is such that it has on one side a lake of
fresh and exquisitely clear water (already spoken of), and on the other
a very large river. The waters of the latter fill a number of canals of
all sizes which run through the different quarters of the city, carry
away all impurities, and then enter the Lake; whence they issue again
and flow to the Ocean, thus producing a most excellent atmosphere. By
means of these channels, as well as by the streets, you can go all
about the city. Both streets and canals are so wide and spacious that
carts on the one and boats on the other can readily pass to and fro,
conveying necessary supplies to the inhabitants.{2}

At the opposite side the city is shut in by a channel, perhaps 40
miles in length, very wide, and full of water derived from the river
aforesaid, which was made by the ancient kings of the country in order
to relieve the river when flooding its banks. This serves also as a
defence to the city, and the earth dug from it has been thrown inwards,
forming a kind of mound enclosing the city.{3}

In this part are the ten principal markets, though besides these there
are a vast number of others in the different parts of the town. The
former are all squares of half a mile to the side, and along their
front passes the main street, which is 40 paces in width, and runs
straight from end to end of the city, crossing many bridges of easy
and commodious approach. At every four miles of its length comes one
of those great squares of 2 miles (as we have mentioned) in compass.
So also parallel to this great street, but at the back of the market
places, there runs a very large canal, on the bank of which towards
the squares are built great houses of stone, in which the merchants
from India and other foreign parts store their wares, to be handy for
the markets. In each of the squares is held a market three days in
the week, frequented by 40,000 or 50,000 persons, who bring thither
for sale every possible necessary of life, so that there is always an
ample supply of every kind of meat and game, as of roebuck, red-deer,
fallow-deer, hares, rabbits, partridges, pheasants, francolins, quails,
fowls, capons, and of ducks and geese an infinite quantity; for so many
are bred on the Lake that for a Venice groat of silver you can have a
couple of geese and two couple of ducks. Then there are the shambles
where the larger animals are slaughtered, such as calves, beeves, kids,
and lambs, the flesh of which is eaten by the rich and the great
dignitaries.{4}

Those markets make a daily display of every kind of vegetables and
fruits; and among the latter there are in particular certain pears of
enormous size, weighing as much as ten pounds apiece, and the pulp of
which is white and fragrant like a confection; besides peaches in their
season both yellow and white, of every delicate flavour.{5}

Neither grapes nor wine are produced there, but very good raisins are
brought from abroad, and wine likewise. The natives, however, do not
much care about wine, being used to that kind of their own made from
rice and spices. From the Ocean Sea also come daily supplies of fish in
great quantity, brought 25 miles up the river, and there is also great
store of fish from the lake, which is the constant resort of fishermen,
who have no other business. Their fish is of sundry kinds, changing
with the season; and, owing to the impurities of the city which pass
into the lake, it is remarkably fat and savoury. Any one who should
see the supply of fish in the market would suppose it impossible that
such a quantity could ever be sold; and yet in a few hours the whole
shall be cleared away; so great is the number of inhabitants who are
accustomed to delicate living. Indeed they eat fish and flesh at the
same meal.

All the ten market places are encompassed by lofty houses, and below
these are shops where all sorts of crafts are carried on, and all sorts
of wares are on sale, including spices and jewels and pearls. Some of
these shops are entirely devoted to the sale of wine made from rice
and spices, which is constantly made fresh and fresh, and is sold very
cheap.

Certain of the streets are occupied by the women of the town, who are
in such a number that I dare not say what it is. They are found not
only in the vicinity of the market places, where usually a quarter
is assigned to them, but all over the city. They exhibit themselves
splendidly attired and abundantly perfumed, in finely garnished houses,
with trains of waiting-women. These women are extremely accomplished
in all the arts of allurement, and readily adapt their conversation
to all sorts of persons, insomuch that strangers who have once tasted
their attractions seem to get bewitched, and are so taken with their
blandishments and their fascinating ways that they never can get these
out of their heads. Hence it comes to pass that when they return home
they say they have been to Kinsay or the City of Heaven, and their only
desire is to get back thither as soon as possible.{6}

Other streets are occupied by the Physicians, and by the Astrologers,
who are also teachers of reading and writing; and an infinity of other
professions have their places round about those squares. In each of the
squares there are two great palaces facing one another, in which are
established the officers appointed by the King to decide differences
arising between merchants, or other inhabitants of the quarter. It
is the daily duty of these officers to see that the guards are at
their posts on the neighbouring bridges, and to punish them at their
discretion if they are absent.

All along the main street that we have spoken of, as running from end
to end of the city, both sides are lined with houses and great palaces
and the gardens pertaining to them, whilst in the intervals are the
houses of tradesmen engaged in their different crafts. The crowd of
people that you meet here at all hours, passing this way and that
on their different errands, is so vast that no one would believe it
possible that victuals enough could be provided for their consumption,
unless they should see how, on every market-day, all those squares are
thronged and crammed with purchasers, and with the traders who have
brought in stores of provisions by land or water; and everything they
bring in is disposed of.

To give you an example of the vast consumption in this city let us
take the article of _pepper_; and that will enable you in some measure
to estimate what must be the quantity of victual, such as meat, wine,
groceries, which have to be provided for the general consumption. Now
Messer Marco heard it stated by one of the Great Kaan’s officers of
customs that the quantity of pepper introduced daily for consumption
into the city of Kinsay amounted to 43 loads, each load being equal to
223 lbs.{7}

The houses of the citizens are well built and elaborately finished; and
the delight they take in decoration, in painting and in architecture,
leads them to spend in this way sums of money that would astonish you.

The natives of the city are men of peaceful character, both from
education and from the example of their kings, whose disposition was
the same. They know nothing of handling arms, and keep none in their
houses. You hear of no feuds or noisy quarrels or dissensions of
any kind among them. Both in their commercial dealings and in their
manufactures they are thoroughly honest and truthful, and there is such
a degree of good will and neighbourly attachment among both men and
women that you would take the people who live in the same street to be
all one family.{8}

And this familiar intimacy is free from all jealousy or suspicion of
the conduct of their women. These they treat with the greatest respect,
and a man who should presume to make loose proposals to a married woman
would be regarded as an infamous rascal. They also treat the foreigners
who visit them for the sake of trade with great cordiality, and
entertain them in the most winning manner, affording them every help
and advice on their business. But on the other hand they hate to see
soldiers, and not least those of the Great Kaan’s garrisons, regarding
them as the cause of their having lost their native kings and lords.

On the Lake of which we have spoken there are numbers of boats and
barges of all sizes for parties of pleasure. These will hold 10, 15,
20, or more persons, and are from 15 to 20 paces in length, with flat
bottoms and ample breadth of beam, so that they always keep their
trim. Any one who desires to go a-pleasuring with the women, or with a
party of his own sex, hires one of these barges, which are always to
be found completely furnished with tables and chairs and all the other
apparatus for a feast. The roof forms a level deck, on which the crew
stand, and pole the boat along whithersoever may be desired, for the
Lake is not more than 2 paces in depth. The inside of this roof and
the rest of the interior is covered with ornamental painting in gay
colours, with windows all round that can be shut or opened, so that the
party at table can enjoy all the beauty and variety of the prospects
on both sides as they pass along. And truly a trip on this Lake is a
much more charming recreation than can be enjoyed on land. For on the
one side lies the city in its entire length, so that the spectators
in the barges, from the distance at which they stand, take in the
whole prospect in its full beauty and grandeur, with its numberless
palaces, temples, monasteries, and gardens, full of lofty trees,
sloping to the shore. And the Lake is never without a number of other
such boats, laden with pleasure parties; for it is the great delight
of the citizens here, after they have disposed of the day’s business,
to pass the afternoon in enjoyment with the ladies of their families,
or perhaps with others less reputable, either in these barges or in
driving about the city in carriages.{9}

Of these latter we must also say something, for they afford one mode
of recreation to the citizens in going about the town, as the boats
afford another in going about the Lake. In the main street of the city
you meet an infinite succession of these carriages passing to and fro.
They are long covered vehicles, fitted with curtains and cushions,
and affording room for six persons; and they are in constant request
for ladies and gentlemen going on parties of pleasure. In these they
drive to certain gardens, where they are entertained by the owners in
pavilions erected on purpose, and there they divert themselves the
livelong day, with their ladies, returning home in the evening in those
same carriages.{10}

        (FURTHER PARTICULARS OF THE PALACE OF THE KING FACFUR.)

The whole enclosure of the Palace was divided into three parts. The
middle one was entered by a very lofty gate, on each side of which
there stood on the ground-level vast pavilions, the roofs of which were
sustained by columns painted and wrought in gold and the finest azure.
Opposite the gate stood the chief Pavilion, larger than the rest, and
painted in like style, with gilded columns, and a ceiling wrought in
splendid gilded sculpture, whilst the walls were artfully painted with
the stories of departed kings.

On certain days, sacred to his gods, the King Facfur[1] used to hold
a great court and give a feast to his chief lords, dignitaries, and
rich manufacturers of the city of Kinsay. On such occasions those
pavilions used to give ample accommodation for 10,000 persons sitting
at table. This court lasted for ten or twelve days, and exhibited an
astonishing and incredible spectacle in the magnificence of the guests,
all clothed in silk and gold, with a profusion of precious stones; for
they tried to outdo each other in the splendour and richness of their
appointments. Behind this great Pavilion that faced the great gate,
there was a wall with a passage in it shutting off the inner part of
the Palace. On entering this you found another great edifice in the
form of a cloister surrounded by a portico with columns, from which
opened a variety of apartments for the King and the Queen, adorned
like the outer walls with such elaborate work as we have mentioned.
From the cloister again you passed into a covered corridor, six paces
in width, of great length, and extending to the margin of the lake. On
either side of this corridor were ten courts, in the form of oblong
cloisters surrounded by colonnades; and in each cloister or court were
fifty chambers with gardens to each. In these chambers were quartered
one thousand young ladies in the service of the King. The King would
sometimes go with the Queen and some of these maidens to take his
diversion on the Lake, or to visit the Idol-temples, in boats all
canopied with silk.

The other two parts of the enclosure were distributed in groves, and
lakes, and charming gardens planted with fruit-trees, and preserves for
all sorts of animals, such as roe, red-deer, fallow-deer, hares, and
rabbits. Here the King used to take his pleasure in company with those
damsels of his; some in carriages, some on horseback, whilst no man was
permitted to enter. Sometimes the King would set the girls a-coursing
after the game with dogs, and when they were tired they would hie to
the groves that overhung the lakes, and leaving their clothes there
they would come forth naked and enter the water and swim about hither
and thither, whilst it was the King’s delight to watch them; and then
all would return home. Sometimes the King would have his dinner carried
to those groves, which were dense with lofty trees, and there would be
waited on by those young ladies. And thus he passed his life in this
constant dalliance with women, without so much as knowing what _arms_
meant! And the result of all this cowardice and effeminacy was that he
lost his dominion to the Great Kaan in that base and shameful way that
you have heard.{11}

All this account was given me by a very rich merchant of Kinsay when
I was in that city. He was a very old man, and had been in familiar
intimacy with the King Facfur, and knew the whole history of his life;
and having seen the Palace in its glory was pleased to be my guide
over it. As it is occupied by the King appointed by the Great Kaan,
the first pavilions are still maintained as they used to be, but the
apartments of the ladies are all gone to ruin and can only just be
traced. So also the wall that enclosed the groves and gardens is fallen
down, and neither trees nor animals are there any longer.{12}]


  NOTE 1.—I have, after some consideration, followed the example
  of Mr. H. Murray, in his edition of _Marco Polo_, in collecting
  together in a separate chapter a number of additional particulars
  concerning the Great City, which are only found in Ramusio. Such
  of these as could be interpolated in the text of the older form of
  the narrative have been introduced between brackets in the last
  chapter. Here I bring together those particulars which could not be
  so interpolated without taking liberties with one or both texts.

  The picture in Ramusio, taken as a whole, is so much more
  brilliant, interesting, and complete than in the older texts, that
  I thought of substituting it entirely for the other. But so much
  doubt and difficulty hangs over _some_ passages of the Ramusian
  version that I could not satisfy myself of the propriety of this,
  though I feel that the dismemberment inflicted on that version is
  also objectionable.

  NOTE 2.—The tides in the Hang-chau estuary are now so furious,
  entering in the form of a bore, and running sometimes, by Admiral
  Collinson’s measurement, 11½ knots, that it has been necessary to
  close by weirs the communication which formerly existed between
  the River Tsien-tang on the one side and the Lake Si-hu and
  internal waters of the district on the other. Thus all cargoes are
  passed through the small city canal in barges, and are subject to
  transhipment at the river-bank, and at the great canal terminus
  outside the north gate, respectively. Mr. Kingsmill, to whose
  notices I am indebted for part of this information, is, however,
  mistaken in supposing that in Polo’s time the tide stopped some
  20 miles below the city. We have seen (note 6, ch. lxv. _supra_)
  that the tide in the river before Kinsay was the object which first
  attracted the attention of Bayan, after his triumphant entrance
  into the city. The tides reach Fuyang, 20 miles higher. (_N. and
  Q., China and Japan_, vol. I. p. 53; _Mid. Kingd._ I. 95, 106; _J.
  N. Ch. Br. R. A. S._, December, 1865, p. 6; _Milne_, p. 295; _Note_
  by _Mr. Moule_).

  [Miss E. Scidmore writes (_China_, p. 294): “There are only
  three wonders of the world in China—The Demons at Tungchow, the
  Thunder at Lungchow, and the Great Tide at Hangchow, the last,
  the greatest of all, and a living wonder to this day of ‘the open
  door,’ while its rivals are lost in myth and oblivion.... The Great
  Bore charges up the narrowing river at a speed of ten and thirteen
  miles an hour, with a roar that can be heard for an hour before it
  arrives.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—For satisfactory elucidation as to what is or may have been
  authentic in these statements, we shall have to wait for a correct
  survey of Hang-chau and its neighbourhood. We have already seen
  strong reason to suppose that _miles_ have been substituted for
  _li_ in the circuits assigned both to the city and to the lake, and
  we are yet more strongly impressed with the conviction that the
  same substitution has been made here in regard to the canal on the
  east of the city, as well as the streets and market-places spoken
  of in the next paragraph.

  Chinese plans of Hang-chau do show a large canal encircling the
  city on the east and north, _i.e._, on the sides away from the
  lake. In some of them this is represented like a ditch to the
  rampart, but in others it is more detached. And the position of
  the main street, with its parallel canal, does answer fairly to
  the account in the next paragraph, setting aside the extravagant
  dimensions.

  The existence of the squares or market-places is alluded to
  by Wassáf in a passage that we shall quote below; and the
  _Masálak-al-Absár_ speaks of the main street running from end to
  end of the city.

  On this Mr. Moule says: “I have found no certain account of
  market-squares, though the _Fang_,[2] of which a few still exist,
  and a very large number are laid down in the Sung Map, mainly
  grouped along the chief street, may perhaps represent them.... The
  names of some of these (_Fang_) and of the _Sze_ or markets still
  remain.”

  in the footnote; it is worth while to append them, at least in
  _diagram_.

  one another, in which were established the officers who decided
  differences between merchants, etc.

  The double lines represent streets, and the ‡ are gates.

  NOTE 4.—There is no mention of _pork_, the characteristic animal
  food of China, and the only one specified by Friar Odoric in his
  account of the same city. Probably Mark may have got a little
  _Saracenized_ among the Mahomedans at the Kaan’s Court, and doubted
  if ’twere good manners to mention it. It is perhaps a relic of the
  same feeling, gendered by Saracen rule, that in Sicily pigs are
  called _i neri_.

  “The larger game, red-deer and fallow-deer, is now never seen
  for sale. Hog-deer, wild-swine, pheasants, water-fowl, and every
  description of ‘vermin’ and small birds, are exposed for sale, not
  now in markets, but at the retail wine shops. Wild-cats, racoons,
  otters, badgers, kites, owls, etc., etc., festoon the shop fronts
  along with game.” (_Moule_.)

  NOTE 5.—Van Braam, in passing through Shan-tung Province, speaks of
  very large pears. “The colour is a beautiful golden yellow. Before
  it is pared the pear is somewhat hard, but in eating it the juice
  flows, the pulp melts, and the taste is pleasant enough.” Williams
  says these Shan-tung pears are largely exported, but he is not so
  complimentary to them as Polo: “The pears are large and juicy,
  sometimes weighing 8 or 10 pounds, but remarkably tasteless and
  coarse.” (_V. Braam_, II. 33–34; _Mid. Kingd._, I. 78 and II. 44).
  In the beginning of 1867 I saw pears in Covent Garden Market which
  I should guess to have weighed 7 or 8 lbs. each. They were priced
  at 18 guineas a dozen!

  [“Large pears are nowadays produced in Shan-tung and Manchuria,
  but they are rather tasteless and coarse. I am inclined to suppose
  that Polo’s large pears were Chinese quinces, _Cydonia chinensis_,
  Thouin, this fruit being of enormous size, sometimes one foot
  long, and very fragrant. The Chinese use it for sweet-meats.”
  (_Bretschneider, Hist. of Bot. Disc._ I. p. 2.)—H. C.]

  As regards the “yellow and white” peaches, Marsden supposes the
  former to be apricots. Two kinds of peach, correctly so described,
  are indeed common in Sicily, where I write;—and both are, in their
  raw state, equally good food for _i neri_! But I see Mr. Moule also
  identifies the yellow peach with “the _hwang-mei_ or clingstone
  apricot,” as he knows no yellow peach in China.

  NOTE 6.—“_E non veggono mai l’ora che di nuovo possano
  ritornarvi;_” a curious Italian idiom. (See _Vocab. It. Univ._ sub.
  v. “_vedere_”.)

  NOTE 7.—It would seem that the habits of the Chinese in reference
  to the use of pepper and such spices have changed. Besides this
  passage, implying that their consumption of pepper was large,
  Marco tells us below (ch. lxxxii.) that for one shipload of pepper
  carried to Alexandria for the consumption of Christendom, a hundred
  went to Zayton in Manzi. At the present day, according to Williams,
  the Chinese use little spice; pepper chiefly as a febrifuge in
  the shape of _pepper-tea_, and that even less than they did some
  years ago. (See p. 239, _infra_, and _Mid. Kingd._, II. 46, 408.)
  On this, however, Mr. Moule observes: “Pepper is not so completely
  relegated to the doctors. A month or two ago, passing a portable
  cookshop in the city, I heard a girl-purchaser cry to the cook, ‘Be
  sure you put in _pepper and leeks!_’”

  NOTE 8.—Marsden, after referring to the ingenious frauds commonly
  related of Chinese traders, observes: “In the long continued
  intercourse that has subsisted between the agents of the European
  companies and the more eminent of the Chinese merchants ...
  complaints on the ground of commercial unfairness have been
  extremely rare, and on the contrary, their transactions have been
  marked with the most perfect good faith and mutual confidence.”
  Mr. Consul Medhurst bears similar strong testimony to the upright
  dealings of Chinese merchants. His remark that, as a rule, he has
  found that the Chinese deteriorate by intimacy with foreigners
  is worthy of notice;[3] it is a remark capable of application
  wherever the East and West come into habitual contact. Favourable
  opinions among the nations on their frontiers of Chinese dealing,
  as expressed to Wood and Burnes in Turkestan, and to Macleod and
  Richardson in Laos, have been quoted by me elsewhere in reference
  to the old classical reputation of the Seres for integrity. Indeed,
  Marco’s whole account of the people here might pass for an expanded
  paraphrase of the Latin commonplaces regarding the Seres. Mr.
  Milne, a missionary for many years in China, stands up manfully
  against the wholesale disparagement or Chinese character (p. 401).

  NOTE 9.—Semedo and Martini, in the 17th century, give a very
  similar account of the Lake Si-hu, the parties of pleasure
  frequenting it, and their gay barges. (_Semedo_, pp. 20–21; _Mart._
  p. 9.) But here is a Chinese picture of the very thing described
  by Marco, under the Sung Dynasty: “When Yaou Shunming was Prefect
  of Hangchow, there was an old woman, who said she was formerly a
  singing-girl, and in the service of Tung-p’o Seen-sheng.[4] She
  related that her master, whenever he found a leisure day in spring,
  would invite friends to take their pleasure on the lake. They used
  to take an early meal on some agreeable spot, and, the repast over,
  a chief was chosen for the company of each barge, who called a
  number of dancing-girls to follow them to any place they chose. As
  the day waned a gong sounded to assemble all once more at ‘Lake
  Prospect Chambers,’ or at the ‘Bamboo Pavilion,’ or some place of
  the kind, where they amused themselves to the top of their bent,
  and then, at the first or second drum, before the evening market
  dispersed, returned home by candle-light. In the city, gentlemen
  and ladies assembled in crowds, lining the way to see the return of
  the thousand Knights. It must have been a brave spectacle of that
  time.” (_Moule_, from the _Si-hu-Chi_, or “Topography of the West
  Lake.”) It is evident, from what Mr. Moule says, that this book
  abounds in interesting illustration of these two chapters of Polo.
  Barges with paddle-wheels are alluded to.

  NOTE 10.—Public carriages are still used in the great cities of
  the north, such as Peking. Possibly this is a revival. At one time
  carriages appear to have been much more general in China than they
  were afterwards, or are now. Semedo says they were abandoned in
  China just about the time that they were adopted in Europe, viz. in
  the 16th century. And this disuse seems to have been either cause
  or effect of the neglect of the roads, of which so high an account
  is given in old times. (_Semedo; N. and Q. Ch. and Jap._ I. 94.)

  Deguignes describes the public carriages of Peking, as “shaped like
  a palankin, but of a longer form, with a rounded top, lined outside
  and in with coarse blue cloth, and provided with black cushions”
  (I. 372). This corresponds with our author’s description, and with
  a drawing by Alexander among his published sketches. The present
  Peking cab is evidently the same vehicle, but smaller.

  NOTE 11.—The character of the King of Manzi here given corresponds
  to that which the Chinese histories assign to the Emperor Tu-Tsong,
  in whose time Kúblái commenced his enterprise against Southern
  China, but who died two years before the fall of the capital. He
  is described as given up to wine and women, and indifferent to all
  public business, which he committed to unworthy ministers. The
  following words, quoted by Mr. Moule from the _Hang-Chau Fu-Chi_,
  are like an echo of Marco’s: “In those days the dynasty was holding
  on to a mere corner of the realm, hardly able to defend even
  that; and nevertheless all, high and low, devoted themselves to
  dress and ornament, to music and dancing on the lake and amongst
  the hills, with no idea of sympathy for the country.” A garden
  called Tseu-king (“of many prospects”) near the Tsing-po Gate, and
  a monastery west of the lake, near the Lingin, are mentioned as
  pleasure haunts of the Sung Kings.

  NOTE 12.—The statement that the palace of Kingszé was occupied
  by the Great Kaan’s lieutenant seems to be inconsistent with the
  notice in De Mailla that Kúblái made it over to the Buddhist
  priests. Perhaps _Kúblái’s_ name is a mistake; for one of Mr.
  Moule’s books (_Jin-ho-hien-chi_) says that under _the last_ Mongol
  Emperor five convents were built on the area of the palace.

  Mr. H. Murray argues, from this closing passage especially,
  that Marco never could have been the author of the Ramusian
  interpolations; but with this I cannot agree. Did this passage
  stand alone we might doubt if it were Marco’s; but the
  interpolations must be considered as a whole. Many of them bear to
  my mind clear evidence of being his own, and I do not see that the
  present one _may_ not be his. The picture conveyed of the ruined
  walls and half-obliterated buildings does, it is true, give the
  impression of a long interval between their abandonment and the
  traveller’s visit, whilst the whole interval between the capture of
  the city and Polo’s departure from China was not more than fifteen
  or sixteen years. But this is too vague a basis for theorising.

  Mr. Moule has ascertained by maps of the Sung period, and by a
  variety of notices in the Topographies, that the palace lay to the
  south and south-east of the present city, and included a large part
  of the fine hills called _Fung-hwang Shan_ or Phœnix Mount,[5] and
  other names, whilst its southern gate opened near the Ts’ien-T’ang
  River. Its north gate is supposed to have been the Fung Shan Gate
  of the present city, and the chief street thus formed the avenue to
  the palace.

  [Illustration: Stone _Chwang_, or Umbrella Column, on site of
    “Brahma’s Temple,” Hang-chau.]

  By the kindness of Messrs. Moule and Wylie, I am able to give a
  copy of the Sung Map of the Palace (for origin of which see list
  of illustrations). I should note that the orientation is different
  from that of the map of the city already given. This map elucidates
  Polo’s account of the palace in a highly interesting manner.

  [Father H. Havret has given in p. 21 of _Variétés Sinologiques_,
  No. 19, a complete study of the inscription of a _chwang_, nearly
  similar to the one given here, which is erected near Ch’êng-tu.—H. C.]

  Before quitting KINSAY, the description of which forms the most
  striking feature in Polo’s account of China, it is worth while to
  quote other notices from authors of nearly the same age. However
  exaggerated some of these may be, there can be little doubt that it
  was the greatest city then existing in the world.

  _Friar Odoric_ (in China about 1324–1327):—“Departing thence I
  came unto the city of CANSAY, a name which signifieth the ‘City of
  Heaven.’ And ’tis the greatest city in the whole world, so great
  indeed that I should scarcely venture to tell of it, but that I
  have met at Venice people in plenty who have been there. It is a
  good hundred miles in compass, and there is not in it a span of
  ground which is not well peopled. And many a tenement is there
  which shall have 10 or 12 households comprised in it. And there
  be also great suburbs which contain a greater population than
  even the city itself.... This city is situated upon lagoons of
  standing water, with canals like the city of Venice. And it hath
  more than 12,000 bridges, on each of which are stationed guards,
  guarding the city on behalf of the Great Kaan. And at the side
  of this city there flows a river near which it is built, like
  Ferrara by the Po, for it is longer than it is broad,” and so on,
  relating how his host took him to see a great monastery of the
  idolaters, where there was a garden full of grottoes, and therein
  many animals of divers kinds, which they believed to be inhabited
  by the souls of gentlemen. “But if any one should desire to tell
  all the vastness and great marvels of this city, a good quire of
  stationery would not hold the matter, I trow. For ’tis the greatest
  and noblest city, and the finest for merchandize that the whole
  world containeth.” (_Cathay_, 113 _seqq._)

  [Illustration: South Part of KING-SZÉ with the SUNG PALACE, from
    a Chinese reprint of a Plan dated circa A.D. 1270.

    Lit. Frauenfelder, Palermo]

  _The Archbishop of Soltania_ (_circa_ 1330):—“And so vast is the
  number of people that the soldiers alone who are posted to keep
  ward in the city of Cambalec are 40,000 men by sure tale. And in
  the city of CASSAY there be yet more, for its people is greater in
  number, seeing that it is a city of very great trade. And to this
  city all the traders of the country come to trade; and greatly it
  aboundeth in all manner of merchandize.” (_Ib._ 244–245.)

  _John Marignolli_ (in China 1342–1347):—“Now Manzi is a country
  which has countless cities and nations included in it, past all
  belief to one who has not seen them.... And among the rest is that
  most famous city of CAMPSAY, the finest, the biggest, the richest,
  the most populous, and altogether the most marvellous city, the
  city of the greatest wealth and luxury, of the most splendid
  buildings (especially idol-temples, in some of which there are 1000
  and 2000 monks dwelling together), that exists now upon the face
  of the earth, or mayhap that ever did exist.” (_Ib._ p. 354.) He
  also speaks, like Odoric, of the “cloister at Campsay, in that most
  famous monastery where they keep so many monstrous animals, which
  they believe to be the souls of the departed” (384). Perhaps this
  monastery may yet be identified. Odoric calls it _Thebe_. [See _A.
  Vissière, Bul. Soc. Géog. Com._, 1901, pp. 112–113.—H. C.]

  Turning now to Asiatic writers, we begin with _Wassáf_ (A.D. 1300):—

  “KHANZAI is the greatest city of the cities of Chín,

    “‘_Stretching like Paradise through the breadth of Heaven._’

  “Its shape is oblong, and the measurement of its perimeter is
  about 24 parasangs. Its streets are paved with burnt brick and
  with stone. The public edifices and the houses are built of wood,
  and adorned with a profusion of paintings of exquisite elegance.
  Between one end of the city and the other there are three _Yams_
  (post-stations) established. The length of the chief streets is
  three parasangs, and the city contains 64 quadrangles corresponding
  to one another in structure, and with parallel ranges of columns.
  The salt excise brings in daily 700 _balish_ in paper-money.
  The number of craftsmen is so great that 32,000 are employed at
  the dyer’s art alone; from that fact you may estimate the rest.
  There are in the city 70 _tomans_ of soldiers and 70 _tomans_ of
  _rayats_, whose number is registered in the books of the Dewán.
  There are 700 churches (_Kalísíá_) resembling fortresses, and every
  one of them overflowing with presbyters without faith, and monks
  without religion, besides other officials, wardens, servants of the
  idols, and this, that, and the other, to tell the names of which
  would surpass number and space. All these are exempt from taxes
  of every kind. Four _tomans_ of the garrison constitute the night
  patrol.... Amid the city there are 360 bridges erected over canals
  ample as the Tigris, which are ramifications of the great river of
  Chín; and different kinds of vessels and ferry-boats, adapted to
  every class, ply upon the waters in such numbers as to pass all
  powers of enumeration.... The concourse of all kinds of foreigners
  from the four quarters of the world, such as the calls of trade
  and travel bring together in a kingdom like this, may easily be
  conceived.” (_Revised on Hammer’s Translation_, pp. 42–43.)

  The Persian work _Nuzhát-al-Ḳulúb_:—“KHINZAI is the capital of the
  country of Máchín. If one may believe what some travellers say,
  there exists no greater city on the face of the earth; but anyhow,
  all agree that it is the greatest in all the countries in the East.
  Inside the place is a lake which has a circuit of six parasangs,
  and all round which houses are built.... The population is so
  numerous that the watchmen are some 10,000 in number.” (_Quat.
  Rash._ p. lxxxviii.)

  The Arabic work _Masálak-al-Absár_:—“Two routes lead from Khanbalik
  to KHINSÁ, one by land, the other by water; and either way takes 40
  days. The city of Khinsá extends a whole day’s journey in length
  and half a day’s journey in breadth. In the middle of it is a
  street which runs right from one end to the other. The streets and
  squares are all paved; the houses are five-storied (?), and are
  built with planks nailed together,” etc. (_Ibid._)

  _Ibn Batuta_:—“We arrived at the city of KHANSÁ.... This city is
  the greatest I have ever seen on the surface of the earth. It is
  three days’ journey in length, so that a traveller passing through
  the city has to make his marches and his halts!... It is subdivided
  into six towns, each of which has a separate enclosure, while one
  great wall surrounds the whole,” etc. (_Cathay_, p. 496 _seqq._)

  Let us conclude with a writer of a later age, the worthy Jesuit
  Martin Martini, the author of the admirable _Atlas Sinensis_,
  one whose honourable zeal to maintain Polo’s veracity, of which
  he was one of the first intelligent advocates, is apt, it must
  be confessed, a little to colour his own spectacles:—“That the
  cosmographers of Europe may no longer make such ridiculous errors
  as to the QUINSAI of Marco Polo, I will here give you the very
  place. [He then explains the name.] ... And to come to the point;
  this is the very city that hath those bridges so lofty and so
  numberless, both within the walls and in the suburbs; nor will
  they fall much short of the 10,000 which the Venetian alleges,
  if you count also the triumphal arches among the bridges, as he
  might easily do because of their analogous structure, just as he
  calls tigers _lions_; ... or if you will, he may have meant to
  include not merely the bridges in the city and suburbs, but in the
  whole of the dependent territory. In that case indeed the number
  which Europeans find it so hard to believe might well be set
  still higher, so vast is everywhere the number of bridges and of
  triumphal arches. Another point in confirmation is that lake which
  he mentions of 40 Italian miles in circuit. This exists under the
  name of _Si-hu_; it is not, indeed, as the book says, inside the
  walls, but lies in contact with them for a long distance on the
  west and south-west, and a number of canals drawn from it _do_
  enter the city. Moreover, the shores of the lake on every side are
  so thickly studded with temples, monasteries, palaces, museums,
  and private houses, that you would suppose yourself to be passing
  through the midst of a great city rather than a country scene.
  Quays of cut stone are built along the banks, affording a spacious
  promenade; and causeways cross the lake itself, furnished with
  lofty bridges, to allow of the passage of boats; and thus you can
  readily walk all about the lake on this side and on that. ’Tis no
  wonder that Polo considered it to be part of the city. This, too,
  is the very city that hath within the walls, near the south side,
  a hill called _Ching-hoang_ [6] on which stands that tower with
  the watchmen, on which there is a clepsydra to measure the hours,
  and where each hour is announced by the exhibition of a placard,
  with gilt letters of a foot and a half in height. This is the very
  city the streets of which are paved with squared stones: the city
  which lies in a swampy situation, and is intersected by a number
  of navigable canals; this, in short, is the city from which the
  emperor escaped to seaward by the great river Ts’ien-T’ang, the
  breadth of which exceeds a German mile, flowing on the south of the
  city, exactly corresponding to the river described by the Venetian
  at Quinsai, and flowing eastward to the sea, which it enters
  precisely at the distance which he mentions. I will add that the
  compass of the city will be 100 Italian miles and more, if you
  include its vast suburbs, which run out on every side an enormous
  distance; insomuch that you may walk for 50 Chinese _li_ in a
  straight line from north to south, the whole way through crowded
  blocks of houses, and without encountering a spot that is not full
  of dwellings and full of people; whilst from east to west you can
  do very nearly the same thing.” (_Atlas Sinensis_, p. 99.)

  And so we quit what Mr. Moule appropriately calls “Marco’s famous
  rhapsody of the Manzi capital”; perhaps the most striking section
  of the whole book, as manifestly the subject was that which had
  made the strongest impression on the narrator.

                           CHAPTER LXXVIII.

     TREATING OF THE GREAT YEARLY REVENUE THAT THE GREAT KAAN HATH
                             FROM KINSAY.


Now I will tell you about the great revenue which the Great Kaan
draweth every year from the said city of Kinsay and its territory,
forming a ninth part of the whole country of Manzi.

First there is the salt, which brings in a great revenue. For it
produces every year, in round numbers, fourscore _tomans_ of gold; and
the _toman_ is worth 70,000 _saggi_ of gold, so that the total value
of the fourscore tomans will be five millions and six hundred thousand
_saggi_ of gold, each saggio being worth more than a gold florin or
ducat; in sooth, a vast sum of money! [This province, you see, adjoins
the ocean, on the shores of which are many lagoons or salt marshes, in
which the sea-water dries up during the summer time; and thence they
extract such a quantity of salt as suffices for the supply of five of
the kingdoms of Manzi besides this one.]

Having told you of the revenue from salt, I will now tell you of that
which accrues to the Great Kaan from the duties on merchandize and
other matters.

You must know that in this city and its dependencies they make great
quantities of sugar, as indeed they do in the other eight divisions
of this country; so that I believe the whole of the rest of the world
together does not produce such a quantity, at least, if that be true
which many people have told me; and the sugar alone again produces
an enormous revenue.—However, I will not repeat the duties on every
article separately, but tell you how they go in the lump. Well,
all spicery pays three and a third per cent. on the value; and all
merchandize likewise pays three and a third per cent. [But sea-borne
goods from India and other distant countries pay ten per cent.] The
rice-wine also makes a great return, and coals, of which there is a
great quantity; and so do the twelve guilds of craftsmen that I told
you of, with their 12,000 stations apiece, for every article they make
pays duty. And the silk which is produced in such abundance makes an
immense return. But why should I make a long story of it? The silk, you
must know, pays ten per cent., and many other articles also pay ten per
cent.

And you must know that Messer Marco Polo, who relates all this, was
several times sent by the Great Kaan to inspect the amount of his
customs and revenue from this ninth part of Manzi,{1} and he found it
to be, exclusive of the salt revenue which we have mentioned already,
210 _tomans_ of gold, equivalent to 14,700,000 _saggi_ of gold; one of
the most enormous revenues that ever was heard of. And if the sovereign
has such a revenue from one-ninth part of the country, you may judge
what he must have from the whole of it! However, to speak the truth,
this part is the greatest and most productive; and because of the
great revenue that the Great Kaan derives from it, it is his favourite
province, and he takes all the more care to watch it well, and to keep
the people contented.{2}

Now we will quit this city and speak of others.


  NOTE 1.—Pauthier’s text seems to be the only one which says that
  Marco was sent by the Great Kaan. The G. Text says merely: “_Si qe
  jeo March Pol qe plusor foies hoï faire le conte de la rende de
  tous cestes couses_,”—“had several times heard the calculations
  made.”

  NOTE 2.—_Toman_ is 10,000. And the first question that occurs in
  considering the statements of this chapter is as to the unit of
  these tomans, as intended by Polo. I believe it to have been the
  _tael_ (or Chinese ounce) of gold.

  We do not know that the Chinese ever made monetary calculations
  in gold. But the usual unit of the revenue accounts appears from
  Pauthier’s extracts to have been the _ting_, _i.e._ a money of
  account equal to ten taels of silver, and we know (_supra_, ch. l.
  note 4) that this was in those days the exact equivalent of one
  tael of gold.

  The equation in our text is 10,000 _x_ = 70,000 saggi of gold,
  giving _x_, or the unit sought, = 7 _saggi_. But in both Ramusio
  on the one hand, and in the Geog. Latin and Crusca Italian texts
  on the other hand, the equivalent of the toman is 80,000 _saggi_;
  though it is true that neither with one valuation nor the other
  are the calculations consistent in any of the texts, except
  Ramusio’s.[1] This consistency does not give any greater weight
  to Ramusio’s reading, because we know that version to have been
  _edited_, and corrected when the editor thought it necessary: but
  I adopt his valuation, because we shall find other grounds for
  preferring it. The unit of the _toman_ then is = 8 _saggi_.

  The Venice saggio was one-sixth of a Venice ounce. The Venice mark
  of 8 ounces I find stated to contain 3681 grains troy;[2] hence the
  _saggio_ = 76 grains. But I imagine the term to be used by Polo
  here and in other Oriental computations, to express the Arabic
  _misḳál_, the real weight of which, according to Mr. Maskelyne, is
  74 grains troy. The _misḳál_ of gold was, as Polo says, something
  more than a ducat or sequin, indeed, weight for weight, it was to a
  ducat nearly as 1·4:1.

  Eight _saggi_ or _misḳáls_ would be 592 grains troy. The tael is
  580, and the approximation is as near as we can reasonably expect
  from a calculation in such terms.

  Taking the silver tael at 6_s._ 7_d._, the gold tael, or rather
  the _ting_, would be = 3_l._ 5_s._ 10_d._; the _toman_ =
  32,916_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._; and the whole salt revenue (80 tomans)
  = 2,633,333_l._; the revenue from other sources (210 tomans) =
  6,912,500_l._; total revenue from Kinsay and its province (290
  tomans) = 9,545,833_l._ A sufficiently startling statement, and
  quite enough to account for the sobriquet of Marco Milioni.

  Pauthier, in reference to this chapter, brings forward a number of
  extracts regarding Mongol finance from the official history of that
  dynasty. The extracts are extremely interesting in themselves, but
  I cannot find in them that confirmation of Marco’s accuracy which
  M. Pauthier sees.

  First as to the salt revenue of Kiang-Ché, or the province of
  Kinsay. The facts given by Pauthier amount to these: that in
  1277, the year in which the Mongol salt department was organised,
  the manufacture of salt amounted to 92,148 _yin_, or 22,115,520
  _kilos._; in 1286 it had reached 450,000 _yin_, or 108,000,000
  _kilos._; in 1289 it fell off by 100,000 _yin_.

  The price was, in 1277, 18 _liang_ or taels, in _chao_ or
  paper-money of the years 1260–64 (see vol. i. p. 426); in 1282 it
  was raised to 22 taels; in 1284 a permanent and reduced price was
  fixed, the amount of which is not stated.

  M. Pauthier assumes as a mean 400,000 _yin_, at 18 taels, which
  will give 7,200,000 _taels_; or, at 6_s._ 7_d._ to the tael,
  2,370,000_l._ But this amount being in _chao_ or paper-currency,
  which at its highest valuation was worth only 50 per cent. of the
  nominal value of the notes, we must _halve_ the sum, giving the
  salt revenue on Pauthier’s assumptions = 1,185,000_l._

  Pauthier has also endeavoured to present a table of the whole
  revenue of Kiang-Ché under the Mongols, amounting to 12,955,710
  paper _taels_, or 2,132,294_l._, _including_ the salt revenue. This
  would leave only 947,294_l._ for the other sources of revenue,
  but the fact is that several of these are left blank, and among
  others one so important as the sea-customs. However, even making
  the extravagant supposition that the sea-customs and other omitted
  items were equal in amount to the whole of the other sources of
  revenue, salt included, the total would be only 4,264,585_l._

  Marco’s amount, as he gives it, is, I think, unquestionably a
  huge exaggeration, though I do not suppose an intentional one. In
  spite of his professed rendering of the amounts in gold, I have
  little doubt that his tomans really represent paper-currency,
  and that to get a valuation in gold, his total has to be divided
  _at the very least_ by two. We may then compare his total of 290
  tomans of paper _ting_ with Pauthier’s 130 tomans of paper _ting_,
  excluding sea-customs and some other items. No nearer comparison is
  practicable; and besides the sources of doubt already indicated, it
  remains uncertain what in either calculation are the limits of the
  province intended. For the bounds of Kiang-Ché seem to have varied
  greatly, sometimes including and sometimes excluding Fo-kien.

  I may observe that Rashiduddin reports, on the authority of the
  Mongol minister Pulad Chingsang, that the whole of Manzi brought in
  a revenue of “900 tomans.” This Quatremère renders “nine million
  pieces of gold,” presumably meaning dinars. It is unfortunate
  that there should be uncertainty here again as to the unit. If
  it were the _dinar_ the whole revenue of Manzi would be about
  5,850,000_l._, whereas if the unit were, as in the case of Polo’s
  toman, the _ting_, the revenue would be nearly 30,000,000 sterling!

  It does appear that in China a toman of some denomination of money
  near the dinar was known in account. For Friar Odoric states the
  revenue of Yang-chau in _tomans_ of _Balish_, the latter unit
  being, as he explains, a sum in paper-currency equivalent to a
  florin and a half (or something more than a dinar); perhaps,
  however, only the _liang_ or tael (see vol. i. pp. 426–7).

  It is this calculation of the Kinsay revenue which Marco is
  supposed to be expounding to his fellow-prisoner on the title-page
  of this volume. [See _P. Hoang, Commerce Public du Sel_, Shanghai,
  1898, Liang-tché-yen, pp. 6–7.—H. C.]

[1] Pauthier’s MSS. A and B are hopelessly corrupt here. His MS. C
    agrees with the Geog. Text in making the toman = 70,000 saggi, but
    210 tomans = 15,700,000, instead of 14,700,000. The Crusca and
    Latin have 80,000 saggi in the first place, but 15,700,000 in the
    second. Ramusio alone has 80,000 in the first place, and 16,800,000

                            CHAPTER LXXIX.

                  OF THE CITY OF TANPIJU AND OTHERS.


When you leave Kinsay and travel a day’s journey to the south-east,
through a plenteous region, passing a succession of dwellings and
charming gardens, you reach the city of TANPIJU, a great, rich, and
fine city, under Kinsay. The people are subject to the Kaan, and
have paper-money, and are Idolaters, and burn their dead in the way
described before. They live by trade and manufactures and handicrafts,
and have all necessaries in great plenty and cheapness.{1}

But there is no more to be said about it, so we proceed, and I will
tell you of another city called VUJU at three days’ distance from
Tanpiju. The people are Idolaters, &c., and the city is under Kinsay.
They live by trade and manufactures.

Travelling through a succession of towns and villages that look like
one continuous city, two days further on to the south-east, you find
the great and fine city of GHIUJU which is under Kinsay. The people
are Idolaters, &c. They have plenty of silk, and live by trade and
handicrafts, and have all things necessary in abundance. At this city
you find the largest and longest canes that are in all Manzi; they are
full four palms in girth and 15 paces in length.{2}

When you have left Ghiuju you travel four days S.E. through a beautiful
country, in which towns and villages are very numerous. There is
abundance of game both in beasts and birds; and there are very large
and fierce lions. After those four days you come to the great and fine
city of CHANGSHAN. It is situated upon a hill which divides the River,
so that the one portion flows up country and the other down.[1] It is
still under the government of Kinsay.

I should tell you that in all the country of Manzi they have no
sheep, though they have beeves and kine, goats and kids and swine in
abundance. The people are Idolaters here, &c.

When you leave Changshan you travel three days through a very fine
country with many towns and villages, traders and craftsmen, and
abounding in game of all kinds, and arrive at the city of CUJU. The
people are Idolaters, &c., and live by trade and manufactures. It is a
fine, noble, and rich city, and is the last of the government of Kinsay
in this direction.{3} The other kingdom which we now enter, called
Fuju, is also one of the nine great divisions of Manzi as Kinsay is.


  NOTE 1.—The traveller’s route proceeds from Kinsay or Hang-chau
  southward to the mountains of Fo-kien, ascending the valley of
  the Ts’ien T’ang, commonly called by Europeans the Green River.
  The general line, directed as we shall see upon Kien-ning fu in
  Fo-kien, is clear enough, but some of the details are very obscure,
  owing partly to vague indications and partly to the excessive
  uncertainty in the reading of some of the proper names.

  No name resembling Tanpiju (G. T., _Tanpigui_; Pauthier, _Tacpiguy,
  Carpiguy, Capiguy_; Ram., _Tapinzu_) belongs, so far as has yet
  been shown, to any considerable town in the position indicated.[2]
  Both Pauthier and Mr. Kingsmill identify the place with Shao-hing
  fu, a large and busy town, compared by Fortune, as regards
  population, to Shang-hai. Shao-hing is across the broad river, and
  somewhat further down than Hang-chau: it is out of the traveller’s
  general direction; and it seems unnatural that he should commence
  his journey by passing this wide river, and yet not mention it.

  For these reasons I formerly rejected Shao-hing, and looked rather
  to Fu-yang as the representative of Tanpiju. But my opinion is
  shaken when I find both Mr. Elias and Baron Richthofen decidedly
  opposed to Fu-yang, and the latter altogether in favour of
  Shao-hing. “The journey through a plenteous region, passing a
  succession of dwellings and charming gardens; the epithets ‘great,
  rich, and fine city’; the ‘trade, manufactures, and handicrafts,’
  and the ‘necessaries in great plenty and cheapness,’ appear to
  apply rather to the populous plain and the large city of ancient
  fame, than to the small Fu-yang hien ... shut in by a spur from
  the hills, which would hardly have allowed it in former days to
  have been a great city.” (_Note by Baron R._) The after route, as
  elucidated by the same authority, points with even more force to
  Shao-hing.

  [Mr. G. Phillips has made a special study of the route from Kinsay
  to Zaytun in the _T’oung Pao_, I. p. 218 _seq._ (_The Identity of
  Marco Polo’s Zaitun with Changchau_). He says (p. 222): “Leaving
  Hangchau by boat for Fuhkien, the first place of importance is
  Fuyang, at 100 _li_ from Hangchau. This name does not in any way
  resemble Polo’s Ta Pin Zu, but I think it can be no other.” Mr.
  Phillips writes (pp. 221–222) that by the route he describes, he
  “intends to follow the highway which has been used by travellers
  for centuries, and the greater part of which is by water.” He adds:
  “I may mention that the boats used on this route can be luxuriously
  fitted up, and the traveller can go in them all the way from
  Hangchau to Chinghu, the head of the navigation of the Ts’ien-t’ang
  River. At this Chinghu, they disembark and hire coolies and
  chairs to take them and their luggage across the Sien-hia pass
  to Puching in Fuhkien. This route is described by Fortune in an
  opposite direction, in his _Wanderings in China_, vol. ii. p. 139.
  I am inclined to think that Polo followed this route, as the one
  given by Yule, by way of Shao-hing and Kin-hua by land, would be
  unnecessarily tedious for the ladies Polo was escorting, and there
  was no necessity to take it; more especially as there was a direct
  water route to the point for which they were making. I further
  incline to this route, as I can find no city at all fitting in with
  Yenchau, Ramusio’s Gengiu, along the route given by Yule.”

  In my paper on the Catalan Map (Paris, 1895) I gave the following
  itinerary: Kinsay (Hang-chau), Tanpiju (Shao-hing fu), Vuju
  (Kin-hwa fu), Ghiuju (K’iu-chau fu), Chan-shan (Sui-chang hien),
  Cuju (Ch’u-chau), Ke-lin-fu (Kien-ning fu), Unken (Hu-kwan), Fuju
  (Fu-chau), Zayton (Kayten, Hai-t’au), Zayton (Ts’iuen-chau), Tyunju
  (Tek-hwa).

  Regarding the burning of the dead, Mr. Phillips (_T’oung Pao_, VI.
  p. 454) quotes the following passage from a notice by M. Jaubert.
  “The town of Zaitun is situated half a day’s journey inland from
  the sea. At the place where the ships anchor, the water is fresh.
  The people drink this water and also that of the wells. Zaitun is
  30 days’ journey from Khanbaligh. The inhabitants of this town burn
  their dead either with Sandal, or Brazil wood, according to their
  means; they then throw the ashes into the river.” Mr. Phillips
  adds: “The custom of burning the dead is a long established one in
  Fuh-Kien, and does not find much favour among the upper classes. It
  exists even to this day in the central parts of the province. The
  time for cremation is generally at the time of the Tsing-Ming. At
  the commencement of the present dynasty the custom of burning the
  dead appears to have been pretty general in the Fuchow Prefecture;
  it was looked upon with disfavour by many, and the gentry
  petitioned the Authorities that proclamations forbidding it should
  be issued. It was thought unfilial for children to cremate their
  parents; and the practice of gathering up the bones of a partially
  cremated person and thrusting them into a jar, euphoniously called
  a Golden Jar, but which was really an earthen one, was much
  commented on, as, if the jar was too small to contain all the
  bones, they were broken up and put in, and many pieces got thrown
  aside. In the Changchow neighbourhood, with which we have here most
  to do, it was a universal custom in 1126 to burn the dead, and was
  in existence for many centuries after.” (See note, _supra_, II. p.
  134.)

  Captain Gill, speaking of the country near the Great Wall, writes
  (I. p. 61): [“The Chinese] consider mutton very poor food, and the
  butchers’ shops are always kept by Mongols. In these, however, both
  beef and mutton can be bought for 3_d._ or 4_d._ a lb., while pork,
  which is considered by the Chinese as the greatest delicacy, sells
  for double the price.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—Che-kiang produces bamboos more abundantly than any
  province of Eastern China. Dr. Medhurst mentions meeting, on the
  waters near Hang-chau, with numerous rafts of bamboos, one of which
  was one-third of a mile in length. (_Glance at Int. of China_, p.
  53.)

  NOTE 3.—Assuming Tanpiju to be Shao-hing, the remaining places as
  far as the Fo-kien Frontier run thus:—

    3 days to Vuju (P. _Vugui_, G. T. _Vugui, Vuigui_, Ram. _Uguiu_).

    2  „   to Ghiuju (P. _Guiguy_, G. T. _Ghingui, Ghengui, Chengui_,
        Ram. _Gengui_).

    4  „   to Changshan (P. _Ciancian_, G. T. _Cianscian_, Ram.
        _Zengian_).

    3  „   to Cuju or Chuju (P. _Cinguy_, G. T. _Cugui_, Ram. _Gieza_).

  First as regards _Changshan_, which, with the notable circumstances
  about the waters there, constitutes the key to the route, I extract
  the following remarks from a note which Mr. Fortune has kindly sent
  me: “When we get to _Changshan_ the proof as to the route is _very
  strong_. This is undoubtedly my _Chang-shan_. The town is near the
  head of the Green River (the Ts’ien T’ang) which flows in a N.E.
  direction and falls into the Bay of Hang-chau. At Chang-shan the
  stream is no longer navigable even for small boats. Travellers
  going west or south-west walk or are carried in sedan-chairs
  across country in a westerly direction for about 30 miles to a
  town named Yuh-shan. Here there is a river which flows westward
  (‘the other half goes down’), taking the traveller rapidly in that
  direction, and passing _en route_ the towns of Kwansinfu, Hokow
  or Hokeu, and onward to the Poyang Lake.” From the careful study
  of Mr. Fortune’s published narrative I had already arrived at the
  conclusion that this was the correct explanation of the remarkable
  expressions about the division of the waters, which are closely
  analogous to those used by the traveller in ch. lxii. of this book
  when speaking of the watershed of the Great Canal at Sinjumatu.
  Paraphrased the words might run: “At Chang-shan you reach high
  ground, which interrupts the continuity of the River; from one side
  of this ridge it flows up country towards the north, from the other
  it flows down towards the south.” The expression “The River” will
  be elucidated in note 4 to ch. lxxxii. below.

  This route by the Ts’ien T’ang and the Chang-shan portage, which
  turns the danger involved in the navigation of the Yang-tzŭ and
  the Poyang Lake, was formerly a thoroughfare to the south much
  followed; though now almost abandoned through one of the indirect
  results (as Baron Richthofen points out) of steam navigation.

  The portage from Chang-shan to Yuh-shan was passed by the English
  and Dutch embassies in the end of last century, on their journeys
  from Hang-chau to Canton, and by Mr. Fortune on his way from Ningpo
  to the Bohea country of Fo-kien. It is probable that Polo on some
  occasion made the ascent of the Ts’ien T’ang by water, and that
  this leads him to notice the interruption of the navigation.

  [Mr. Phillips writes (_T. Pao_, I. p. 222): “From Fuyang the next
  point reached is Tunglu, also another 100 _li_ distant. Polo
  calls this city Ugim, a name bearing no resemblance to Tunglu,
  but this name and Ta Pin Zu are so corrupted in all editions that
  they defy conjecture. One hundred _li_ further up the river from
  Tunglu, we come to Yenchau, in which I think we have Polo’s Gengiu
  of Ramusio’s text. Yule’s text calls this city Ghiuju, possibly
  an error in transcription for Ghinju; Yenchau in ancient Chinese
  would, according to Williams, be pronounced Ngam, Ngin, and
  Ngienchau, all of which are sufficiently near Polo’s Gengiu. The
  next city reached is Lan Ki Hien or Lan Chi Hsien, famous for its
  hams, dates, and all the good things of this life, according to the
  Chinese. In this city I recognise Polo’s Zen Gi An of Ramusio. Does
  its description justify me in my identification? ‘The city of “Zen
  gi an,”’ says Ramusio, ‘is built upon a hill that stands isolated
  in the river, which latter, by dividing itself into two branches,
  appears to embrace it. These streams take opposite directions:
  one of them pursuing its course to the south-east and the other
  to the north-west.’ Fortune, in his _Wanderings in China_ (vol.
  ii. p. 139), calls Lan-Khi, Nan-Che-hien, and says: ‘It is built
  on the banks of the river, and has a picturesque hill behind it.’
  Milne, who also visited it, mentions it in his _Life in China_ (p.
  258), and says: ‘At the southern end of the suburbs of Lan-Ki the
  river divides into two branches, the one to the left on south-east
  leading direct to Kinhua.’ Milne’s description of the place is
  almost identical with Polo’s, when speaking of the division of the
  river. There are in Fuchau several Lan-Khi shopkeepers, who deal in
  hams, dates, etc., and these men tell me the city from the river
  has the appearance of being built on a hill, but the houses on
  the hill are chiefly temples. I would divide the name as follows,
  Zen gi an; the last syllable _an_ most probably represents the
  modern Hien, meaning District city, which in ancient Chinese was
  pronounced _Han_, softened by the Italians into _an_. Lan-Khi was a
  Hien in Polo’s day.”—H. C.]

  Kin-hwa fu, as Pauthier has observed, bore at this time the name
  of WU-CHAU, which Polo would certainly write _Vugiu_. And between
  Shao-hing and Kin-hwa there exists, as Baron Richthofen has pointed
  out, a line of depression which affords an easy connection between
  Shao-hing and Lan-ki hien or Kin-hwa fu. This line is much used by
  travellers, and forms just 3 short stages. Hence Kin-hwa, a fine
  city destroyed by the T’ai-P’ings, is satisfactorily identified
  with _Vugiu_.

  The journey from Vugui to Ghiuju is said to be through a succession
  of towns and villages, looking like a continuous city. Fortune,
  whose journey occurred before the T’ai-P’ing devastations, speaks
  of the approach to Kiu-chau as a vast and beautiful garden. And Mr.
  Milne’s map of this route shows an incomparable density of towns
  in the Ts’ien T’ang valley from Yen-chau up to Kiu-chau. _Ghiuju_
  then will be KIU-CHAU. But between Kiu-chau and Chang-shan it is
  impossible to make four days: barely possible to make two. My map
  (_Itineraries_, No. VI.), based on D’Anville and Fortune, makes the
  _direct_ distance 24 miles; Milne’s map barely 18; whilst from his
  book we deduce the distance travelled by water to be about 30. On
  the whole, it seems probable that there is a mistake in the figure
  here.

  [Illustration: Marco Polo’s route from Kinsai to ZAITUN,
    illustrating Mr. G. Phillips’ theory.]

  From the head of the great Che-kiang valley I find two roads
  across the mountains into Fo-kien described.

  One leads from _Kiang-shan_ (not Chang-shan) by a town called
  Ching-hu, and then, nearly due south, across the mountains to
  Pu-ch’eng in Upper Fo-kien. This is specified by Martini (p. 113):
  it seems to have been followed by the Dutch Envoy, Van Hoorn, in
  1665 (see _Astley_, III. 463), and it was travelled by Fortune on
  his return _from_ the Bohea country to Ningpo. (II. 247, 271.)

  The other route follows the portage spoken of above from
  _Chang-shan_ to Yuh-shan, and descends the river on that side to
  _Hokeu_, whence it strikes south-east across the mountains to
  Tsung-ngan-hien in Fo-kien. This route was followed by Fortune on
  his way _to_ the Bohea country.

  Both from Pu-ch’eng on the former route, and from near Tsung-ngan
  on the latter, the waters are navigable down to Kien-ning fu and so
  to Fu-chau.

  Mr. Fortune judges the first to have been Polo’s route. There
  does not, however, seem to be on this route any place that can
  be identified with his Cuju or Chuju. Ching-hu seems to be
  insignificant, and the name has no resemblance. On the other route
  followed by Mr. Fortune himself from that side we have Kwansin fu,
  _Hokeu_, Yen-shan, and (last town passed on that side) _Chuchu_.
  The latter, as to both name and position, is quite satisfactory,
  but it is described as a small poor town. _Hokeu_ would be
  represented in Polo’s spelling as Caghiu or Cughiu. It is now a
  place of great population and importance as the entrepôt of the
  Black Tea Trade, but, like many important commercial cities in
  the interior, not being even a _hien_, it has no place either in
  Duhalde or in Biot, and I cannot learn its age.

  It is no objection to this line that Polo speaks of Cuju or Chuju
  as the last city of the government of Kinsay, whilst the towns just
  named are in Kiang-si. For _Kiang-Ché_, the province of Kinsay,
  then included the eastern part of Kiang-si. (See _Cathay_, p. 270.)

  [Mr. Phillips writes (_T. Pao_, I. 223–224): “Eighty-five _li_
  beyond Lan-ki hien is Lung-yin, a place not mentioned by Polo, and
  another ninety-five _li_ still further on is Chüchau or Keuchau,
  which is, I think, the Gie-za of Ramusio, and the Cuju of Yule’s
  version. Polo describes it as the last city of the government of
  Kinsai (Che-kiang) in this direction. It is the last Prefectural
  city, but ninety _li_ beyond Chü-chau, on the road to Pu-chêng,
  is Kiang-shan, a district city which is the last one in this
  direction. Twenty _li_ from Kiang-shan is Ching-hu, the head of
  the navigation of the T’sien-T’ang river. Here one hires chairs
  and coolies for the journey over the Sien-hia Pass to Pu-chêng,
  a distance of 215 _li_. From Pu-chêng, Fu-chau can be reached by
  water in 4 or 5 days. The distance is 780 _li_.”—H. C.]

                             CHAPTER LXXX.

                    CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF FUJU.


On leaving Cuju, which is the last city of the kingdom of Kinsay, you
enter the kingdom of FUJU, and travel six days in a south-easterly
direction through a country of mountains and valleys, in which are
a number of towns and villages with great plenty of victuals and
abundance of game. Lions, great and strong, are also very numerous.
The country produces ginger and galingale in immense quantities,
insomuch that for a Venice groat you may buy fourscore pounds of good
fine-flavoured ginger. They have also a kind of fruit resembling
saffron, and which serves the purpose of saffron just as well.{1}

And you must know the people eat all manner of unclean things, even the
flesh of a man, provided he has not died a natural death. So they look
out for the bodies of those that have been put to death and eat their
flesh, which they consider excellent.{2}

Those who go to war in those parts do as I am going to tell you. They
shave the hair off the forehead and cause it to be painted in blue like
the blade of a glaive. They all go afoot except the chief; they carry
spears and swords, and are the most savage people in the world, for
they go about constantly killing people, whose blood they drink, and
then devour the bodies.{3}

Now I will quit this and speak of other matters. You must know then
that after going three days out of the six that I told you of you come
to the city of KELINFU, a very great and noble city, belonging to the
Great Kaan. This city hath three stone bridges which are among the
finest and best in the world. They are a mile long and some nine paces
in width, and they are all decorated with rich marble columns. Indeed
they are such fine and marvellous works that to build any one of them
must have cost a treasure.{4}

The people live by trade and manufactures, and have great store of silk
[which they weave into various stuffs], and of ginger and galingale.
{5} [They also make much cotton cloth of dyed thread, which is sent
all over Manzi.] Their women are particularly beautiful. And there
is a strange thing there which I needs must tell you. You must know
they have a kind of fowls which have no feathers, but hair only, like
a cat’s fur.{6} They are black all over; they lay eggs just like our
fowls, and are very good to eat.

In the other three days of the six that I have mentioned above{7}, you
continue to meet with many towns and villages, with traders, and goods
for sale, and craftsmen. The people have much silk, and are Idolaters,
and subject to the Great Kaan. There is plenty of game of all kinds,
and there are great and fierce lions which attack travellers. In the
last of those three days’ journey, when you have gone 15 miles you find
a city called UNKEN, where there is an immense quantity of sugar made.
From this city the Great Kaan gets all the sugar for the use of his
Court, a quantity worth a great amount of money. [And before this city
came under the Great Kaan these people knew not how to make fine sugar;
they only used to boil and skim the juice, which when cold left a black
paste. But after they came under the Great Kaan some men of Babylonia
who happened to be at the Court proceeded to this city and taught the
people to refine the sugar with the ashes of certain trees.{8}]

There is no more to say of the place, so now we shall speak of the
splendour of Fuju. When you have gone 15 miles from the city of Unken,
you come to this noble city which is the capital of the kingdom. So we
will now tell you what we know of it.


  NOTE 1.—The vague description does not suggest the root _turmeric_
  with which Marsden and Pauthier identify this “fruit like saffron.”
  It is probably one of the species of _Gardenia_, the fruits of
  which are used by the Chinese for their colouring properties.
  Their splendid yellow colour “is due to a body named crocine
  which appears to be identical with the polychroite of saffron.”
  (_Hanbury’s Notes on Chinese Mat. Medica_, pp. 21–22.) For this
  identification, I am indebted to Dr. Flückiger of Bern. [“Colonel
  Yule concludes that the fruit of a _Gardenia_, which yields a
  yellow colour, is meant. But Polo’s vague description might just
  as well agree with the Bastard Saffron, _Carthamus tinctorius_,
  a plant introduced into China from Western Asia in the 2nd
  century B.C., and since then much cultivated in that country.”
  (_Bretschneider, Hist. of Bot. Disc._ I. p. 4.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—See vol. i. p. 312.

  NOTE 3.—These particulars as to a race of painted or tattooed
  caterans accused of cannibalism apparently apply to some aboriginal
  tribe which still maintained its ground in the mountains between
  Fo-kien and Che-kiang or Kiang-si. Davis, alluding to the Upper
  part of the Province of Canton, says: “The Chinese History speaks
  of the aborigines of this wild region under the name of _Mân_
  (Barbarians), who within a comparatively recent period were subdued
  and incorporated into the Middle Nation. Many persons have remarked
  a decidedly Malay cast in the features of the natives of this
  province; and it is highly probable that the Canton and Fo-kien
  people were originally the same race as the tribes which still
  remain unreclaimed on the east side of Formosa.”[1] (_Supply. Vol._
  p. 260.) Indeed Martini tells us that even in the 17th century this
  very range of mountains, farther to the south, in the Ting-chau
  department of Fo-kien, contained a race of uncivilised people,
  who were enabled by the inaccessible character of the country to
  maintain their independence of the Chinese Government (p. 114; see
  also _Semedo_, p. 19).

  [“Colonel Yule’s ‘pariah caste’ of Shao-ling, who, he says,
  rebelled against either the Sung or the Yüan, are evidently the
  _tomin_ of Ningpo and _zikas_ of Wênchow. Colonel Yule’s ‘some
  aboriginal tribe between Fo-kien and Che-kiang’ are probably the
  _zikas_ of Wênchow and the _siapo_ of Fu-kien described by recent
  travellers. The _zikas_ are locally called dogs’ heads, which
  illustrates Colonel Yule’s allophylian theories.” (_Parker, China
  Review_, XIV. p. 359.) Cf. _A Visit to the “Dog-Headed Barbarians”
  or Hill People, near Fu-chow, by Rev. F. Ohlinger, Chinese
  Recorder_, July, 1886, pp. 265–268.—H. C.]

  NOTE 4.—Padre Martini long ago pointed out that this _Quelinfu_ is
  KIEN-NING FU, on the upper part of the Min River, an important city
  of Fo-kien. In the Fo-kien dialect he notices that _l_ is often
  substituted for _n_, a well-known instance of which is _Liampoo_,
  the name applied by F. M. Pinto and the old Portuguese to _Ningpo_.

  [Mr. Phillips writes (_T. Pao_, I. p. 224): “From Puchêng to
  Kien-Ning-Foo the distance is 290 _li_, all down stream. I
  consider this to have been the route followed by Polo. His calling
  Kien-Ning-Foo, Que-lin-fu, is quite correct, as far as the Ling
  is concerned, the people of the city and of the whole southern
  province pronounce Ning, Ling. The Ramusian version gives very full
  particulars regarding the manufactures of Kien-Ning-Foo, which
  are not found in the other texts; for example, silk is said in
  this version to be woven into various stuffs, and further: ‘They
  also make much cotton cloth of dyed thread which is sent all over
  Manzi.’ All this is quite true. Much silk was formerly and is still
  woven in Kien-Ning, and the manufacture of cotton cloth with dyed
  threads is very common. Such stuff is called Hung Lu Kin ‘red and
  green cloth.’ Cotton cloth, made with dyed thread, is also very
  common in our day in many other cities in Fuh-Kien.”—H. C.]

  In Ramusio the bridges are only “each more than 100 paces long and
  8 paces wide.” In Pauthier’s text _each_ is a mile long, and 20
  feet wide. I translate from the G. T.

  Martini describes _one_ beautiful bridge at Kien-ning fu: the piers
  of cut stone, the superstructure of timber, roofed in and lined
  with houses on each side (pp. 112–113). If this was over the Min
  it would seem not to survive. A recent journal says: “The river is
  crossed by a bridge of boats, the remains of a stone bridge being
  visible just above water.” (_Chinese Recorder_ (Foochow), August,
  1870, p. 65.)

  NOTE 5.—_Galanga_ or Galangal is an aromatic root belonging to
  a class of drugs once much more used than now. It exists of two
  kinds: 1. _Great_ or _Java Galangal_, the root of the _Alpinia
  Galanga_. This is rarely imported and hardly used in Europe in
  modern times, but is still found in the Indian bazaars. 2. _Lesser_
  or _China Galangal_ is imported into London from Canton, and
  is still sold by druggists in England. Its botanical origin is
  unknown. It is produced in Shan-si, Fo-kien, and Kwang-tung, and is
  called by the Chinese _Liang Kiang_ or “Mild Ginger.”

  [“According to the Chinese authors the province of Sze-ch’wan
  and Han-chung (Southern Shen-si) were in ancient times famed for
  their Ginger. Ginger is still exported in large quantities from
  Han k’ou. It is known also to be grown largely in the southern
  provinces.—Galingale is the Lesser or Chinese Galanga of commerce,
  _Alpinia officinarum_ Hance.” (_Bretschneider, Hist. of Bot. Disc._
  I. p. 2. See _Heyd, Com. Levant_, II. 616–618.)—H. C.]

  Galangal was much used as a spice in the Middle Ages. In a syrup
  for a capon, _temp._ Rich. II., we find ground-ginger, cloves,
  cinnamon and _galingale_. “Galingale” appears also as a growth in
  old English gardens, but this is believed to have been _Cyperus
  Longus_, the tubers of which were substituted for the real article
  under the name of English Galingale.

  The name appears to be a modification of the Arabic _Kulíjan_,
  Pers. _Kholinján_, and these from the Sanskrit _Kulanjana_. (_Mr.
  Hanbury; China Comm.-Guide_, 120; _Eng. Cycl.; Garcia_, f. 63;
  _Wright_, p. 352.)

  NOTE 6.—The cat in question is no doubt the fleecy Persian. These
  fowls,—but white,—are mentioned by Odoric at Fu-chau; and Mr.
  G. Phillips in a MS. note says that they are still abundant in
  Fo-kien, where he has often seen them; all that he saw or heard
  of were _white_. The Chinese call them “velvet-hair fowls.” I
  believe they are well known to poultry-fanciers in Europe. [_Gallus
  Lanatus_, Temm. See note, p. 286, of my edition of Odoric.—H. C.]

  NOTE 7.—The _times_ assigned in this chapter as we have given them,
  after the G. Text, appear very short; but I have followed that
  text because it is perfectly consistent and clear. Starting from
  the last city of Kinsay government, the traveller goes six days
  south-east; _three_ out of those six days bring him to Kelinfu;
  he goes on the other three days and at the 15th mile of the 3rd
  day reaches Unken; 15 miles further bring him to Fuju. This is
  interesting as showing that Polo reckoned his day at 30 miles.

  In Pauthier’s text again we find: “_Sachiez que quand on est alé_
  six journées, après ces trois que je vous ay dit,” not having
  mentioned _trois_ at all “_on treuve la cité de Quelifu_.” And on
  leaving Quelinfu: “_Sachiez que_ es autres trois journées oultre
  et plus xv. milles _treuve l’en une cité qui a nom Vuguen_.” This
  seems to mean from Cugui to Kelinfu six days, and thence to Vuguen
  (or Unken) three and a half days more. But evidently there has
  been bungling in the transcript, for the _es autre trois journées_
  belongs to the same conception of the distance as that in the G.
  T. Pauthier’s text does not say how far it is from Unken to Fuju.
  Ramusio makes six days to Kelinfu, three days more to Unguem, and
  then 15 miles more to Fuju (which he has erroneously as _Cãgiu_
  here, though previously given right, _Fugiu_).

  The latter scheme looks probable certainly, but the times in the G.
  T. are quite admissible, if we suppose that water conveyance was
  adopted where possible.

  For assuming that _Cugiu_ was Fortune’s Chuchu at the western
  base of the Bohea mountains (see note 3, ch. lxxix.), and that
  the traveller reached Tsun-ngan-hien, in two marches, I see that
  from Tsin-tsun, near Tsun-ngan-hien, Fortune says he could have
  reached Fu-chau in four days by boat. Again Martini, speaking of
  the skill with which the Fo-kien boatmen navigate the rocky rapids
  of the upper waters, says that even from _Pu-ch’eng_ the descent
  to the capital could be made in three days. So the thing is quite
  possible, and the G. Text may be quite correct. (See _Fortune_,
  II. 171–183 and 210; _Mart._ 110.) A party which recently made the
  journey seem to have been six days from _Hokeu_ to the Wu-e-shan
  and then five and a half days by water (but in stormy weather) to
  Fu-chau. (_Chinese Recorder_, as above.)

  NOTE 8.—Pauthier supposes Unken, or _Vuguen_ as he reads it, to be
  _Hukwan_, one of the _hiens_ under the immediate administration
  of Fu-chau city. This cannot be, according to the lucid reading
  of the G. T., making Unken 15 miles from the chief city. The only
  place which the maps show about that position is _Min-ts’ing hien_.
  And the Dutch mission of 1664–1665 names this as “_Binkin_, by some
  called Min-sing.” (_Astley_, III. 461.)

  [Mr. Phillips writes (_T. Pao_, I. 224–225): “Going down stream
  from Kien-Ning, we arrive first at Yen-Ping on the Min Main River.
  Eighty-seven _li_ further down is the mouth of the Yiu-Ki River,
  up which stream, at a distance of eighty _li_, is Yiu-Ki city,
  where travellers disembark for the land journey to Yung-chun and
  Chinchew. This route is the highway from the town of Yiu-Ki to the
  seaport of Chinchew. This I consider to have been Polo’s route,
  and Ramusio’s Unguen I believe to be Yung-chun, locally known as
  Eng-chun or Ung-chun, a name greatly resembling Polo’s Unguen.
  I look upon this mere resemblance of name as of small moment in
  comparison with the weighty and important statement, that ‘this
  place is remarkable for a great manufacture of sugar.’ Going south
  from the Min River towards Chinchew, this is the first district
  in which sugar-cane is seen growing in any quantity. Between
  Kien-Ning-Foo and Fuchau I do not know of any place remarkable
  for the _great_ manufacture of sugar. Pauthier makes How-Kuan do
  service for Unken or Unguen, but this is inadmissible, as there is
  no such place as How-Kuan; it is simply one of the divisions of
  the city of Fuchau, which is divided into two districts, viz. the
  Min-Hien and the How-Kuan-Hien. A small quantity of sugar-cane is,
  I admit, grown in the How-Kuan division of Fuchau-foo, but it is
  not extensively made into sugar. The cane grown there is usually
  cut into short pieces for chewing and hawked about the streets for
  sale. The nearest point to Foochow where sugar is made in any great
  quantity is Yung-Foo, a place quite out of Polo’s route. The great
  sugar manufacturing districts of Fuh-Kien are Hing-hwa, Yung-chun,
  Chinchew, and Chang-chau.”—H. C.]

  The _Babylonia_ of the passage from Ramusio is Cairo,—Babylon of
  Egypt, the sugar of which was very famous in the Middle Ages.
  _Zucchero di Bambellonia_ is repeatedly named in Pegolotti’s
  Handbook (210, 311, 362, etc.).

  The passage as it stands represents the Chinese as not knowing even
  how to get sugar in the granular form: but perhaps the fact was
  that they did not know how to _refine_ it. Local Chinese histories
  acknowledge that the people of Fo-kien did not know how to make
  fine sugar, till, in the time of the Mongols, certain men from
  the West taught the art.[2] It is a curious illustration of the
  passage that in India coarse sugar is commonly called _Chíní_,
  “the produce of China,” and sugar candy or fine sugar _Misri_, the
  produce of Cairo (_Babylonia_) or Egypt. Nevertheless, fine _Misri_
  has long been exported from Fo-kien to India, and down to 1862 went
  direct from Amoy. It is now, Mr. Phillips states, sent to India
  by steamers _viâ_ Hong-Kong. I see it stated, in a late Report by
  Mr. Consul Medhurst, that the sugar at this day commonly sold and
  consumed throughout China is excessively coarse and repulsive in
  appearance. (See _Academy_, February, 1874, p. 229.) [We note from
  the _Returns of Trade for 1900_, of the Chinese Customs, p. 467,
  that during that year 1900, the following quantities of sugar were
  exported from Amoy: _Brown_, 89,116 _piculs_, value 204,969 Hk.
  taels; _white_, 3,708 _piculs_, 20,024 Hk. taels; _candy_, 53,504
  _piculs_, 304,970 Hk. taels.—H. C.]

  [Dr. Bretschneider (_Hist. of Bot. Disc._ I. p. 2) remarks that
  “the sugar cane although not indigenous in China, was known to the
  Chinese in the 2nd century B.C. It is largely cultivated in the
  Southern provinces.”—H. C.]

  The fierce lions are, as usual, tigers. These are numerous in this
  province, and tradition points to the diversion of many roads,
  owing to their being infested by tigers. Tiger cubs are often
  offered for sale in Amoy.[3]

[1] “It is not improbable that there is some admixture of aboriginal
    blood in the actual population (of Fuh-Kien), but if so, it cannot
    be much. The _surnames_ in this province are the same as those in
    Central and North China.... The language also is pure Chinese;
    actually much nearer the ancient form of Chinese than the modern
    Mandarin dialect. There are indeed many words in the vernacular for

                            CHAPTER LXXXI.

             CONCERNING THE GREATNESS OF THE CITY OF FUJU.


Now this city of Fuju is the key of the kingdom which is called CHONKA,
and which is one of the nine great divisions of Manzi.{1} The city is
a seat of great trade and great manufactures. The people are Idolaters
and subject to the Great Kaan. And a large garrison is maintained there
by that prince to keep the kingdom in peace and subjection. For the
city is one which is apt to revolt on very slight provocation.

There flows through the middle of this city a great river, which is
about a mile in width, and many ships are built at the city which
are launched upon this river. Enormous quantities of sugar are made
there, and there is a great traffic in pearls and precious stones. For
many ships of India come to these parts bringing many merchants who
traffic about the Isles of the Indies. For this city is, as I must
tell you, in the vicinity of the Ocean Port of ZAYTON,{2} which is
greatly frequented by the ships of India with their cargoes of various
merchandize; and from Zayton ships come this way right up to the city
of Fuju by the river I have told you of; and ’tis in this way that the
precious wares of India come hither.{3}

The city is really a very fine one and kept in good order, and all
necessaries of life are there to be had in great abundance and
cheapness.


  NOTE 1.—The name here applied to Fo-kien by Polo is variously
  written as _Choncha, Chonka, Concha, Chouka_. It has not been
  satisfactorily explained. Klaproth and Neumann refer it to
  _Kiang-Ché_, of which Fo-kien at one time of the Mongol rule formed
  a part. This is the more improbable as Polo expressly distinguishes
  this province or kingdom from that which was under Kinsay, viz.
  Kiang-Ché. Pauthier supposes the word to represent _Kien-Kwé_, “the
  Kingdom of Kien,” because in the 8th century this territory had
  formed a principality of which the seat was at _Kien-chau_, now
  Kien-ning fu. This is not satisfactory either, for no evidence is
  adduced that the name continued in use.

  One might suppose that _Choncha_ represented _T’swan-chau_, the
  Chinese name of the city of Zayton, or rather of the department
  attached to it, written by the French _Thsiuan-tchéou_, but by
  Medhurst _Chwanchew_, were it not that Polo’s practice of writing
  the term _tchéu_ or _chau_ by _giu_ is so nearly invariable, and
  that the soft _ch_ is almost always expressed in the old texts by
  the Italian _ci_ (though the Venetian does use the soft _ch_).[1]

  It is again impossible not to be struck with the resemblance of
  _Chonka_ to “CHUNG-KWÉ” “the Middle Kingdom,” though I can suggest
  no ground for the application of such a title specially to Fo-kien,
  except a possible misapprehension. _Chonkwé_ occurs in the Persian
  _Historia Cathaica_ published by Müller, but is there specially
  applied to _North China_. (See _Quat. Rashid._, p. lxxxvi.)

  The city of course is FU-CHAU. It was visited also by Friar Odoric,
  who calls it _Fuzo_, and it appears in duplicate on the Catalan Map
  as _Fugio_ and as _Fozo_.

  I used the preceding words, “the city of course is Fu-chau,” in the
  first edition. Since then Mr. G. Phillips, of the consular staff
  in Fo-kien, has tried to prove that Polo’s Fuju is not Fu-chau
  (_Foochow_ is his spelling), but T’swan-chau. This view is bound up
  with another regarding the identity of Zayton, which will involve
  lengthy notice under next chapter; and both views have met with an
  able advocate in the Rev. Dr. C. Douglas, of Amoy.[2] I do not in
  the least accept these views about Fuju.

  In considering the objections made to Fu-chau, it must never be
  forgotten that, according to the spelling usual with Polo or his
  scribe, Fuju is not merely “a name with a great resemblance in
  sound to Foochow” (as Mr. Phillips has it); it _is_ Mr. Phillips’s
  word Foochow, just as absolutely as my word Fu-chau is his word
  Foochow. (See remarks almost at the end of the Introductory Essay.)
  And what has to be proved against me in this matter is, that when
  Polo _speaks_ of Fu-chau he does not _mean_ Fu-chau. It must also
  be observed that the distances as given by Polo (three days from
  Quelinfu to Fuju, five days from Fuju to Zayton) do correspond well
  with my interpretations, and do _not_ correspond with the other.
  These are very strong fences of my position, and it demands strong
  arguments to level them. The adverse arguments (in brief) are these:

  (1.) That Fu-chau was not the capital of Fo-kien (“_chief dou
  reigne_”).

  (2.) That the River of Fu-chau does not flow through the middle of
  the city (“_por le mi de cest cité_”), nor even under the walls.

  (3.) That Fu-chau was not frequented by foreign trade till
  centuries afterwards.

  The first objection will be more conveniently answered under next
  chapter.

  As regards the second, the fact urged is true. But even now a
  straggling street extends to the river, ending in a large suburb
  on its banks, and a famous bridge there crosses the river to the
  south side where now the foreign settlements are. There _may_ have
  been suburbs on that side to justify the _por le mi_, or these
  words may have been a slip; for the Traveller begins the next
  chapter—“When you quit Fuju (to go south) you _cross the river_.”[3]

  Touching the question of foreign commerce, I do not see that Mr.
  Phillips’s negative evidence would be sufficient to establish
  his point. But, in fact, the words of the Geog. Text (_i.e._ the
  original dictation), which we have followed, do not (as I now see)
  necessarily involve any foreign trade at Fu-chau, the impression
  of which has been derived mainly from Ramusio’s text. They appear
  to imply no more than that, through the vicinity of Zayton, there
  was a great influx of Indian wares, which were brought on from the
  great port by vessels (it may be local junks) ascending the river
  Min.[4]

  [Illustration: Scene on the Min River, below Fu-chau. (From
    Fortune.)

  “=E sachiés che por le mi de ceste cité vait un grant flun qe bien
  est large un mil, et en ceste cité se font maintes nés lesquelz
  najent por cel flum.=”]

  [Mr. Phillips gives the following itinerary after Unguen: Kangiu =
  Chinchew = Chuan-chiu or Ts’wan-chiu. He writes (_T. Pao_, I. p.
  227): “When you leave the city of Chinchew for Changchau, which
  lies in a south-westerly, not a south-easterly direction, you cross
  the river by a handsome bridge, and travelling for five days by way
  of Tung-an, locally Tang-oa, you arrive at Changchau. Along this
  route in many parts, more especially in that part lying between
  Tang-oa and Changchau, very large camphor-trees are met with. I
  have frequently travelled over this road. The road from Fuchau to
  Chinchew, which also takes five days to travel over, is bleak and
  barren, lying chiefly along the sea-coast, and in winter a most
  uncomfortable journey. But few trees are met with; a banyan here
  and there, but no camphor-trees along this route; but there is one
  extremely interesting feature on it that would strike the most
  unobservant traveller, viz.: the Loyang bridge, one of the wonders
  of China.” Had Polo travelled by this route, he would certainly
  have mentioned it. Pauthier remarks upon Polo’s silence in this
  matter: “It is surprising,” says he, “that Marco Polo makes no
  mention of it.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—The G. T. reads _Caiton_, presumably for Çaiton or Zayton.
  In Pauthier’s text, in the following chapter, the name of Zayton is
  written _Çaiton_ and _Çayton_, and the name of that port appears
  in the same form in the Letter of its Bishop, Andrew of Perugia,
  quoted in note 2, ch. lxxxii. Pauthier, however, in _this_ place
  reads _Kayteu_, which he develops into a port at the mouth of the
  River Min.[5]

  NOTE 3.—The Min, the River of Fu-chau, “varies much in width and
  depth. Near its mouth, and at some other parts, it is not less than
  a mile in width, elsewhere deep and rapid.” It is navigable for
  ships of large size 20 miles from the mouth, and for good-sized
  junks thence to the great bridge. The scenery is very fine, and is
  compared to that of the Hudson. (_Fortune_, I. 281; _Chin. Repos._
  XVI. 483.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] Dr. Medhurst calls the proper name of the city, as distinct from
    the _Fu_, _Chinkang_ (_Dict. of the Hok-keen dialect_). Dr. Douglas
    has suggested _Chinkang_, and _T’swan-kok_, _i.e._ “Kingdom of
    T’swan” (chau), as possible explanations of _Chonka_.

[2] Mr. Phillips’s views were issued first in the _Chinese Recorder_
    (published by Missionaries at Fu-Chau) in 1870, and afterwards
    sent to the R. Geo. Soc., in whose Journal for 1874 they appeared,
    with remarks in reply more detailed than I can introduce here. Dr.
    Douglas’s notes were received after this sheet was in proof, and it
    will be seen that they modify to a certain extent my views about
    Zayton, though not about Fu-chau. His notes, which do more justice
    to the question than Mr. Phillips’s, should find a place with the
    other papers in the Geog. Society’s Journal.

[3] There is a capital lithograph of Fu-chau in _Fortune’s Three
    Years’ Wanderings_ (1847), in which the city shows as on a river,
    and Fortune always so speaks of it; _e.g._ (p. 369): “The river
    runs through the suburbs.” I do not know what is the worth of the
    old engravings in Montanus. A view of Fu-chau in one of these
    (reproduced in _Astley_, iv. 33) shows a broad creek from the river
    penetrating to the heart of the city.

[4] The words of the G. T. are these: “_Il hi se fait grant mercandies
    de perles e d’autres pieres presiose, e ce est por ce que les nés
    de Yndie hi vienent maintes con maint merchaant qe usent en les
    ysles de Endie, et encore voz di que ceste ville est prés au port
    de Caiton en la mer Osiane; et illuec vienent maintes nés de Indie
    con maintes mercandies, e puis de cest part vienent les nés por le
    grant flum qe je voz ai dit desoure jusque à la cité de Fugui, et
    en ceste mainere hi vienent chieres cousse de Indie._”

[5] It is odd enough that Martini (though M. Pauthier apparently was
    not aware of it) does show a fort called _Haiteu_ at the mouth of
    the Min; but I believe this to be merely an accidental coincidence.
    The various readings must be looked at together; that of the G.
    T. which I have followed is clear in itself and accounts for the
    others.




                            CHAPTER LXXXII.

                OF THE CITY AND GREAT HAVEN OF ZAYTON.


Now when you quit Fuju and cross the River, you travel for five days
south-east through a fine country, meeting with a constant succession
of flourishing cities, towns, and villages, rich in every product. You
travel by mountains and valleys and plains, and in some places by great
forests in which are many of the trees which give Camphor.{1} There
is plenty of game on the road, both of bird and beast. The people are
all traders and craftsmen, subjects of the Great Kaan, and under the
government of Fuju. When you have accomplished those five days’ journey
you arrive at the very great and noble city of ZAYTON, which is also
subject to Fuju.

At this city you must know is the Haven of Zayton, frequented by all
the ships of India, which bring thither spicery and all other kinds
of costly wares. It is the port also that is frequented by all the
merchants of Manzi, for hither is imported the most astonishing
quantity of goods and of precious stones and pearls, and from this
they are distributed all over Manzi.{2} And I assure you that for one
shipload of pepper that goes to Alexandria or elsewhere, destined for
Christendom, there come a hundred such, aye and more too, to this haven
of Zayton; for it is one of the two greatest havens in the world for
commerce.{3}

The Great Kaan derives a very large revenue from the duties paid in
this city and haven; for you must know that on all the merchandize
imported, including precious stones and pearls, he levies a duty of ten
per cent., or in other words takes tithe of everything. Then again the
ship’s charge for freight on small wares is 30 per cent., on pepper 44
per cent., and on lignaloes, sandalwood, and other bulky goods 40 per
cent., so that between freight and the Kaan’s duties the merchant has
to pay a good half the value of his investment [though on the other
half he makes such a profit that he is always glad to come back with a
new supply of merchandize]. But you may well believe from what I have
said that the Kaan hath a vast revenue from this city.

There is a great abundance here of all provision for every necessity
of man’s life. [It is a charming country, and the people are very
quiet, and fond of an easy life. Many come hither from Upper India to
have their bodies painted with the needle in the way we have elsewhere
described, there being many adepts at this craft in the city.{4}]

Let me tell you also that in this province there is a town called
TYUNJU, where they make vessels of porcelain of all sizes, the finest
that can be imagined. They make it nowhere but in that city, and thence
it is exported all over the world. Here it is abundant and very cheap,
insomuch that for a Venice groat you can buy three dishes so fine that
you could not imagine better.{5}

I should tell you that in this city (_i.e._ of Zayton) they have a
peculiar language. [For you must know that throughout all Manzi they
employ one speech and one kind of writing only, but yet there are
local differences of dialect, as you might say of Genoese, Milanese,
Florentines, and Neapolitans, who though they speak different dialects
can understand one another.{6}]

And I assure you that the Great Kaan has as large customs and revenues
from this kingdom of Chonka as from Kinsay, aye and more too.{7}

We have now spoken of but three out of the nine kingdoms of Manzi, to
wit Yanju and Kinsay and Fuju. We could tell you about the other six,
but it would be too long a business; so we will say no more about them.

And now you have heard all the truth about Cathay and Manzi and many
other countries, as has been set down in this Book; the customs of the
people and the various objects of commerce, the beasts and birds, the
gold and silver and precious stones, and many other matters have been
rehearsed to you. But our Book as yet does not contain nearly all that
we purpose to put therein. For we have still to tell you all about the
people of India and the notable things of that country, which are well
worth the describing, for they are marvellous indeed. What we shall
tell is all true, and without any lies. And we shall set down all the
particulars in writing just as Messer Marco Polo related them. And he
well knew the facts, for he remained so long in India, and enquired so
diligently into the manners and peculiarities of the nations, that I
can assure you there never was a single man before who learned so much
and beheld so much as he did.


  NOTE 1.—The _Laurus_ (or _Cinnamomum_) _Camphora_, a large timber
  tree, grows abundantly in Fo-kien. A description of the manner in
  which camphor is produced at a very low cost, by sublimation from
  the chopped twigs, etc., will be found in the _Lettres Edifiantes_,
  XXIV. 19 _seqq._; and more briefly in _Hedde_ by _Rondot_, p. 35.
  Fo-kien alone has been known to send to Canton in one year 4000
  _piculs_ (of 133⅓ lbs. each), but the average is 2500 to 3000
  (_ib._).

  NOTE 2.—When Marco says Zayton is one of the _two_ greatest
  commercial ports in the world, I know not if he has another haven
  in his eye, or is only using an idiom of the age. For in like
  manner Friar Odoric calls Java “the _second best_ of all Islands
  that exist”; and Kansan (or Shen-si) the “_second best_ province in
  the world, and the best populated.” But apart from any such idiom,
  Ibn Batuta pronounces Zayton to be the greatest haven in the world.

  Martini relates that when one of the Emperors wanted to make war on
  Japan, the Province of Fo-kien offered to bridge the interval with
  their vessels!

  ZAYTON, as Martini and Deguignes conjectured, is T’SWAN-CHAU FU, or
  CHWAN-CHAU FU (written by French scholars _Thsiouan-tchéou-fou_),
  often called in our charts, etc., _Chinchew_, a famous seaport of
  Fo-kien about 100 miles in a straight line S.W. by S. of Fu-chau.
  Klaproth supposes that the name by which it was known to the
  Arabs and other Westerns was corrupted from an old Chinese name
  of the city, given in the Imperial Geography, viz. TSEU-T’UNG.[1]
  _Zaitún_ commended itself to Arabian ears, being the Arabic for
  an olive-tree (whence Jerusalem is called _Zaitúniyah_); but the
  corruption (if such it be) must be of very old date, as the city
  appears to have received its present name in the 7th or 8th century.

  Abulfeda, whose Geography was terminated in 1321, had heard the
  real name of Zayton: “_Shanju_” he calls it, “known in our time as
  Zaitún”; and again: “Zaitún, _i.e._ Shanju, is a haven of China,
  and, according to the accounts of merchants who have travelled to
  those parts, is a city of mark. It is situated on a marine estuary
  which ships enter from the China Sea. The estuary extends fifteen
  miles, and there is a river at the head of it. According to some
  who have seen the place, the tide flows. It is half a day from the
  sea, and the channel by which ships come up from the sea is of
  fresh water. It is smaller in size than Hamath, and has the remains
  of a wall which was destroyed by the Tartars. The people drink
  water from the channel, and also from wells.”

  Friar Odoric (in China, _circa_ 1323–1327, who travelled apparently
  by land from Chin-kalán, _i.e._ Canton) says: “Passing through many
  cities and towns, I came to a certain noble city which is called
  Zayton, where we Friars Minor have two Houses.... In this city is
  great plenty of all things that are needful for human subsistence.
  For example, you can get three pounds and eight ounces of sugar
  for less than half a groat. The city is twice as great as Bologna,
  and in it are many monasteries of devotees, idol-worshippers every
  man of them. In one of those monasteries which I visited there
  were 3000 monks.... The place is one of the best in the world....
  Thence I passed eastward to a certain city called Fuzo.... The
  city is a mighty fine one, and standeth upon the sea.” Andrew of
  Perugia, another Franciscan, was Bishop of Zayton from 1322, having
  resided there from 1318. In 1326 he writes a letter home, in which
  he speaks of the place as “a great city on the shores of the Ocean
  Sea, which is called in the Persian tongue _Cayton_ (Çayton); and
  in this city a rich Armenian lady did build a large and fine enough
  church, which was erected into a cathedral by the Archbishop,”
  and so on. He speaks incidentally of the Genoese merchants
  frequenting it. John Marignolli, who was there about 1347, calls
  it “a wondrous fine sea-port, and a city of incredible size, where
  our Minor Friars have three very fine churches; ... and they have
  a bath also, and a _fondaco_ which serves as a depôt for all the
  merchants.” Ibn Batuta about the same time says: “The first city
  that I reached after crossing the sea was ZAITÚN.... It is a great
  city, superb indeed; and in it they make damasks of velvet as well
  as those of satin (_Kimkhá_ and _Atlás_), which are called from the
  name of the city _Zatúníah_; they are superior to the stuffs of
  Khansá and Khánbálik. The harbour of Zaitún is one of the greatest
  in the world—I am wrong; it is _the_ greatest! I have seen there
  about an hundred first-class junks together; as for small ones,
  they were past counting. The harbour is formed by an estuary which
  runs inland from the sea until it joins the Great River.”

  [Mr. Geo. Phillips finds a strong argument in favour of Changchau
  being Zayton in this passage of Ibn Batuta. He says (_Jour. China
  Br. R. A. Soc._ 1888, 28–29): “Changchow in the Middle Ages was
  the seat of a great silk manufacture, and the production of its
  looms, such as gauzes, satins and velvets, were said to exceed in
  beauty those of Soochow and Hangchow. According to the _Fuhkien
  Gazetteer_, silk goods under the name of Kinki, and porcelain were,
  at the end of the Sung Dynasty, ordered to be taken abroad and to
  be bartered against foreign wares, treasure having been prohibited
  to leave the country. In this Kinki I think we may recognise the
  Kimkha of IBN BATUTA. I incline to this fact, as the characters
  Kinki are pronounced in the Amoy and Changchow dialects Khimkhi
  and Kimkhia. Anxious to learn if the manufacture of these silk
  goods still existed in Changchow, I communicated with the Rev.
  Dr. TALMAGE of Amoy, who, through the Rev. Mr. Ross of the London
  Mission, gave me the information that Kinki was formerly somewhat
  extensively manufactured at Changchow, although at present it
  was only made by one shop in that city. IBN BATUTA tells us that
  the King of China had sent to the Sultan, five hundred pieces of
  Kamkha, of which one hundred were made in the city of Zaitún. This
  form of present appears to have been continued by the Emperors of
  the Ming Dynasty, for we learn that the Emperor Yunglo gave to
  the Envoy of the Sultan of Quilon, presents of Kinki and Shalo,
  that is to say, brocaded silks and gauzes. Since writing the
  above, I found that Dr. HIRTH suggests that the characters Kinhua,
  meaning literally gold flower in the sense of silk embroidery,
  possibly represent the mediæval Khimka. I incline rather to my own
  suggestion. In the _Pei-wen-yun-fu_ these characters Kien-ki are
  frequently met in combination, meaning a silk texture, such as
  brocade or tapestry. Curtains made of this texture are mentioned
  in Chinese books, as early as the commencement of the Christian
  era.”—H. C.]

  Rashiduddin, in enumerating the Sings or great provincial
  governments of the empire, has the following: “7th FUCHÚ.—This
  is a city of Manzi. The Sing was formerly located at ZAITÚN,
  but afterwards established here, where it still remains. Zaitún
  is a great shipping-port, and the commandant there is Boháuddin
  Ḳandári.” Pauthier’s Chinese extracts show us that the seat of the
  _Sing_ was, in 1281, at T’swan-chau, but was then transferred to
  Fu-chau. In 1282 it was removed back to T’swan-chau, and in 1283
  recalled to Fu-chau. That is to say, what the Persian writer tells
  us of Fújú and Zayton, the Chinese Annalists tell us of Fu-chau and
  T’swan-chau. Therefore Fuju and Zayton were respectively Fu-chau
  and T’swan-chau.

  [In the _Yuen-shi_ (ch. 94), _Shi po_, Maritime trade regulations,
  it “is stated, among other things, that in 1277, a superintendency
  of foreign trade was established in Ts’uän-chou. Another
  superintendency was established for the three ports of K’ing-yüan
  (the present Ning-po), Shang-hai, and Gan-p’u. These three ports
  depended on the province of Fu-kien, the capital of which was
  Ts’üan-chou. Farther on, the ports of Hang-chou and Fu-chou are
  also mentioned in connection with foreign trade. Chang-chou (in
  Fu-kien, near Amoy) is only once spoken of there. We meet further
  the names of Wen-chou and Kuang-chou as seaports for foreign
  trade in the Mongol time. But Ts’üan-chou in this article on the
  sea-trade seems to be considered as the most important of the
  seaports, and it is repeatedly referred to. I have, therefore,
  no doubt that the port of Zayton of Western mediæval travellers
  can only be identified with Ts’uän-chou, not with Chang-chou....
  There are many other reasons found in Chinese works in favour of
  this view. Gan-p’u of the _Yuen-shi_ is the seaport Ganfu of Marco
  Polo.” (_Bretschneider, Med. Res._ I. pp. 186–187.)

  In his paper on _Changchow, the Capital of Fuhkien in Mongol
  Times_, printed in the _Jour. China B. R. A. Soc._ 1888, pp. 22–30,
  Mr. Geo. Phillips from Chinese works has shown that the Port of
  Chang-chau did, in Mongol times, alternate with Chinchew and
  Fu-chau as the capital of Fuh-kien.—H. C.]

  Further, Zayton was, as we see from this chapter, and from the
  2nd and 5th of Bk. III., in that age the great focus and harbour
  of communication with India and the Islands. From Zayton sailed
  Kúblái’s ill-fated expedition against Japan. From Zayton Marco
  Polo seems to have sailed on his return to the West, as did John
  Marignolli some half century later. At Zayton Ibn Batuta first
  landed in China, and from it he sailed on his return.

  All that we find quoted from Chinese records regarding
  _T’swan-chau_ corresponds to these Western statements regarding
  _Zayton_. For centuries T’swan-chau was the seat of the Customs
  Department of Fo-kien, nor was this finally removed till 1473.
  In all the historical notices of the arrival of ships and
  missions from India and the Indian Islands during the reign of
  Kúblái, T’swan-chau, and T’swan-chau almost alone, is the port of
  debarkation; in the notices of Indian regions in the annals of the
  same reign it is from T’swan-chau that the distances are estimated;
  it was from T’swan-chau that the expeditions against Japan and Java
  were mainly fitted out. (See quotations by Pauthier, pp. 559, 570,
  604, 653, 603, 643; _Gaubil_, 205, 217; _Deguignes_, III. 169, 175,
  180, 187; _Chinese Recorder_ (Foochow), 1870, pp. 45 _seqq._)

  When the Portuguese, in the 16th century, recovered China to
  European knowledge, Zayton was no longer the great haven of foreign
  trade; but yet the old name was not extinct among the mariners of
  Western Asia. Giovanni d’Empoli, in 1515, writing about China from
  Cochin, says: “Ships carry spices thither from these parts. Every
  year there go thither from Sumatra 60,000 cantars of pepper, and
  15,000 or 20,000 from Cochin and Malabar, worth 15 to 20 ducats a
  cantar; besides ginger (?), mace, nutmegs, incense, aloes, velvet,
  European goldwire, coral, woollens, etc. The Grand Can is the King
  of China, and he dwells at ZEITON.” Giovanni hoped to get to Zeiton
  before he died.[2]

  The port of T’swan-chau is generally called in our modern charts
  _Chinchew_. Now _Chincheo_ is the name given by the old Portuguese
  navigators to the coast of Fo-kien, as well as to the port which
  they frequented there, and till recently I supposed this to be
  T’swan-chau. But Mr. Phillips, in his paper alluded to at p.
  232, asserted that by _Chincheo_ modern Spaniards and Portuguese
  designated (not T’swan-chau but) _Chang-chau_, a great city 60
  miles W.S.W. of T’swan-chau, on a river entering Amoy Harbour. On
  turning, with this hint, to the old maps of the 17th century, I
  found that their Chincheo is really Chang-chau. But Mr. Phillips
  also maintains that Chang-chau, or rather its port, a place
  formerly called Gehkong and now Haiteng, is _Zayton_. Mr. Phillips
  does not adduce any precise evidence to show that this place was
  known as a port in Mongol times, far less that it was known as
  the most famous haven in the world; nor was I able to attach great
  weight to the arguments which he adduced. But his thesis, or a
  modification of it, has been taken up and maintained with more
  force, as already intimated, by the Rev. Dr. Douglas.

  The latter makes a strong point in the magnificent character of
  Amoy Harbour, which really is one of the grandest havens in the
  world, and thus answers better to the emphatic language of Polo,
  and of Ibn Batuta, than the river of T’swan-chau. All the rivers of
  Fo-kien, as I learn from Dr. Douglas himself, are rapidly silting
  up; and it is probable that the river of Chinchew presented, in
  the 13th and 14th centuries, a far more impressive aspect as a
  commercial basin than it does now. But still it must have been
  far below Amoy Harbour in magnitude, depth, and accessibility.
  I have before recognised this, but saw no way to reconcile the
  proposed deduction with the positive historical facts already
  stated, which absolutely (to my mind) identify the Zayton of Polo
  and Rashiduddin with the Chinese city and port of T’swan-chau.
  Dr. Douglas, however, points out that the whole northern shore
  of Amoy Harbour, with the Islands of Amoy and Quemoy, are within
  the Fu or Department of T’swan-chau; and the latter name would,
  in Chinese parlance, apply equally to the city and to any part of
  the department. He cites among other analogous cases the Treaty
  Port Neuchwang (in Liao-tong). That city really lies 20 miles up
  the Liao River, but the name of Neuchwang is habitually applied by
  foreigners to Ying-tzŭ, which is the actual port. Even now much
  of the trade of T’swan-chau merchants is carried on through Amoy,
  either by junks touching, or by using the shorter sea-passage to
  ’An-hai, which was once a port of great trade, and is only 20
  miles from T’swan-chau.[3] With such a haven as Amoy Harbour close
  by, it is improbable that Kúblái’s vast armaments would have made
  _rendezvous_ in the comparatively inconvenient port of T’swan-chau.
  Probably then the two were spoken of as one. In all this I
  recognise strong likelihood, and nothing inconsistent with recorded
  facts, or with Polo’s concise statements. It is even possible that
  (as Dr. Douglas thinks) Polo’s words intimate a distinction between
  Zayton the City and Zayton the Ocean Port; but for me Zayton the
  city, in Polo’s chapters, remains still T’swan-chau. Dr. Douglas,
  however, seems disposed to regard it as _Chang-chau_.

  The chief arguments urged for this last identity are: (1.) Ibn
  Batuta’s representation of his having embarked at Zayton “on
  the river,” _i.e._ on the internal navigation system of China,
  first for Sin-kalán (Canton), and afterwards for Kinsay. This
  could not, it is urged, be T’swan-chau, the river of which has no
  communication with the internal navigation, whereas the river at
  Chang-chau has such communication, constantly made use of in both
  directions (interrupted only by brief portages); (2.) Martini’s
  mention of the finding various Catholic remains, such as crosses
  and images of the Virgin, at Chang-chau, in the early part of the
  17th century, indicating that city as the probable site of the
  Franciscan establishments.

  [I remember that the argument brought forward by Mr. Phillips in
  favour of Changchow which most forcibly struck Sir H. Yule, was
  the finding of various Christian remains at this place, and Mr.
  Phillips wrote (_Jour. China Br. R. A. Soc._ 1888, 27–28): “We
  learn from the history of the Franciscan missions that two churches
  were built in Zaitun, one in the city and the other in a forest not
  far from the town. MARTINI makes mention of relics being found in
  the city of Changchow, and also of a missal which he tried in vain
  to purchase from its owner, who gave as a reason for not parting
  with it, that it had been in his family for several generations.
  According to the history of the Spanish Dominicans in China, ruins
  of churches were used in rebuilding the city walls, many of the
  stones having crosses cut on them.” Another singular discovery
  relating to these missions, is one mentioned by Father VITTORIO
  RICCI, which would seem to point distinctly to the remains of the
  Franciscan church built by ANDRÉ DE PÉROUSE outside the city of
  Zaitun: “The heathen of Changchow,” says RICCI, “found buried in a
  neighbouring hill called Saysou another cross of a most beautiful
  form cut out of a single block of stone, which I had the pleasure
  of placing in my church in that city. The heathen were alike
  ignorant of the time when it was made and how it came to be buried
  there.”—H. C.]

  [Illustration: SKETCH MAP of the GREAT PORTS OF FOKIEN to
    illustrate the Identity of Marco Polo’s ZAYTON.]

  Whether the application by foreigners of the term Zayton, may, by
  some possible change in trade arrangements in the quarter-century
  after Polo’s departure from China, have undergone a transfer, is
  a question which it would be vain to answer positively without
  further evidence. But as regards Polo’s Zayton, I continue in
  the belief that this was T’swan-chau _and its haven_, with the
  admission that this haven may probably have embraced that great
  basin called Amoy Harbour, or part of it.[4]

  [Besides the two papers I have already mentioned, the late Mr.
  Phillips has published, since the last edition of Marco Polo, in
  the _T’oung-Pao_, VI. and VII.: _Two Mediæval Fuh-kien Trading
  Ports: Chüan-chow and Chang-chow_. He has certainly given many
  proofs of the importance of Chang-chau at the time of the Mongol
  Dynasty, and one might well hesitate (I know it was also the
  feeling of Sir Henry Yule at the end of his life) between this
  city and T’swan-chau, but the weak point of his controversy is his
  theory about Fu-chau. However, Mr. George Phillips, who died in
  1896, gathered much valuable material, of which we have made use;
  it is only fair to pay this tribute to the memory of this learned
  consul.—H. C.]

  Martini (_circa_ 1650) describes T’swan-chau as delightfully
  situated on a promontory between two branches of the estuary which
  forms the harbour, and these so deep that the largest ships could
  come up to the walls on either side. A great suburb, Loyang, lay
  beyond the northern water, connected with the city by the most
  celebrated bridge in China. Collinson’s Chart in some points below
  the town gives only 1¼ fathom for the present depth, but Dr.
  Douglas tells me he has even now occasionally seen large junks come
  close to the city.

  Chinchew, though now occasionally visited by missionaries and
  others, is not a Treaty port, and we have not a great deal of
  information about its modern state. It is the head-quarters of the
  _T’i-tuh_, or general commanding the troops in Fo-kien. The walls
  have a circuit of 7 or 8 miles, but embracing much vacant ground.
  The chief exports now are tea and sugar, which are largely grown
  in the vicinity, tobacco, china-ware, nankeens, etc. There are
  still to be seen (as I learn from Mr. Phillips) the ruins of a fine
  mosque, said to have been founded by the Arab traders who resorted
  thither. The English Presbyterian Church Mission has had a chapel
  in the city for about ten years.

  Zayton, we have seen from Ibn Batuta’s report, was famed for
  rich satins called _Zaitúníah_. I have suggested in another
  work (_Cathay_, p. 486) that this may be the origin of our word
  _Satin_, through the _Zettani_ of mediæval Italian (or _Aceytuni_
  of mediæval Spanish). And I am more strongly disposed to support
  this, seeing that Francisque-Michel, in considering the origin of
  _Satin_, hesitates between _Satalin_ from Satalia in Asia Minor
  and _Soudanin_ from the Soudan or Sultan; neither half so probable
  as _Zaituni_. I may add that in a French list of charges of 1352
  we find the intermediate form _Zatony_. _Satin_ in the modern form
  occurs in Chaucer:—

      “In Surrie whilom dwelt a compagnie
       Of chapmen rich, and therto sad and trewe,
       That widë where senten their spicerie,
       Clothes of gold, and _satins_ riche of hewe.”
                        —_Man of Lawe’s Tale_, st. 6.

  [Hatzfeld (_Dict._) derives _satin_ from the Italian _setino_; and
  _setino_ from SETA, pig’s hair, and gives the following example:
  “Deux aunes et un quartier de satin vremeil,” in _Caffiaux,
  Abattis de maisons à Gommegnies_, p. 17, 14th century. The
  Portuguese have _setim_. But I willingly accept Sir Henry Yule’s
  suggestion that the origin of the word is Zayton; cf. _zeitun_
  زيتون olive.

  “The King [of Bijánagar] ... was clothed in a robe of _zaitún_
  satin.” (_Elliot_, IV. p. 113, who adds in a note _zaitún_:
  Olive-coloured?) And again (_Ibid._ p. 120): “Before the throne
  there was placed a cushion of _zaitúni_ satin, round which three
  rows of the most exquisite pearls were sewn.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—We have referred in a former note (ch. lxxvii. note 7) to
  an apparent change in regard to the Chinese consumption of pepper,
  which is now said to be trifling. We shall see in the first chapter
  of Bk. III. that Polo estimates the tonnage of Chinese junks by
  the number of baskets of pepper they carried, and we have seen in
  last note the large estimate by Giov. d’Empoli of the quantity that
  went to China in 1515. Galvano also, speaking of the adventure of
  Fernão Perez d’Andrade to China in 1517, says that he took in at
  Pacem a cargo of pepper, “as being the chief article of trade that
  is valued in China.” And it is evident from what Marsden says in
  his _History of Sumatra_, that in the last century some tangible
  quantity was still sent to China. The export from the Company’s
  plantations in Sumatra averaged 1200 tons, of which the greater
  part came to Europe, _the rest_ went to China.

  [Couto says also: “Os portos principaes do Reyno da Sunda são
  Banta, Aché, Xacatara, por outro nome Caravão, aos quaes vam
  todos os annos mui perto de vinte sommas, que são embarcações do
  Chincheo, huma das Provincias maritimas da China, a carregar de
  pimenta, porque dá este Reyno todos os annos oito mil bares della,
  que são trinta mil quintaes.” (_Decada_ IV. Liv. III. Cap. I. 167.)]

  NOTE 4.—These tattooing artists were probably employed mainly
  by mariners frequenting the port. We do not know if the Malays
  practised tattooing before their conversion to Islam. But most
  Indo-Chinese races tattoo, and the Japanese still “have the greater
  part of the body and limbs scrolled over with bright-blue dragons,
  and lions, and tigers, and figures of men and women tattooed into
  their skins with the most artistic and elaborate ornamentation.”
  (_Alcock_, I. 191.) Probably the Arab sailors also indulged in the
  same kind of decoration. It is common among the Arab women now, and
  Della Valle speaks of it as in his time so much in vogue among both
  sexes through Egypt, Arabia, and Babylonia, that _he_ had not been
  able to escape. (I. 395.)

  NOTE 5.—The divergence in Ramusio’s version is here very notable:
  “The River which enters the Port of Zayton is great and wide,
  running with great velocity, and is a branch of that which flows
  by the city of Kinsay. And at the place where it quits the main
  channel is the city of Tingui, of which all that is to be said is
  that there they make porcelain basins and dishes. The manner of
  making porcelain was thus related to him. They excavate a certain
  kind of earth, as it were from a mine, and this they heap into
  great piles, and then leave it undisturbed and exposed to wind,
  rain, and sun for 30 or 40 years. In this space of time the earth
  becomes sufficiently refined for the manufacture of porcelain; they
  then colour it at their discretion, and bake it in a furnace. Those
  who excavate the clay do so always therefore for their sons and
  grandsons. The articles are so cheap in that city that you get 8
  bowls for a Venice groat.”

  Ibn Batuta speaks of porcelain as manufactured at Zayton; indeed he
  says positively (and wrongly): “Porcelain is made nowhere in China
  except in the cities of Zaitun and Sinkalan” (Canton). A good
  deal of China ware in modern times _is_ made in Fo-kien and Canton
  provinces, and it is still an article of export from T’swan-chau
  and Amoy; but it is only of a very ordinary kind. Pakwiha, between
  Amoy and Chang-chau, is mentioned in the _Chinese Commercial
  Guide_ (p. 114) as now the place where the coarse blue ware, so
  largely exported to India, etc., is largely manufactured; and
  Phillips mentions Tung-’an (about half-way between T’swan-chau and
  Chang-chau) as a great seat of this manufacture.

  Looking, however, to the Ramusian interpolations, which do not
  indicate a locality necessarily near Zayton, or even in Fo-kien, it
  is possible that Murray is right in supposing the place intended
  _in these_ to be really _King-tê chên_ in Kiang-si, the great seat
  of the manufacture of genuine porcelain, or rather its chief mart
  JAU-CHAU FU on the P’o-yang Lake.

  The geographical indication of this city of porcelain, as at the
  place where a branch of the River of Kinsay flows off towards
  Zayton, points to a notion prevalent in the Middle Ages as to the
  interdivergence of rivers in general, and especially of Chinese
  rivers. This notion will be found well embodied in the Catalan Map,
  and something like it in the maps of the Chinese themselves;[5] it
  is a ruling idea with Ibn Batuta, who, as we have seen (in note 2),
  speaks of the River of Zayton as connected in the interior with
  “the Great River,” and who travels by this waterway accordingly
  from Zayton to Kinsay, taking no notice of the mountains of
  Fo-kien. So also (_supra_, p. 175) Rashiduddin had been led to
  suppose that the Great Canal extended to Zayton. With apparently
  the same idea of one Great River of China with many ramifications,
  Abulfeda places most of the great cities of China upon “The River.”
  The “Great River of China,” with its branches to Kinsay, is alluded
  to in a like spirit by Wassáf (_supra_, p. 213). Polo has already
  indicated the same idea (p. 219).

  Assuming this as the notion involved in the passage from Ramusio,
  the position of _Jau-chau_ might be fairly described as that of
  Tingui is therein, standing as it does on the P’o-yang Lake, from
  which there is such a ramification of internal navigation, _e.g._
  to Kinsay or Hang-chau fu directly by Kwansin, the Chang-shan
  portage already referred to (_supra_, p. 222), and the Ts’ien T’ang
  (and this is the Kinsay River line to which I imagine Polo here to
  refer), or circuitously by the Yang-tzŭ and Great Canal; to Canton
  by the portage of the Meiling Pass; and to the cities of Fo-kien
  either by the Kwansin River or by Kian-chan fu, further south, with
  a portage in each case across the Fo-kien mountains. None of our
  maps give any idea of the extent of internal navigation in China.
  (See _Klaproth, Mém_. vol. iii.)

  The story of the life-long period during which the porcelain clay
  was exposed to temper long held its ground, and probably was only
  dispelled by the publication of the details of the King-tê chên
  manufacture by Père d’Entrecolles in the _Lettres Edifiantes_.

  NOTE 6.—The meagre statement in the French texts shows merely
  that Polo had heard of the Fo-kien dialect. The addition from
  Ramusio shows further that he was aware of the unity of the written
  character throughout China, but gives no indication of knowledge
  of its peculiar principles, nor of the extent of difference in the
  spoken dialects. Even different districts of Fo-kien, according to
  Martini, use dialects so different that they understand each other
  with difficulty (108).

  [Mendoza already said: “It is an admirable thing to consider how
  that in that kingdome they doo speake manie languages, the one
  differing from the other: yet generallie in writing they doo
  understand one the other, and in speaking not.” (_Parke’s Transl._
  p. 93.)]

  Professor Kidd, speaking of his instructors in the Mandarin and
  Fo-kien dialects respectively, says: “The teachers in both cases
  read the same books, composed in the same style, and attached
  precisely the same ideas to the written symbols, but could not
  understand each other in conversation.” Moreover, besides these
  sounds attaching to the Chinese characters when read in the dialect
  of Fo-kien, thus discrepant from the sounds used in reading the
  same characters in the Mandarin dialect, yet _another_ class of
  sounds is used to express the same ideas in the Fo-kien dialect
  when it is used colloquially and without reference to written
  symbols! (_Kidd’s China_, etc., pp. 21–23.)

  The term _Fokien dialect_ in the preceding passage is ambiguous,
  as will be seen from the following remarks, which have been
  derived from the Preface and Appendices to the Rev. Dr. Douglas’s
  Dictionary of the Spoken Language of Amoy,[6] and which throw a
  distinct light on the subject of this note:—

  “The vernacular or spoken language of Amoy is not a mere colloquial
  dialect or _patois_, it is a _distinct language_—one of the many
  and widely differing spoken languages which divide among them
  the soil of China. For these spoken languages are not _dialects_
  of one language, but cognate languages, bearing to each other a
  relation similar to that between Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac, or
  between English, Dutch, German, and Danish. The so-called ‘_written
  language_’ is indeed uniform throughout the whole country, but that
  is rather a _notation_ than a language. And this written language,
  as read aloud from books, is not _spoken_ in any place whatever,
  under any form of pronunciation. The most learned men never employ
  it as a means of ordinary oral communication even among themselves.
  It is, in fact, a _dead language_, related to the various spoken
  languages of China, somewhat as Latin is to the languages of
  Southern Europe.

  “Again: Dialects, properly speaking, of the Amoy vernacular
  language are found (_e.g._) in the neighbouring districts of
  Changchew, Chinchew, and Tungan, and the language with its
  subordinate dialects is believed to be spoken by 8 or 10 millions
  of people. Of the other languages of China the most nearly related
  to the Amoy is the vernacular of Chau-chau-fu, often called ‘the
  Swatow dialect,’ from the only treaty-port in that region. The
  ancestors of the people speaking it emigrated many years ago from
  Fuh-kien, and are still distinguished there by the appellation
  _Hok-ló_, _i.e._ people from Hok-kien (or Fuh-kien). This language
  differs from the Amoy, much as Dutch differs from German, or
  Portuguese from Spanish.

  “In the Island of Hai-nan (Hái-lâm), again (setting aside the
  central aborigines), a language is spoken which differs from Amoy
  more than that of Swatow, but is more nearly related to these two
  than to any other of the languages of China.

  “In Fuh-chau fu we have another language which is largely spoken
  in the centre and north of Fuh-kien. This has many points of
  resemblance to the Amoy, but is quite unintelligible to the Amoy
  people, with the exception of an occasional word or phrase.

  “Hing-hwa fu (Heng-hoà), between Fuh-chau and Chinchew, has also a
  language of its own, though containing only two _Hien_ districts.
  It is alleged to be unintelligible both at Amoy and at Fuhchau.

  “To the other languages of China that of Amoy is less closely
  related; yet all evidently spring from one common stock. But that
  common stock is _not_ the modern Mandarin dialect, but the ancient
  form of the Chinese language as spoken some 3000 years ago. The
  so-called _Mandarin_, far from being the original form, is usually
  more changed than any. It is in the ancient form of the language
  (naturally) that the relation of Chinese to other languages can
  best be traced; and as the Amoy vernacular, which very generally
  retains the final consonants in their original shape, has been one
  of the chief sources from which the ancient form of Chinese has
  been recovered, the study of that vernacular is of considerable
  importance.”

  NOTE 7.—This is inconsistent with his former statements as to the
  supreme wealth of Kinsay. But with Marco the subject in hand is
  always _pro magnifico_.

  Ramusio says that the Traveller will now “begin to speak of the
  territories, cities, and provinces of the Greater, Lesser, and
  Middle India, in which regions he was when in the service of the
  Great Kaan, being sent thither on divers matters of business. And
  then again when he returned to the same quarter with the queen of
  King Argon, and with his father and uncle, on his way back to his
  native land. So he will relate the strange things that he saw in
  those Indies, not omitting others which he heard related by persons
  of reputation and worthy of credit, and things that were pointed
  out to him on the maps of manners of the Indies aforesaid.”

[1] Dr. C. Douglas objects to this derivation of _Zayton_, that
    the place was never called _Tseut’ung_ absolutely, but
    _T’seu-t’ung-ching_, “city of prickly T’ung-trees”; and this not as
    a name, but as a polite literary epithet, somewhat like “City of
    Palaces” applied to Calcutta.

[2] Giovanni did not get to Zayton; but two years later he got to
    Canton with Fernão Perez, was sent ashore as Factor, and a few days
    after died of fever. (De Barros, III. II. viii.) The way in which
    Botero, a compiler in the latter part of the 16th century, speaks
    of Zayton as between Canton and Liampo (Ningpo), and exporting
    immense quantities of porcelain, salt and sugar, looks as if he
    had before him modern information as to the place. He likewise
    observes, “All the moderns note the port of Zaiton between Canton
    and Liampo.” Yet I know no other modern allusion except Giovanni
    d’Empoli’s; and that was printed only a few years ago. (_Botero,

These ships, you must know, are of fir timber.{1} They have but one
deck, though each of them contains some 50 or 60 cabins, wherein
the merchants abide greatly at their ease, every man having one to
himself. The ship hath but one rudder, but it hath four masts; and
sometimes they have two additional masts, which they ship and unship at
pleasure.{2}

[Moreover the larger of their vessels have some thirteen compartments
or severances in the interior, made with planking strongly framed, in
case mayhap the ship should spring a leak, either by running on a rock
or by the blow of a hungry whale (as shall betide ofttimes, for when
the ship in her course by night sends a ripple back alongside of the
whale, the creature seeing the foam fancies there is something to eat
afloat, and makes a rush forward, whereby it often shall stave in
some part of the ship). In such case the water that enters the leak
flows to the bilge, which is always kept clear; and the mariners having
ascertained where the damage is, empty the cargo from that compartment
into those adjoining, for the planking is so well fitted that the water
cannot pass from one compartment to another. They then stop the leak
and replace the lading.{3}]

The fastenings are all of good iron nails and the sides are double, one
plank laid over the other, and caulked outside and in. The planks are
not pitched, for those people do not have any pitch, but they daub the
sides with another matter, deemed by them far better than pitch; it
is this. You see they take some lime and some chopped hemp, and these
they knead together with a certain wood-oil; and when the three are
thoroughly amalgamated, they hold like any glue. And with this mixture
they do paint their ships.{4}

Each of their great ships requires at least 200 mariners [some of them
300]. They are indeed of great size, for one ship shall carry 5000 or
6000 baskets of pepper [and they used formerly to be larger than they
are now]. And aboard these ships, you must know, when there is no wind
they use sweeps, and these sweeps are so big that to pull them requires
four mariners to each.{5} Every great ship has certain large barks or
tenders attached to it; these are large enough to carry 1000 baskets of
pepper, and carry 50 or 60 mariners apiece [some of them 80 or 100],
and they are likewise moved by oars; they assist the great ship by
towing her, at such times as her sweeps are in use [or even when she
is under sail, if the wind be somewhat on the beam; not if the wind be
astern, for then the sails of the big ship would take the wind out of
those of the tenders, and she would run them down]. Each ship has two
[or three] of these barks, but one is bigger than the others. There
are also some ten [small] boats for the service of each great ship, to
lay out the anchors, catch fish, bring supplies aboard, and the like.
When the ship is under sail she carries these boats slung to her sides.
And the large tenders have their boats in like manner.

When the ship has been a year in work and they wish to repair her,
they nail on a third plank over the first two, and caulk and pay it
well; and when another repair is wanted they nail on yet another plank,
and so on year by year as it is required. Howbeit, they do this only
for a certain number of years, and till there are six thicknesses of
planking. When a ship has come to have six planks on her sides, one
over the other, they take her no more on the high seas, but make use
of her for coasting as long as she will last, and then they break her
up.{6}

Now that I have told you about the ships which sail upon the Ocean Sea
and among the Isles of India, let us proceed to speak of the various
wonders of India; but first and foremost I must tell you about a number
of Islands that there are in that part of the Ocean Sea where we now
are, I mean the Islands lying to the eastward. So let us begin with an
Island which is called Chipangu.


  NOTE 1.—Pine [_Pinus sinensis_] is [still] the staple timber for
  ship-building both at Canton and in Fo-kien. There is a very large
  export of it from Fu-chau, and even the chief fuel at that city
  is from a kind of fir. Several varieties of pine-wood are also
  brought down the rivers for sale at Canton. (_N. and Q._, _China
  and Japan_, I. 170; _Fortune_, I. 286; _Doolittle_.)

  NOTE 2.—Note the _one rudder_ again. (_Supra_, Bk. I. ch. xix.
  note 3.) One of the shifting masts was probably a bowsprit, which,
  according to Lecomte, the Chinese occasionally use, very slight,
  and planted on the larboard bow.

  NOTE 3.—The system of water-tight compartments, for the description
  of which we have to thank Ramusio’s text, in our own time
  introduced into European construction, is still maintained by the
  Chinese, not only in sea-going junks, but in the larger river
  craft. (See _Mid. Kingd._ II. 25; _Blakiston_, 88; _Deguignes_, I.
  204–206.)

  NOTE 4.—This still remains quite correct, hemp, old nets, and the
  fibre of a certain creeper being used for oakum. The _wood-oil_ is
  derived from a tree called _Tong-shu_, I do not know if identical
  with the wood-oil trees of Arakan and Pegu (_Dipterocarpus laevis_).

  [“What goes under the name of ‘wood-oil’ to-day in China is the
  poisonous oil obtained from the nuts of _Elæococca verrucosa_. It
  is much used for painting and caulking ships.” (_Bretschneider,
  Hist. of Bot. Disc._ I. p. 4.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 5.—The junks that visit Singapore still use these sweeps. (_J.
  Ind. Arch._ II. 607.) Ibn Batuta puts a much larger number of men
  to each. It will be seen from his account below that great ropes
  were attached to the oars to pull by, the bulk of timber being too
  large to grasp; as in the old French galleys wooden _manettes_ or
  grips, were attached to the oar for the same purpose.

  NOTE 6.—The Chinese sea-going vessels of those days were apparently
  larger than was at all common in European navigation. Marco here
  speaks of 200 (or in Ramusio up to 300) mariners, a large crew
  indeed for a merchant vessel, but not so great as is implied in
  Odoric’s statement, that the ship in which he went from India to
  China had 700 souls on board. The numbers carried by Chinese junks
  are occasionally still enormous. “In February, 1822, Captain Pearl,
  of the English ship _Indiana_, coming through Caspar Straits,
  fell in with the cargo and crew of a wrecked junk, and saved 198
  persons out of 1600, with whom she had left Amoy, whom he landed
  at Pontianak. This humane act cost him 11,000_l._” (Quoted by
  _Williams_ from _Chin. Rep._ VI. 149.)

  The following are some other mediæval accounts of the China
  shipping, all unanimous as to the main facts.

  _Friar Jordanus_:—“The vessels which they navigate to Cathay be
  very big, and have upon the ship’s hull more than one hundred
  cabins, and with a fair wind they carry ten sails, and they are
  very bulky, being made of three thicknesses of plank, so that the
  first thickness is as in our great ships, the second crosswise, the
  third again longwise. In sooth, ’tis a very strong affair!” (55.)

  _Nicolo Conti_:—“They build some ships much larger than ours,
  capable of containing 2000 butts (_vegetes_), with five masts and
  five sails. The lower part is constructed with triple planking,
  in order to withstand the force of the tempests to which they are
  exposed. And the ships are divided into compartments, so formed
  that if one part be shattered the rest remains in good order, and
  enables the vessel to complete its voyage.”

  _Ibn Batuta_:—“Chinese ships only are used in navigating the sea
  of China.... There are three classes of these: (1) the Large,
  which are called _Jonúk_ (sing. _Junk_); (2) the Middling, which
  are called _Zao_; and (3) the Small, called _Kakam_. Each of the
  greater ships has from twelve sails down to three. These are made
  of bamboo laths woven into a kind of mat; they are never lowered,
  and they are braced this way and that as the wind may blow. When
  these vessels anchor the sails are allowed to fly loose. Each ship
  has a crew of 1000 men, viz. 600 mariners and 400 soldiers, among
  whom are archers, target-men, and cross-bow men to shoot naphtha.
  Each large vessel is attended by three others, which are called
  respectively ‘The Half,’ ‘The Third,’ and ‘The Quarter.’ These
  vessels are built only at Zayton, in China, and at Sínkalán or
  Sín-ul-Sín (_i.e._ Canton). This is the way they are built. They
  construct two walls of timber, which they connect by very thick
  slabs of wood, clenching all fast this way and that with huge
  spikes, each of which is three cubits in length. When the two walls
  have been united by these slabs they apply the bottom planking,
  and then launch the hull before completing the construction. The
  timbers projecting from the sides towards the water serve the crew
  for going down to wash and for other needs. And to these projecting
  timbers are attached the oars, which are like masts in size, and
  need from 10 to 15 men[1] to ply each of them. There are about 20
  of these great oars, and the rowers at each oar stand in two ranks
  facing one another. The oars are provided with two strong cords or
  cables; each rank pulls at one of these and then lets go, whilst
  the other rank pulls on the opposite cable. These rowers have a
  pleasant chaunt at their work usually, singing Lá’ la! Lá’ la![2]
  The three tenders which we have mentioned above also use oars, and
  tow the great ships when required.

  “On each ship four decks are constructed; and there are cabins and
  public rooms for the merchants. Some of these cabins are provided
  with closets and other conveniences, and they have keys so that
  their tenants can lock them, and carry with them their wives or
  concubines. The crew in some of the cabins have their children,
  and they sow kitchen herbs, ginger, etc., in wooden buckets. The
  captain is a very great Don; and when he lands, the archers and
  negro-slaves march before him with javelins, swords, drums, horns,
  and trumpets.” (IV. pp. 91 _seqq._ and 247 _seqq._ combined.)
  Comparing this very interesting description with Polo’s, we see
  that they agree in all essentials except size and the number of
  decks. It is not unlikely that the revival of the trade with India,
  which Kúblái stimulated, may have in its development under his
  successors led to the revival also of the larger ships of former
  times to which Marco alludes.

                              CHAPTER II.

      DESCRIPTION OF THE ISLAND OF CHIPANGU, AND THE GREAT KAAN’S
                    DESPATCH OF A HOST AGAINST IT.


Chipangu is an Island towards the east in the high seas, 1500 miles
distant from the Continent; and a very great Island it is.{1}

The people are white, civilized, and well-favoured. They are Idolaters,
and are dependent on nobody. And I can tell you the quantity of gold
they have is endless; for they find it in their own Islands, [and the
King does not allow it to be exported. Moreover] few merchants visit
the country because it is so far from the main land, and thus it comes
to pass that their gold is abundant beyond all measure.{2}

I will tell you a wonderful thing about the Palace of the Lord of that
Island. You must know that he hath a great Palace which is entirely
roofed with fine gold, just as our churches are roofed with lead,
insomuch that it would scarcely be possible to estimate its value.
Moreover, all the pavement of the Palace, and the floors of its
chambers, are entirely of gold, in plates like slabs of stone, a good
two fingers thick; and the windows also are of gold, so that altogether
the richness of this Palace is past all bounds and all belief.{3}

[Illustration: Ancient Japanese Emperor. (After a Native Drawing; from
  Humbert.)]

They have also pearls in abundance, which are of a rose colour, but
fine, big, and round, and quite as valuable as the white ones. [In this
Island some of the dead are buried, and others are burnt. When a body
is burnt, they put one of these pearls in the mouth, for such is their
custom.] They have also quantities of other precious stones.{4}

Cublay, the Grand Kaan who now reigneth, having heard much of the
immense wealth that was in this Island, formed a plan to get possession
of it. For this purpose he sent two of his Barons with a great navy,
and a great force of horse and foot. These Barons were able and valiant
men, one of them called ABACAN and the other VONSAINCHIN, and they
weighed with all their company from the ports of Zayton and Kinsay, and
put out to sea. They sailed until they reached the Island aforesaid,
and there they landed, and occupied the open country and the villages,
but did not succeed in getting possession of any city or castle. And so
a disaster befel them, as I shall now relate.

You must know that there was much ill-will between those two Barons, so
that one would do nothing to help the other. And it came to pass that
there arose a north wind which blew with great fury, and caused great
damage along the coasts of that Island, for its harbours were few. It
blew so hard that the Great Kaan’s fleet could not stand against it.
And when the chiefs saw that, they came to the conclusion that if the
ships remained where they were the whole navy would perish. So they all
got on board and made sail to leave the country. But when they had gone
about four miles they came to a small Island, on which they were driven
ashore in spite of all they could do; and a large part of the fleet was
wrecked, and a great multitude of the force perished, so that there
escaped only some 30,000 men, who took refuge on this Island.

These held themselves for dead men, for they were without food, and
knew not what to do, and they were in great despair when they saw
that such of the ships as had escaped the storm were making full sail
for their own country without the slightest sign of turning back to
help them. And this was because of the bitter hatred between the two
Barons in command of the force; for the Baron who escaped never showed
the slightest desire to return to his colleague who was left upon the
Island in the way you have heard; though he might easily have done so
after the storm ceased; and it endured not long. He did nothing of the
kind, however, but made straight for home. And you must know that the
Island to which the soldiers had escaped was uninhabited; there was not
a creature upon it but themselves.

Now we will tell you what befel those who escaped on the fleet, and
also those who were left upon the Island.


  NOTE 1.—✛CHIPANGU represents the Chinese _Jih-pên-kwé_, the kingdom
  of Japan, the name Jih-pên being the Chinese pronunciation, of
  which the term _Nippon_, _Niphon_ or _Nihon_, used in Japan, is
  a dialectic variation, both meaning “the origin of the sun,” or
  sun-rising, the place the sun comes from. The name _Chipangu_ is
  used also by Rashiduddin. Our _Japan_ was probably taken from the
  Malay _Japún_ or _Japáng_.

  [“The name _Nihon_ (‘Japan’) seems to have been first officially
  employed by the Japanese Government in A.D. 670. Before that time,
  the usual native designation of the country was _Yamato_, properly
  the name of one of the central provinces. Yamato and _Ō-mi-kuni_,
  that is, ‘the Great August Country,’ are the names still preferred
  in poetry and _belles-lettres_. Japan has other ancient names, some
  of which are of learned length and thundering sound, for instance,
  _Toyo-ashi-wara-no-chi-aki-no-naga-i-ho-aki-no-mizu-ho-no-kuni_,
  that is ‘the Luxuriant-Reed-Plains-the-Land-of-Fresh-Rice-Ears-of-
  a-Thousand-Autumns-of-Long-Five-Hundred-Autumns.’” (_B. H.
  Chamberlain_, _Things Japanese_, 3rd ed. p. 222.)—H. C.]

  It is remarkable that the name _Nipon_ occurs, in the form of
  _Al-Náfún_, in the _Ikhwán-al-Safá_, supposed to date from the 10th
  century. (See _J. A. S. B._ XVII. Pt. I. 502.)

  [I shall merely mention the strange theory of Mr. George
  Collingridge that _Zipangu_ is Java and not Japan in his paper on
  _The Early Cartography of Japan_. (_Geog. Jour._ May, 1894, pp.
  403–409.) Mr. F. G. Kramp (_Japan or Java?_), in the _Tijdschrift
  v. het K. Nederl. Aardrijkskundig Genootschap_, 1894, and Mr. H.
  Yule Oldham (_Geog. Jour._, September, 1894, pp. 276–279), have
  fully replied to this paper.—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—The causes briefly mentioned in the text maintained the
  abundance and low price of gold in Japan till the recent opening of
  the trade. (See Bk. II. ch. 1. note 5.) Edrisi had heard that gold
  in the isles of Sila (or Japan) was so abundant that dog-collars
  were made of it.

  NOTE 3.—This was doubtless an old “yarn,” repeated from generation
  to generation. We find in a Chinese work quoted by Amyot: “The
  palace of the king (of Japan) is remarkable for its singular
  construction. It is a vast edifice, of extraordinary height; it has
  nine stories, and presents on all sides an exterior shining with
  the purest gold.” (_Mém. conc. les Chinois_, XIV. 55.) See also a
  like story in Kaempfer. (_H. du Japon_, I. 139.)

  [Illustration: Ancient Japanese Archer. (From a Native Drawing.)]

  NOTE 4.—Kaempfer speaks of pearls being found in considerable
  numbers, chiefly about Satsuma, and in the Gulf of Omura, in
  Kiusiu. From what Alcock says they do not seem now to be abundant.
  (_Ib._ I. 95; _Alcock_, I. 200.) No precious stones are mentioned
  by Kaempfer.

  Rose-tinted pearls are frequent among the Scotch pearls, and,
  according to Mr. King, those of this tint are of late the most
  highly esteemed in Paris. Such pearls were perhaps also most highly
  esteemed in old India; for red pearls (_Lohitamukti_) form one
  of the seven precious objects which it was incumbent to use in
  the adornment of Buddhistic reliquaries, and to distribute at the
  building of a Dagoba. (_Nat. Hist. of Prec. Stones_, etc., 263;

                             CHAPTER III.

       WHAT FURTHER CAME OF THE GREAT KAAN’S EXPEDITION AGAINST
                               CHIPANGU.


You see those who were left upon the Island, some 30,000 souls, as I
have said, did hold themselves for dead men, for they saw no possible
means of escape. And when the King of the Great Island got news how the
one part of the expedition had saved themselves upon that Isle, and
the other part was scattered and fled, he was right glad thereat, and
he gathered together all the ships of his territory and proceeded with
them, the sea now being calm, to the little Isle, and landed his troops
all round it. And when the Tartars saw them thus arrive, and the whole
force landed, without any guard having been left on board the ships
(the act of men very little acquainted with such work), they had the
sagacity to feign flight. [Now the Island was very high in the middle,
and whilst the enemy were hastening after them by one road they fetched
a compass by another and] in this way managed to reach the enemy’s
ships and to get aboard of them. This they did easily enough, for they
encountered no opposition.

Once they were on board they got under weigh immediately for the great
Island, and landed there, carrying with them the standards and banners
of the King of the Island; and in this wise they advanced to the
capital. The garrison of the city, suspecting nothing wrong, when they
saw their own banners advancing supposed that it was their own host
returning, and so gave them admittance. The Tartars as soon as they had
got in seized all the bulwarks and drove out all who were in the place
except the pretty women, and these they kept for themselves. In this
way the Great Kaan’s people got possession of the city.

When the King of the great Island and his army perceived that both
fleet and city were lost, they were greatly cast down; howbeit, they
got away to the great Island on board some of the ships which had not
been carried off. And the King then gathered all his host to the siege
of the city, and invested it so straitly that no one could go in or
come out. Those who were within held the place for seven months, and
strove by all means to send word to the Great Kaan; but it was all in
vain, they never could get the intelligence carried to him. So when
they saw they could hold out no longer they gave themselves up, on
condition that their lives should be spared, but still that they should
never quit the Island. And this befel in the year of our Lord 1279.{1}
The Great Kaan ordered the Baron who had fled so disgracefully to lose
his head. And afterwards he caused the other also, who had been left
on the Island, to be put to death, for he had never behaved as a good
soldier ought to do.{2}

But I must tell you a wonderful thing that I had forgotten, which
happened on this expedition.

You see, at the beginning of the affair, when the Kaan’s people had
landed on the great Island and occupied the open country as I told you,
they stormed a tower belonging to some of the islanders who refused to
surrender, and they cut off the heads of all the garrison except eight;
on these eight they found it impossible to inflict any wound! Now this
was by virtue of certain stones which they had in their arms inserted
between the skin and the flesh, with such skill as not to show at all
externally. And the charm and virtue of these stones was such that
those who wore them could never perish by steel. So when the Barons
learned this they ordered the men to be beaten to death with clubs.
And after their death the stones were extracted from the bodies of all,
and were greatly prized.{3}

Now the story of the discomfiture of the Great Kaan’s folk came to pass
as I have told you. But let us have done with that matter, and return
to our subject.


  NOTE 1.—Kúblái had long hankered after the conquest of Japan,
  or had at least, after his fashion, desired to obtain an
  acknowledgment of supremacy from the Japanese sovereign. He had
  taken steps in this view as early as 1266, but entirely without
  success. The fullest accessible particulars respecting his efforts
  are contained in the Japanese Annals translated by Titsing; and
  these are in complete accordance with the Chinese histories as
  given by Gaubil, De Mailla, and in Pauthier’s extracts, so far as
  these three latter enter into particulars. But it seems clear from
  the comparison that the Japanese chronicler had the Chinese Annals
  in his hands.

  In 1268, 1269, 1270, and 1271, Kúblái’s efforts were repeated to
  little purpose, and, provoked at this, in 1274, he sent a fleet of
  300 vessels with 15,000 men against Japan. This was defeated near
  the Island of Tsushima with heavy loss.

  Nevertheless Kúblái seems in the following years to have renewed
  his attempts at negotiation. The Japanese patience was exhausted,
  and, in 1280, they put one of his ambassadors to death.

  “As soon as the Moko (Mongols) heard of this, they assembled
  a considerable army to conquer Japan. When informed of their
  preparations, the Dairi sent ambassadors to Ize and other temples
  to invoke the gods. Fosiono Toki Mune, who resided at Kama Kura,
  ordered troops to assemble at Tsukuzi (_Tsikouzen_ of Alcock’s
  Map), and sent ... numerous detachments to Miyako to guard the
  Dairi and the Togou (Heir Apparent) against all danger.... In the
  first moon (of 1281) the Mongols named Asikan (Ngo Tsa-han[1]),
  Fan-bunko (Fan Wen-hu), Kinto (Hintu), and Kosakio (Hung
  Cha-khieu), Generals of their army, which consisted of 100,000 men,
  and was embarked on numerous ships of war. Asikan fell ill on the
  passage, and this made the second General (Fan Wen-hu) undecided as
  to his course.

  “_7th Month_. The entire fleet arrived at the Island of Firando
  (P’hing-hu), and passed thence to Goriosan (Ulungshan). The troops
  of Tsukuzi were under arms. _1st_ of _3rd Month_. A frightful storm
  arose; the Mongol ships foundered or were sorely shattered. The
  General (Fan Wen-hu) fled with the other Generals on the vessels
  that had least suffered; nobody has ever heard what became of them.
  The army of 100,000 men, which had landed below Goriosan, wandered
  about for three days without provisions; and the soldiers began to
  plan the building of vessels in which they might escape to China.

  “_7th day_. The Japanese army invested and attacked them with
  great vigour. The Mongols were totally defeated. 30,000 of them
  were made prisoners and conducted to Fakata (the _Fokouoka_ of
  Alcock’s Map, but _Fakatta_ in Kaempfer’s), and there put to death.
  Grace was extended to only (three men), who were sent to China
  with the intelligence of the fate of the army. The destruction of
  so numerous a fleet was considered the most evident proof of the
  protection of the gods.” (_Titsingh_, pp. 264–265.) At p. 259 of
  the same work Klaproth gives another account from the Japanese
  Encyclopædia; the difference is not material.

  The Chinese Annals, in De Mailla, state that the Japanese spared
  10,000 or 12,000 of the Southern Chinese, whom they retained as
  slaves. Gaubil says that 30,000 Mongols were put to death, whilst
  70,000 Coreans and Chinese were made slaves.

  Kúblái was loth to put up with this huge discomfiture, and in
  1283 he made preparations for another expedition; but the project
  excited strong discontent; so strong that some Buddhist monks whom
  he sent before to collect information, were thrown overboard by the
  Chinese sailors; and he gave it up. (_De Mailla_, IX. 409; 418,
  428; _Gaubil_, 195; _Deguignes_, III. 177.)

  [Illustration: Japanese in fight with Chinese. (After Siebold, from
    an ancient Japanese drawing.)

    “=Or ensint avint ceste estoire de la desconfiture de les gens dou
    Grant Kaan.=”]

  The Abacan of Polo is probably the Asikan of the Japanese, whom
  Gaubil calls _Argan_. Vonsainchin is _perhaps_ Fan Wen-hu with the
  Chinese title of _Tsiang-Kiun_ or General (elsewhere represented in
  Polo by _Sangon_),—FAN TSIANG-KIUN.

  We see that, as usual, whilst Marco’s account in some of the main
  features concurs with that of the histories, he gives a good many
  additional particulars, some of which, such as the ill-will
  between the Generals, are no doubt genuine. But of the story of the
  capture of the Japanese capital by the shipwrecked army we know not
  what to make: we can’t accept it certainly.

  Korean and Chinese sources, from which we gather some interesting
  facts regarding the relations of China, Korea, and Japan at the
  time of Kúblái: “In 1265, the seed was sown that led to the
  attempted invasion of Japan by the Mongols. A Koryŭ citizen, Cho
  I., found his way to Peking, and there, having gained the ear of
  the emperor, told him that the Mongol powers ought to secure the
  vassalage of Japan. The emperor listened favourably and determined
  to make advances in that direction. He therefore appointed Heuk
  Chŭk and Eun Hong as envoys to Japan, and ordered them to go
  by way of Koryŭ and take with them to Japan a Koryŭ envoy as
  well. Arriving in Koryŭ they delivered this message to the king,
  and two officials, Son Kun-bi and Kim Ch’an, were appointed to
  accompany them to Japan. They proceeded by the way of Kŏje Harbor
  in Kyŭng-sang Province, but were driven back by a fierce storm,
  and the king sent the Mongol envoys back to Peking. The Emperor
  was ill satisfied with the outcome of the adventure, and sent Heuk
  Chŭk with a letter to the king, ordering him to forward the Mongol
  envoy to Japan. The message which he was to deliver to the ruler of
  Japan said, ‘The Mongol power is kindly disposed towards you and
  desires to open friendly intercourse with you. She does not desire
  your submission, but if you accept her patronage, the great Mongol
  empire will cover the earth.’ The king forwarded the message with
  the envoys to Japan, and informed the emperor of the fact.... The
  Mongol and Koryŭ envoys, upon reaching the Japanese capital, were
  treated with marked disrespect.... They remained five months, ...
  and at last they were dismissed without receiving any answer either
  to the emperor or to the king.” (II. pp. 37, 38.)

  Such was the beginning of the difficulties with Japan; this is
  the end of them: “The following year, 1283, changed the emperor’s
  purpose. He had time to hear the whole story of the sufferings
  of his army in the last invasion; the impossibility of squeezing
  anything more out of Koryŭ, and the delicate condition of home
  affairs, united in causing him to give up the project of conquering
  Japan, and he countermanded the order for the building of boats and
  the storing of grain.” (II. p. 82.)

  Japan was then, for more than a century (A.D. 1205–1333), governed
  really in the name of the descendants of Yoritomo, who proved
  unworthy of their great ancestor “by the so-called ‘Regents’ of the
  Hōjō family, while their liege lords, the Shōguns, though keeping a
  nominal court at Kamakura, were for all that period little better
  than empty names. So completely were the Hōjōs masters of the whole
  country, that they actually had their deputy governors at Kyōtō
  and in Kyūshū in the south-west, and thought nothing of banishing
  Mikados to distant islands. Their rule was made memorable by the
  repulse of the Mongol fleet sent by Kúblái Khan with the purpose of
  adding Japan to his gigantic dominions. This was at the end of the
  13th century, since which time Japan has never been attacked from
  without.” (_B. H. Chamberlain_, _Things Japanese_, 3rd ed., 1898,
  pp. 208–209.)

  The sovereigns (_Mikado_, _Tennō_) of Japan during this period
  were: _Kameyama_-Tennō (1260; abdicated 1274; repulse of the
  Mongols); _Go-Uda_-Tennō (1275; abdicated 1287); _Fushimi_-Tennō
  (1288; abdicated 1298); and _Go-Fushimi_ Tennō. The _shikken_
  (prime ministers) were Hōjō _Tokiyori_ (1246); Hōjō _Tokimune_
  (1261); Hōjō _Sadatoki_ (1284). In 1266 Prince _Kore-yasu_ and in
  1289 _Hisa-akira_, were appointed _shōgun_.—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—_Ram._ says he was sent to a certain island called Zorza
  (_Chorcha?_), where men who have failed in duty are put to death
  in this manner: They wrap the arms of the victim in the hide of a
  newly flayed buffalo, and sew it tight. As this dries it compresses
  him so terribly that he cannot move, and so, finding no help,
  his life ends in misery. The same kind of torture is reported of
  different countries in the East: _e.g._ see _Makrizi_, Pt. III. p.
  108, and Pottinger, as quoted by Marsden _in loco_. It also appears
  among the tortures of a Buddhist hell as represented in a temple at
  Canton. (_Oliphant’s Narrative_, I. 168.)

  NOTE 3.—Like devices to procure invulnerability are common in the
  Indo-Chinese countries. The Burmese sometimes insert pellets of
  gold under the skin with this view. At a meeting of the Asiatic
  Society of Bengal in 1868, gold and silver coins were shown, which
  had been extracted from under the skin of a Burmese convict who had
  been executed at the Andaman Islands. Friar Odoric speaks of the
  practice in one of the Indian Islands (apparently Borneo); and the
  stones possessing such virtue were, according to him, found in the
  bamboo, presumably the siliceous concretions called _Tabashir_.
  Conti also describes the practice in Java of inserting such amulets
  under the skin. The Malays of Sumatra, too, have great faith in
  the efficacy of certain “stones, which they pretend are extracted
  from reptiles, birds, animals, etc., in preventing them from being
  wounded.” (See _Mission to Ava_, p. 208; _Cathay_, 94; _Conti_, p.
  32; _Proc. As. Soc. Beng._ 1868, p. 116; _Anderson’s Mission to
  Sumatra_, p. 323.)

                              CHAPTER IV.

                 CONCERNING THE FASHION OF THE IDOLS.


Now you must know that the Idols of Cathay, and of Manzi, and of this
Island, are all of the same class. And in this Island as well as
elsewhere, there be some of the Idols that have the head of an ox, some
that have the head of a pig, some of a dog, some of a sheep, and some
of divers other kinds. And some of them have four heads, whilst some
have three, one growing out of either shoulder. There are also some
that have four hands, some ten, some a thousand! And they do put more
faith in those Idols that have a thousand hands than in any of the
others.{1} And when any Christian asks them why they make their Idols
in so many different guises, and not all alike, they reply that just so
their forefathers were wont to have them made, and just so they will
leave them to their children, and these to the after generations. And
so they will be handed down for ever. And you must understand that the
deeds ascribed to these Idols are such a parcel of devilries as it
is best not to tell. So let us have done with the Idols, and speak of
other things.

But I must tell you one thing still concerning that Island (and ’tis
the same with the other Indian Islands), that if the natives take
prisoner an enemy who cannot pay a ransom, he who hath the prisoner
summons all his friends and relations, and they put the prisoner to
death, and then they cook him and eat him, and they say there is no
meat in the world so good!—But now we _will_ have done with that Island
and speak of something else.

You must know the Sea in which lie the Islands of those parts is called
the SEA OF CHIN, which is as much as to say “The Sea over against
Manzi.” For, in the language of those Isles, when they say _Chin_, ’tis
Manzi they mean. And I tell you with regard to that Eastern Sea of
Chin, according to what is said by the experienced pilots and mariners
of those parts, there be 7459 Islands in the waters frequented by the
said mariners; and that is how they know the fact, for their whole
life is spent in navigating that sea. And there is not one of those
Islands but produces valuable and odorous woods like the lignaloe,
aye and better too; and they produce also a great variety of spices.
For example in those Islands grows pepper as white as snow, as well
as the black in great quantities. In fact the riches of those Islands
is something wonderful, whether in gold or precious stones, or in all
manner of spicery; but they lie so far off from the main land that it
is hard to get to them. And when the ships of Zayton and Kinsay do
voyage thither they make vast profits by their venture.{2}

It takes them a whole year for the voyage, going in winter and
returning in summer. For in that Sea there are but two winds that blow,
the one that carries them outward and the other that brings them
homeward; and the one of these winds blows all the winter, and the
other all the summer. And you must know these regions are so far from
India that it takes a long time also for the voyage thence.

Though that Sea is called the Sea of Chin, as I have told you, yet
it is part of the Ocean Sea all the same. But just as in these parts
people talk of the Sea of England and the Sea of Rochelle, so in those
countries they speak of the Sea of Chin and the Sea of India, and so
on, though they all are but parts of the Ocean.{3}

Now let us have done with that region which is very inaccessible and
out of the way. Moreover, Messer Marco Polo never was there. And let me
tell you the Great Kaan has nothing to do with them, nor do they render
him any tribute or service.

So let us go back to Zayton and take up the order of our book from that
point.{4}


  NOTE 1.—“Several of the (Chinese) gods have horns on the forehead,
  or wear animals’ heads; some have three eyes.... Some are
  represented in the Indian manner with a multiplicity of arms. We
  saw at Yang-cheu fu a goddess with thirty arms.” (_Deguignes_, I.
  364–366.)

  The reference to any particular form of idolatry here is vague.
  But in Tibetan Buddhism, with which Marco was familiar, all these
  extravagances are prominent, though repugnant to the more orthodox
  Buddhism of the South.

  When the Dalai Lama came to visit the Altun Khan, to secure the
  reconversion of the Mongols in 1577, he appeared as a manifest
  embodiment of the Bodhisatva Avalokiteçvara, with _four hands_, of
  which two were always folded across the breast! The same Bodhisatva
  is sometimes represented with eleven heads. Manjushri manifests
  himself in a golden body with 1000 hands and 1000 _Pátras_ or
  vessels, in each of which were 1000 figures of Sakya visible, etc.
  (_Koeppen_, II. 137; _Vassilyev_, 200.)

  NOTE 2.—Polo seems in this passage to be speaking of the more
  easterly Islands of the Archipelago, such as the Philippines, the
  Moluccas, etc., but with vague ideas of their position.

  NOTE 3.—In this passage alone Polo makes use of the now familiar
  name of CHINA. “_Chin_,” as he says, “in the language of those Isles
  means _Manzi_.” In fact, though the form _Chin_ is more correctly
  Persian, we do get the exact form _China_ from “the language of
  those Isles,” _i.e._ from the _Malay_. _China_ is also used in
  Japanese.

  What he says about the Ocean and the various names of its parts
  is nearly a version of a passage in the geographical Poem of
  Dionysius, ending:—

      Οὕτωϛ Ὠκεανὸς περιδέδρομε λαῖαν ἅπασαν
      Τοῖος ἐὼν καὶ τοῖα μετ’ ἀνδράσιν οὐνόμαθ’ ἔλκων (42–3).

  So also Abulfeda: “This is the sea which flows from the Ocean
  Sea.... This sea takes the names of the countries it washes. Its
  eastern extremity is called the Sea of Chin ... the part west of
  this is called the Sea of India ... then comes the Sea of Fárs, the
  Sea of Berbera, and lastly the Sea of Kolzum” (Red Sea).

  NOTE 4.—The Ramusian here inserts a short chapter, shown by
  the awkward way in which it comes in to be a very manifest
  interpolation, though possibly still an interpolation by the
  Traveller’s hand:—

  “Leaving the port of Zayton you sail westward and something
  south-westward for 1500 miles, passing a gulf called CHEINAN,
  having a length of two months’ sail towards the north. Along
  the whole of its south-east side it borders on the province of
  Manzi, and on the other side with Anin and Coloman, and many
  other provinces formerly spoken of. Within this Gulf there are
  innumerable Islands, almost all well-peopled; and in these is found
  a great quantity of gold-dust, which is collected from the sea
  where the rivers discharge. There is copper also, and other things;
  and the people drive a trade with each other in the things that are
  peculiar to their respective Islands. They have also a traffic with
  the people of the mainland, selling them gold and copper and other
  things; and purchasing in turn what they stand in need of. In the
  greater part of these Islands plenty of corn grows. This gulf is so
  great, and inhabited by so many people, that it seems like a world
  in itself.”

  This passage is translated by Marsden with much forcing, so as to
  describe the China Sea, embracing the Philippine Islands, etc.;
  but, as a matter of fact, it seems clearly to indicate the writer’s
  conception as of a great gulf running up into the continent between
  Southern China and Tong-king for a length equal to two months’
  journey.

  The name of the gulf, Cheinan, _i.e._ _Heinan_, may either be
  that of the Island so called, or, as I rather incline to suppose,
  _’An-nan_, _i.e._ Tong-king. But even by Camoens, writing at Macao
  in 1559–1560, the Gulf of Hainan is styled an unknown sea (though
  this perhaps is only appropriate to the prophetic speaker):—

      “Vês, corre a costa, que Champa se chama,
       Cuja mata he do pao cheiroso ornada:
       Vês, Cauchichina está de escura fama,
       _E de Aināo vê a incognita enseada_” (X. 129).

  And in Sir Robert Dudley’s _Arcano del Mare_ (Firenze, 1647), we
  find a great bottle-necked gulf, of some 5½° in length, running up
  to the north from Tong-king, very much as I have represented the
  Gulf of Cheinan in the attempt to realise Polo’s Own Geography.

                              CHAPTER V.

                  OF THE GREAT COUNTRY CALLED CHAMBA.


You must know that on leaving the port of Zayton you sail
west-south-west for 1500 miles, and then you come to a country called
CHAMBA,{1} a very rich region, having a king of its own. The people are
Idolaters and pay a yearly tribute to the Great Kaan, which consists
of elephants and nothing but elephants. And I will tell you how they
came to pay this tribute.

It happened in the year of Christ 1278 that the Great Kaan sent a Baron
of his called Sagatu with a great force of horse and foot against this
King of Chamba, and this Baron opened the war on a great scale against
the King and his country.

Now the King [whose name was Accambale] was a very aged man, nor had
he such a force as the Baron had. And when he saw what havoc the Baron
was making with his kingdom he was grieved to the heart. So he bade
messengers get ready and despatched them to the Great Kaan. And they
said to the Kaan: “Our Lord the King of Chamba salutes you as his
liege-lord, and would have you to know that he is stricken in years
and long hath held his realm in peace. And now he sends you word by
us that he is willing to be your liegeman, and will send you every
year a tribute of as many elephants as you please. And he prays you in
all gentleness and humility that you would send word to your Baron to
desist from harrying his kingdom and to quit his territories. These
shall henceforth be at your absolute disposal, and the King shall hold
them of you.”

When the Great Kaan had heard the King’s ambassage he was moved with
pity, and sent word to that Baron of his to quit that kingdom with his
army, and to carry his arms to the conquest of some other country; and
as soon as this command reached them they obeyed it. Thus it was then
that this King became vassal of the Great Kaan, and paid him every year
a tribute of 20 of the greatest and finest elephants that were to be
found in the country.

But now we will leave that matter, and tell you other particulars about
the King of Chamba.

You must know that in that kingdom no woman is allowed to marry until
the King shall have seen her; if the woman pleases him then he takes
her to wife; if she does not, he gives her a dowry to get her a husband
withal. In the year of Christ 1285, Messer Marco Polo was in that
country, and at that time the King had, between sons and daughters, 326
children, of whom at least 150 were men fit to carry arms.{2}

There are very great numbers of elephants in this kingdom, and they
have lignaloes in great abundance. They have also extensive forests
of the wood called _Bonús_, which is jet-black, and of which chessmen
and pen-cases are made. But there is nought more to tell, so let us
proceed.{3}


  NOTE 1.—✛The name CHAMPA is of Indian origin, like the adjoining
  Kamboja and many other names in Indo-China, and was probably taken
  from that of an ancient Hindu city and state on the Ganges, near
  modern Bhágalpúr. Hiuen Tsang, in the 7th century, makes mention of
  the Indo-Chinese state as Mahāchampā (_Pèl. Boudd._, III. 83.)

  The title of Champa down to the 15th century seems to have been
  applied by Western Asiatics to a kingdom which embraced the whole
  coast between Tong-king and Kamboja, including all that is now
  called Cochin China outside of Tong-king. It was termed by the
  Chinese _Chen-Ching_. In 1471 the King of Tong-king, Lê Thanh-tong,
  conquered the country, and the genuine people of Champa were
  reduced to a small number occupying the mountains of the province
  of Binh Thuan at the extreme south-east of the Coch. Chinese
  territory. To this part of the coast the name Champa is often
  applied in maps. (See _J. A._ sér. II. tom. xi. p. 31, and _J. des
  Savans_, 1822, p. 71.) The people of Champa in this restricted
  sense are said to exhibit Malay affinities, and they profess
  Mahomedanism. [“The Mussulmans of Binh-Thuan call themselves _Bani_
  or _Orang Bani_, ‘men mussulmans,’ probably from the Arabic _beni_
  ‘the sons,’ to distinguish them from the Chams _Djat_ ‘of race,’
  which they name also _Kaphir_ or _Akaphir_, from the Arabic word
  _kafer_ ‘pagans.’ These names are used in _Binh-Thuan_ to make
  a distinction, but Banis and Kaphirs alike are all Chams.... In
  Cambodia all Chams are Mussulmans.” (_E. Aymonier, Les Tchames_, p.
  26.) The religion of the pagan Chams of Binh-Thuan is degenerate
  Brahmanism with three chief gods, Po-Nagar, Po-Romé, and
  Po-Klong-Garaï. (_Ibid._, p. 35.)—H. C.] The books of their former
  religion they say (according to Dr. Bastian) that they received
  from Ceylon, but they were converted to Islamism by no less a
  person than ’Ali himself. The Tong-king people received their
  Buddhism from China, and this tradition puts Champa as the extreme
  flood-mark of that great tide of Buddhist proselytism, which went
  forth from Ceylon to the Indo-Chinese regions in an early century
  of our era, and which is generally connected with the name of
  Buddaghosha.

  The prominent position of Champa on the route to China made its
  ports places of call for many ages, and in the earliest record of
  the Arab navigation to China we find the country noticed under
  the identical name (allowing for the deficiencies of the Arabic
  Alphabet) of _Ṣanf_ or _Chanf_. Indeed it is highly probable that
  the Ζάβα or Ζάβαι of Ptolemy’s itinerary of the sea-route to the
  _Sinae_ represents this same name.

  [“It is true,” Sir Henry Yule wrote since (1882), “that Champa,
  as known in later days, lay to the east of the Mekong delta,
  whilst Zabai of the Greeks lay to the west of that and of the μέγα
  ακροτήριον—the Great Cape, or C. Cambodia of our maps. Crawford
  (_Desc. Ind. Arch._ p. 80) seems to say that the Malays include
  under the name _Champa_ the whole of what we call Kamboja. This may
  possibly be a slip. But it is certain, as we shall see presently,
  that the Arab _Ṣanf_—which is unquestionably Champa—also lay west
  of the Cape, _i.e._ within the Gulf of Siam. The fact is that the
  Indo-Chinese kingdoms have gone through unceasing and enormous
  vicissitudes, and in early days Champa must have been extensive
  and powerful, for in the travels of Hiuen Tsang (about A.D. 629)
  it is called _Mahâ_-Champa. And my late friend Lieutenant Garnier,
  who gave great attention to these questions, has deduced from such
  data as exist in Chinese Annals and elsewhere, that the ancient
  kingdom which the Chinese describe under the name of _Fu-nan_, as
  extending over the whole peninsula east of the Gulf of Siam, was a
  kingdom of the _Tsiam_ or Champa race. The locality of the ancient
  port of Zabai or Champa is probably to be sought on the west coast
  of Kamboja, near the Campot, or the Kang-kao of our maps. On this
  coast also was the _Ḳomâr_ and _Ḳamârah_ of Ibn Batuta and other
  Arab writers, the great source of aloes-wood, the country then of
  the _Khmer_ or Kambojan People.” (_Notes on the Oldest Records of
  the Sea-Route to China from Western Asia, Proc. R. G. S._ 1882, pp.
  656–657.)

  M. Barth says that this identification would agree well with the
  testimony of his inscription XVIII. B., which comes from Angkor and
  for which _Campā_ is a part of the _Dakshiṇāpatha_, of the southern
  country. But the capital of this rival State of Kamboja would thus
  be very near the Trêang province where inscriptions have been found
  with the names of _Bhavavarman_ and of Īçānavarman. It is true
  that in 627, the King of Kamboja, according to the Chinese Annals
  (_Nouv. Mél. As._ I. p. 84), had subjugated the kingdom of Fu-nan
  identified by Yule and Garnier with _Campā_. Abel Rémusat (_Nouv.
  Mél. As._ I. pp. 75 and 77) identifies it with Tong-king and Stan.
  Julien (_J. As._ 4ᵉ Sér. X. p. 97) with Siam. (_Inscrip. Sanscrites
  du Cambodge_, 1885, pp. 69–70, note.)

  Sir Henry Yule writes (_l.c._ p. 657): “We have said that the Arab
  _Ṣanf_, as well as the Greek _Zabai_, lay west of Cape Cambodia.
  This is proved by the statement that the Arabs on their voyage
  to China made a ten days’ run from _Ṣanf_ to Pulo Condor.” But
  Abulfeda (transl. by _Guyard_, II. ii. p. 127) distinctly says
  that the Komār Peninsula (Khmer) is situated _west_ of the Ṣanf
  Peninsula; between Ṣanf and Komār there is not a day’s journey by
  sea.

  We have, however, another difficulty to overcome.

  I agree with Sir Henry Yule and Marsden that in ch. vii. _infra_,
  p. 276, the text must be read, “When you leave _Chamba_,” instead
  of “When you leave _Java_.” Coming from Zayton and sailing 1500
  miles, Polo arrives at Chamba; from Chamba, sailing 700 miles he
  arrives at the islands of Sondur and Condur, identified by Yule
  with Sundar Fúlát (Pulo Condore); from Sundar Fúlát, after 500
  miles more, he finds the country called Locac; then he goes to
  Pentam (Bintang, 500 miles), Malaiur, and Java the Less (Sumatra).
  Ibn Khordâdhbeh’s itinerary agrees pretty well with Marco Polo’s,
  as Professor De Goeje remarks to me: “Starting from Mâit (Bintang),
  and leaving on the left Tiyuma (Timoan), in five days’ journey,
  one goes to Kimèr (Kmer, Cambodia), and after three days more,
  following the coast, arrives to Ṣanf; then to Lukyn, the first
  point of call in China, 100 parasangs by land or by sea; from
  Lukyn it takes four days by sea and twenty by land to go to
  Kanfu.” [Canton, see note, _supra_ p. 199.] (See _De Goeje’s Ibn
  Khordâdhbeh_, p. 48 _et seq._) But we come now to the difficulty.
  Professor De Goeje writes to me: “It is strange that in the
  _Relation des Voyages_ of Reinaud, p. 20 of the text, reproduced by
  Ibn al Fakîh, p. 12 _seq._, Sundar Fúlát (Pulo Condore) is placed
  between Ṣanf and the China Sea (_Sandjy_); it takes ten days to go
  from Ṣanf to Sundar Fúlát, and then a month (seven days of which
  between mountains called the Gates of China). In the _Livre des
  Merveilles de l’Inde_ (pp. 85, 86) we read: ‘When arrived between
  Ṣanf and the China coast, in the neighbourhood of Sundar Fúlát, an
  island situated at the entrance of the Sea of Sandjy, which is the
  Sea of China....’ It would appear from these two passages that Ṣanf
  is to be looked for in the Malay Peninsula. This Ṣanf is different
  from the Ṣanf of Ibn Khordâdhbeh and of Abulfeda.” (_Guyard’s
  transl._ II. ii. 127.)

  It does not strike me from these passages that Ṣanf must be looked
  for in the Malay Peninsula. Indeed Professor G. Schlegel, in a
  paper published in the _T’oung Pao_, vol. x., seems to prove that
  Shay-po (Djava), represented by Chinese characters, which are the
  transcription of the Sanskrit name of the China Rose (_Hibiscus
  rosa sinensis_), Djavâ or Djapâ, is not the great island of Java,
  but, according to Chinese texts, a state of the Malay Peninsula;
  but he does not seem to me to prove that Shay-po is Champa, as he
  believes he has done.

  However, Professor De Goeje adds in his letter, and I quite agree
  with the celebrated Arabic scholar of Leyden, that he does not
  very much like the theory of two Ṣanf, and that he is inclined
  to believe that the sea captain of the _Marvels of India_ placed
  Sundar Fúlát a little too much to the north, and that the narrative
  of the _Relation des Voyages_ is inexact.

  To conclude: the history of the relations between Annam (Tong-king)
  and her southern neighbour, the kingdom of Champa, the itineraries
  of Marco Polo and Ibn Khordâdhbeh as well as the position given
  to Ṣanf by Abulfeda, justify me, I think, in placing Champa in
  that part of the central and southern Indo-Chinese coast which the
  French to-day call Annam (Cochinchine and Basse-Cochinchine), the
  Binh-Thuan province showing more particularly what remains of the
  ancient kingdom.

  Since I wrote the above, I have received No. 1 of vol. ii. of the
  _Bul. de l’Ecole Française d’Extrême-Orient_, which contains a
  note on _Canf et Campā_, by M. A. Barth. The reasons given in a
  note addressed to him by Professor De Goeje and the work of Ibn
  Khordâdhbeh have led M. A. Barth to my own conclusion, viz. that
  the coast of Champa was situated where inscriptions have been found
  on the Annamite coast.—H. C.]

  The Sagatu of Marco appears in the Chinese history as _Sotu_, the
  military governor of the Canton districts, which he had been active
  in reducing.

  In 1278 Sotu sent an envoy to Chen-ching to claim the king’s
  submission, which was rendered, and for some years he sent his
  tribute to Kúblái. But when the Kaan proceeded to interfere in
  the internal affairs of the kingdom by sending a Resident and
  Chinese officials, the king’s son (1282) resolutely opposed these
  proceedings, and threw the Chinese officials into prison. The Kaan,
  in great wrath at this insult (coming also so soon after his
  discomfiture in Japan), ordered Sotu and others to Chen-ching to
  take vengeance. The prince in the following year made a pretence
  of submission, and the army (if indeed it had been sent) seems to
  have been withdrawn. The prince, however, renewed his attack on the
  Chinese establishments, and put 100 of their officials to death.
  Sotu then despatched a new force, but it was quite unsuccessful,
  and had to retire. In 1284 the king sent an embassy, including
  his grandson, to beg for pardon and reconciliation. Kúblái,
  however, refused to receive them, and ordered his son Tughan to
  advance through Tong-king, an enterprise which led to a still more
  disastrous war with that country, in which the Mongols had much the
  worst of it. We are not told more.

  Here we have the difficulties usual with Polo’s historical
  anecdotes. Certain names and circumstances are distinctly
  recognisable in the Chinese Annals; others are difficult to
  reconcile with these. The embassy of 1284 seems the most likely to
  be the one spoken of by Polo, though the Chinese history does not
  give it the favourable result which he ascribes to it. The date in
  the text we see to be wrong, and as usual it varies in different
  MSS. I suspect the original date was MCCLXXXIII.

  One of the Chinese notices gives one of the king’s names as
  _Sinhopala_, and no doubt this is Ramusio’s _Accambale_ (Açambale);
  an indication at once of the authentic character of that
  interpolation, and of the identity of Champa and Chen-ching.

  [We learn from an inscription that in 1265 the King of Champa was
  Jaya-Sinhavarman II., who was named Indravarman in 1277, and whom
  the Chinese called _Che li Tseya Sinho phala Maha thiwa_ (Çri Jaya
  Sinha varmma maha deva). He was the king at the time of Polo’s
  voyage. (_A. Bergaigne, Ancien royaume de Campā_, pp. 39–40; _E.
  Aymonier, les Tchames et leurs religions_, p. 14.)—H. C.]

  There are notices of the events in De Mailla (IX. 420–422) and
  Gaubil (194), but Pauthier’s extracts which we have made use of are
  much fuller.

  Elephants have generally formed a chief part of the presents or
  tribute sent periodically by the various Indo-Chinese states to the
  Court of China.

  [In a Chinese work published in the 14th century, by an Annamite,
  under the title of _Ngan-nan chi lio_, and translated into French
  by M. Sainson (1896), we read (p. 397): “Elephants are found only
  in Lin-y; this is the country which became Champa. It is the habit
  to have burdens carried by elephants; this country is to-day the
  Pu-chêng province.” M. Sainson adds in a note that Pu-chêng, in
  Annamite Bó chańh quân, is to-day Quang-binh, and that, in this
  country, was placed the first capital (Dong-hoi) of the future
  kingdom of Champa thrown later down to the south.—H. C.]

  [The Chams, according to their tradition, had three capitals:
  the most ancient, _Shri-Banœuy_, probably the actual Quang-Binh
  province; _Bal-Hangov_, near Hué; and _Bal-Angoué_, in the
  Binh-Dinh province. In the 4th century, the kingdom of _Lin-y_ or
  _Lâm-âp_ is mentioned in the Chinese Annals.—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—The date of Marco’s visit to Champa varies in the MSS.:
  Pauthier has 1280, as has also Ramusio; the G. T. has 1285; the
  Geographic Latin 1288. I incline to adopt the last. For we know
  that about 1290, Mark returned to Court from a mission to the
  Indian Seas, which might have included this visit to Champa.

  The large family of the king was one of the stock marvels. Odoric
  says: “ZAMPA is a very fine country, having great store of victuals
  and all good things. The king of the country, it was said when I
  was there [_circa_ 1323], had, what with sons and with daughters, a
  good two hundred children; for he hath many wives and other women
  whom he keepeth. This king hath also 14,000 tame elephants.... And
  other folk keep elephants there just as commonly as we keep oxen
  here” (pp. 95–96). The latter point illustrates what Polo says of
  elephants, and is scarcely an exaggeration in regard to all the
  southern Indo-Chinese States. (See note to Odoric u.s.)

  NOTE 3.—Champa Proper and the adjoining territories have been from
  time immemorial the chief seat of the production of lign-aloes or
  eagle-wood. Both names are misleading, for the thing has nought
  to do either with aloes or eagles; though good Bishop Pallegoix
  derives the latter name from the wood being speckled like an
  eagle’s plumage. It is in fact through _Aquila_, _Agila_, from
  _Aguru_, one of the Sanskrit names of the article, whilst that is
  possibly from the Malay _Kayu_ (wood)-_gahru_, though the course
  of the etymology is more likely to be the other way; and Αλόη is
  perhaps a corruption of the term which the Arabs apply to it, viz.
  _Al-’Ud_, “The Wood.”

  [It is probable that the first Portuguese who had to do with
  eagle-wood called it by its Arabic name, _aghāluḥy_, or malayālam,
  _agila_; whence _páo de’ aguila_ “aguila wood.” It was translated
  into Latin as _lignum aquilae_, and after into modern languages,
  as _bois d’aigle_, _eagle-wood_, _adlerholz_, etc. (_A. Cabaton,
  les Chams_, p. 50.) Mr. Groeneveldt (_Notes_, pp. 141–142) writes:
  “_Lignum aloes_ is the wood of the _Aquilaria agallocha_, and
  is chiefly known as _sinking incense_. The _Pen-ts’au Kang-mu_
  describes it as follows: ‘_Sinking incense_, also called _honey
  incense_. It comes from the heart and the knots of a tree and sinks
  in water, from which peculiarity the name _sinking incense_ is
  derived.... In the Description of Annam we find it called _honey
  incense_, because it smells like honey.’ The same work, as well
  as the _Nan-fang Ts’au-mu Chuang_, further informs us that this
  incense was obtained in all countries south of China, by felling
  the old trees and leaving them to decay, when, after some time,
  only the heart, the knots, and some other hard parts remained. The
  product was known under different names, according to its quality
  or shape, and in addition to the names given above, we find _fowl
  bones_, _horse-hoofs_, and _green cinnamon_; these latter names,
  however, are seldom used.”—H. C.]

  The fine eagle-wood of Champa is the result of disease in a
  leguminous tree, _Aloexylon Agallochum_; whilst an inferior kind,
  though of the same aromatic properties, is derived from a tree of
  an entirely different order, _Aquilaria Agallocha_, and is found as
  far north as Silhet.

  The _Bonus_ of the G. T. here is another example of Marco’s use,
  probably unconscious, of an Oriental word. It is Persian _Abnús_,
  Ebony, which has passed almost unaltered into the Spanish _Abenuz_.
  We find _Ibenus_ also in a French inventory (_Douet d’Arcq_, p.
  134), but the _Bonús_ seems to indicate that the word as used by
  the Traveller was strange to Rusticiano. The word which he uses
  for pen-cases too, _Calamanz_, is more suggestive of the Persian
  _Ḳalamdán_ than of the Italian _Calamajo_.

  “Ebony is very common in this country (Champa), but the wood
  which is the most precious, and which is sufficiently abundant,
  is called ‘Eagle-wood,’ of which the first quality sells for its
  weight in gold; the native name is _Kínam_.” (_Bishop Louis_ in J.
  A. S. B. VI. 742; _Dr. Birdwood_, in the _Bible Educator_, I. 243;

                              CHAPTER VI.

                 CONCERNING THE GREAT ISLAND OF JAVA.


When you sail from Chamba, 1500 miles in a course between south and
south-east, you come to a great Island called Java. And the experienced
mariners of those Islands who know the matter well, say that it is
the greatest Island in the world, and has a compass of more than 3000
miles. It is subject to a great King and tributary to no one else
in the world. The people are Idolaters. The Island is of surpassing
wealth, producing black pepper, nutmegs, spikenard, galingale, cubebs,
cloves, and all other kinds of spices.

This Island is also frequented by a vast amount of shipping, and by
merchants who buy and sell costly goods from which they reap great
profit. Indeed the treasure of this Island is so great as to be past
telling. And I can assure you the Great Kaan never could get possession
of this Island, on account of its great distance, and the great
expense of an expedition thither. The merchants of Zayton and Manzi
draw annually great returns from this country.{1}

  NOTE 1.—Here Marco speaks of that Pearl of Islands, Java. The
  chapter is a digression from the course of his voyage towards
  India, but possibly he may have touched at the island on his
  previous expedition, alluded to in note 2, ch. v. Not more, for the
  account is vague, and where particulars are given not accurate.
  Java does not _produce_ nutmegs or cloves, though doubtless it was
  a great mart for these and all the products of the Archipelago. And
  if by _treasure_ he means gold, as indeed Ramusio reads, no gold is
  found in Java. Barbosa, however, has the same story of the great
  amount of gold drawn from Java; and De Barros says that Sunda,
  _i.e._ Western Java, which the Portuguese regarded as a distinct
  island, produced inferior gold of 7 carats, but that pepper was
  the staple, of which the annual supply was more than 30,000 cwt.

    “=En ceste Ysle vienent grant quantité de nés, e de mercanz qe hi
    acatent de maintes mercandies et hi font grant gaagne.=”]

  The circuit ascribed to Java in Pauthier’s Text is 5000 miles. Even
  the 3000 which we take from the Geog. Text is about double the
  truth; but it is exactly the same that Odoric and Conti assign.
  No doubt it was a tradition among the Arab seamen. They never
  visited the south coast, and probably had extravagant ideas of
  its extension in that direction, as the Portuguese had for long.
  Even at the end of the 16th century Linschoten says: “Its breadth
  is as yet unknown; some conceiving it to be a part of the Terra
  Australis extending from opposite the Cape of Good Hope. _However
  it is commonly held to be an island_” (ch. xx.). And in the old map
  republished in the Lisbon De Barros of 1777, the south side of Java
  is marked “Parte incognita de Java,” and is without a single name,
  whilst a narrow strait runs right across the island (the supposed
  division of Sunda from Java Proper).

  The history of Java previous to the rise of the Empire of
  Majapahit, in the age immediately following our Traveller’s voyage,
  is very obscure. But there is some evidence of the existence
  of a powerful dynasty in the island about this time; and in an
  inscription of ascertained date (A.D. 1294) the King Uttungadeva
  claims to have subjected _five kings_, and to be sovereign of the
  whole Island of Java (_Jawa-dvipa_; see Lassen, IV. 482). It is
  true that, as our Traveller says, Kúblái had not yet attempted the
  subjugation of Java, but he did make the attempt almost immediately
  after the departure of the Venetians. It was the result of one
  of his unlucky embassies to claim the homage of distant states,
  and turned out as badly as the attempts against Champa and Japan.
  His ambassador, a Chinese called Meng-K’i, was sent back with
  his face branded like a thief’s. A great armament was assembled
  in the ports of Fo-kien to avenge this insult; it started about
  January, 1293, but did not effect a landing till autumn. After some
  temporary success the force was constrained to re-embark with a
  loss of 3000 men. The death of Kúblái prevented any renewal of the
  attempt; and it is mentioned that his successor gave orders for the
  re-opening of the Indian trade which the Java war had interrupted.
  (See _Gaubil_, pp. 217 _seqq._, 224.) To this failure Odoric, who
  visited Java about 1323, alludes: “Now the Great Kaan of Cathay
  many a time engaged in war with this king; but the king always
  vanquished and got the better of him.” Odoric speaks in high terms
  of the richness and population of Java, calling it “the second
  best of all Islands that exist,” and describing a gorgeous palace
  in terms similar to those in which Polo speaks of the Palace of
  Chipangu. (_Cathay_, p. 87 _seqq._)

  [We read in the _Yuen-shi_ (Bk. 210), translated by Mr.
  Groeneveldt, that “Java is situated beyond the sea and further away
  than Champa; when one embarks at Ts’wan-chau and goes southward, he
  first comes to Champa and afterwards to this country.” It appears
  that when his envoy Mêng-K’i had been branded on the face, Kúblái,
  in 1292, appointed Shih-pi, a native of Po-yeh, district Li-chau,
  Pao-ting fu, Chih-li province, commander of the expedition to Java,
  whilst Ike-Mese, a Uighúr, and Kau-Hsing, a man from Ts’ai-chau
  (Ho-nan), were appointed to assist him. Mr. Groeneveldt has
  translated the accounts of these three officers. In the _Ming-shi_
  (Bk. 324) we read: “Java is situated at the south-west of Champa.
  In the time of the Emperor Kúblái of the Yuen Dynasty, Mêng-K’i was
  sent there as an envoy and had his face cut, on which Kúblái sent a
  large army which subdued the country and then came back.” (_L.c._
  p. 34.) The prince guilty of this insult was the King of Tumapel
  “in the eastern part of the island Java, whose country was called
  Java par excellence by the Chinese, because it was in this part of
  the island they chiefly traded.” (_L.c._ p. 32.)—H. C.]

  The curious figure of a vessel which we give here is taken from
  the vast series of mediæval sculptures which adorns the great
  Buddhist pyramid in the centre of Java, known as Boro Bodor, one of
  the most remarkable architectural monuments in the world, but the
  history of which is all in darkness. The ship, with its outrigger
  and apparently canvas sails, is not Chinese, but it undoubtedly
  pictures vessels which frequented the ports of Java in the early
  part of the 14th century,[1] possibly one of those from Ceylon or
  Southern India.

                             CHAPTER VII.

       WHEREIN THE ISLES OF SONDUR AND CONDUR ARE SPOKEN OF; AND
                         THE KINGDOM OF LOCAC.


When you leave Chamba{1} and sail for 700 miles on a course between
south and south-west, you arrive at two Islands, a greater and a less.
The one is called SONDUR and the other CONDUR.{2} As there is nothing
about them worth mentioning, let us go on five hundred miles beyond
Sondur, and then we find another country which is called LOCAC. It is
a good country and a rich; [it is on the mainland]; and it has a king
of its own. The people are Idolaters and have a peculiar language, and
pay tribute to nobody, for their country is so situated that no one can
enter it to do them ill. Indeed if it were possible to get at it, the
Great Kaan would soon bring them under subjection to him.

In this country the brazil which we make use of grows in great plenty;
and they also have gold in incredible quantity. They have elephants
likewise, and much game. In this kingdom too are gathered all the
porcelain shells which are used for small change in all those regions,
as I have told you before.

There is nothing else to mention except that this is a very wild
region, visited by few people; nor does the king desire that any
strangers should frequent the country, and so find out about his
treasure and other resources.{3} We will now proceed, and tell you of
something else.


  NOTE 1.—All the MSS. and texts I believe without exception read
  “_when you leave_ Java,” etc. But, as Marsden has indicated, the
  point of departure is really _Champa_, the introduction of Java
  being a digression; and the retention of the latter name here
  would throw us irretrievably into the Southern Ocean. Certain old
  geographers, we may observe, did follow that indication, and the
  results were curious enough, as we shall notice in next note but
  one. Marsden’s observations are so just that I have followed
  Pauthier in substituting Champa for Java in the text.

  NOTE 2.—There is no reason to doubt that these islands are the
  group now known as that of PULO CONDORE, in old times an important
  landmark, and occasional point of call, on the route to China. The
  group is termed _Sundar Fúlát_ (_Fúlát_ representing the Malay
  _Pulo_ or Island, in the plural) in the Arab _Relations_ of the 9th
  century, the last point of departure on the voyage to China, from
  which it was a month distant. This old record gives us the name
  _Sondor_; in modern times we have it as _Kondór_; Polo combines
  both names. [“These may also be the ‘Satyrs’ Islands’ of Ptolemy,
  or they may be his _Sindai_; for he has a _Sinda_ city on the
  coast close to this position, though his Sindai islands are dropt
  far away. But it would not be difficult to show that Ptolemy’s
  islands have been located almost at random, or as from a pepper
  castor.” (_Yule_, _Oldest Records_, p. 657.)] The group consists of
  a larger island about 12 miles long, two of 2 or 3 miles, and some
  half-dozen others of insignificant dimensions. The large one is now
  specially called Pulo Condore. It has a fair harbour, fresh water,
  and wood in abundance. Dampier visited the group and recommended
  its occupation. The E. I. Company did establish a post there in
  1702, but it came to a speedy end in the massacre of the Europeans
  by their Macassar garrison. About the year 1720 some attempt to
  found a settlement there was also made by the French, who gave the
  island the name of _Isle d’Orléans_. The celebrated Père Gaubil
  spent eight months on the island and wrote an interesting letter
  about it (February, 1722; see also _Lettres Edifiantes_, Rec.
  xvi.). When the group was visited by Mr. John Crawford on his
  mission to Cochin China the inhabitants numbered about 800, of
  Cochin Chinese descent. The group is now held by the French under
  Saigon. The chief island is known to the Chinese as the mountain of
  Kunlun. There is another cluster of rocks in the same sea, called
  the Seven Cheu, and respecting these two groups Chinese sailors
  have a kind of _Incidit-in-Scyllan_ saw:—

      “_Shang p’a Tsi-chéu, hia-pa Kun-lun,
       Chen mi t’uo shih, jin chuen mo tsun._”[1]

  Meaning:—

      “With Kunlun to starboard, and larboard the Cheu,
       Keep conning your compass, whatever you do,
       Or to Davy Jones’ Locker go vessel and crew.”

  (_Ritter_, IV. 1017; _Reinaud_, I. 18; _A. Hamilton_, II. 402;
  _Mém. conc. les Chinois_, XIV. 53.)

  NOTE 3.—Pauthier reads the name of the kingdom _Soucat_, but I
  adhere to the readings of the G. T., _Lochac_ and _Locac_, which
  are supported by Ramusio. Pauthier’s C and the Bern MS. have _le
  chac_ and _le that_, which indicate the same reading.

  Distance and other particulars point, as Hugh Murray discerns, to
  the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, or (as I conceive) to the
  territory now called Siam, including the said coast, as subject or
  tributary from time immemorial.

  The kingdom of Siam is known to the Chinese by the name of
  _Sien-Lo_. The Supplement to Ma Twan-lin’s Encyclopædia describes
  Sien-Lo as on the sea-board to the extreme south of Chen-ching. “It
  originally consisted of two kingdoms, _Sien_ and _Lo-hoh_. The Sien
  people are the remains of a tribe which in the year (A.D. 1341)
  began to come down upon the Lo-hoh, and united with the latter into
  one nation.... The land of the Lo-hoh consists of extended plains,
  but not much agriculture is done.”[2]

  In this _Lo_ or LO-HOH, which apparently formed the lower part
  of what is now Siam, previous to the middle of the 14th century,
  I believe that we have our Traveller’s Locac. The latter half of
  the name may be either the second syllable of Lo-Hoh, for Polo’s
  _c_ often represents _h_; or it may be the Chinese _Kwŏ_ or _Kwé_,
  “kingdom,” in the Canton and Fo-kien pronunciation (_i.e._ the
  pronunciation of Polo’s mariners) _kok_; _Lo-kok_, “the kingdom of
  Lo.” _Sien_-LO-KOK is the exact form of the Chinese name of Siam
  which is used by Bastian.

  What was this kingdom of Lo which occupied the northern shores of
  the Gulf of Siam? Chinese scholars generally say that _Sien-Lo_
  means Siam and _Laos_; but this I cannot accept, if Laos is to bear
  its ordinary geographical sense, _i.e._ of a country bordering Siam
  on the _north-east and north_. Still there seems a probability that
  the usual interpretation may be correct, when properly explained.

  [Regarding the identification of Locac with Siam, Mr. G. Phillips
  writes (_Jour. China B. R. A. S._, XXI., 1886, p. 34, note): “I can
  only fully endorse what Col. Yule says upon this subject, and add
  a few extracts of my own taken from the article on Siam given
  in the _Wu-pé-ché_. It would appear that previously to 1341 a
  country called Lohoh (in Amoy pronunciation Lohok) existed, as
  Yule says, in what is now called Lower Siam, and at that date
  became incorporated with Sien. In the 4th year of Hung-wu, 1372, it
  sent tribute to China, under the name of Sien Lohok. The country
  was first called Sien Lo in the first year of Yung Lo, 1403. In
  the T’ang Dynasty it appears to have been known as _Lo-yueh_,
  pronounced _Lo-gueh_ at that period. This _Lo-yueh_ would seem to
  have been situated on the Eastern side of Malay Peninsula, and to
  have extended to the entrance to the Straits of Singapore, in what
  is now known as Johore.”—H. C.]

  In 1864, Dr. Bastian communicated to the Asiatic Society of Bengal
  the translation of a long and interesting inscription, brought [in
  1834] from Sukkothai to Bangkok by the late King of Siam [Mongkut,
  then crown prince], and dated in _a_ year 1214, which in the era of
  Salivahana (as it is almost certainly, see _Garnier_, cited below)
  will be A.D. 1292–1293, almost exactly coincident with Polo’s
  voyage. The author of this inscription was a Prince of _Thai_ (or
  Siamese) race, styled Phra Râma Kamhêng (“The Valiant”) [son of Srī
  Indratiya], who reigned in Sukkothai, whilst his dominions extended
  from Vieng-chan on the Mekong River (lat. 18°), to Pechabur, and
  Srī-Thammarat (_i.e._ Ligór, in lat. 8° 18′), on the coast of the
  Gulf of Siam. [This inscription gives three dates—1205, 1209, and
  1214 śaka = A.D. 1283, 1287 and 1292. One passage says: “Formerly
  the Thaïs had no writing; it is in 1205 śaka, year of the goat =
  A.D. 1283, that King Râma Kamhêng sent for a teacher who invented
  the Thaï writing. It is to him that we are indebted for it to-day.”
  (Cf. _Fournereau, Siam ancien_, p. 225; _Schmitt, Exc. et Recon._,
  1885; _Aymonier, Cambodge_, II. p. 72.)—H. C.] The conquests of
  this prince are stated to have extended eastward to the “Royal
  Lake,” apparently the Great Lake of Kamboja; and we may conclude
  with certainty that he was the leader of the Siamese, who had
  invaded Kamboja shortly before it was visited (in 1296) by that
  envoy of Kúblái’s successor, whose valuable account of the country
  has been translated by Rémusat.[3] Now this prince Râma Kamhêng
  of Sukkothai was probably (as Lieutenant Garnier supposes) of the
  _Thai-nyai_, Great Thai, or Laotian branch of the race. Hence the
  application of the name Lo-kok to his kingdom can be accounted for.

  It was another branch of the Thai, known as _Thai-noi_, or Little
  Thai, which in 1351, under another Phra Rama, founded Ayuthia and
  the Siamese monarchy, which still exists.

  The explanation now given seems more satisfactory than the
  suggestions formerly made of the connection of the name _Locac_,
  either with Lophāburi (or _Lavó, Louvo_), a very ancient capital
  near Ayuthia, or with _Lawék_, _i.e._ Kamboja. Kamboja had at an
  earlier date possessed the lower valley of the Menam, but, we see,
  did so no longer.[4]

  The name _Lawek_ or Lovek is applied by writers of the 16th and
  17th centuries to the capital of what is still Kamboja, the ruins
  of which exist near Udong. _Laweik_ is mentioned along with
  the other Siamese or Laotian countries of Yuthia, Tennasserim,
  Sukkothai, Pichalok, Lagong, Lanchang (or Luang Prabang), Zimmé
  (or Kiang-mai), and Kiang-Tung, in the vast list of states claimed
  by the Burmese Chronicle as tributary to Pagán before its fall. We
  find in the _Aín-i-Akbari_ a kind of aloes-wood called _Lawáki_, no
  doubt because it came from this region.

  The G. T. indeed makes the course from Sondur to Locac _sceloc_ or
  S.E.; but Pauthier’s text seems purposely to correct this, calling
  it, “_v. c. milles_ oultre _Sandur_.” This would bring us to the
  Peninsula somewhere about what is now the Siamese province of
  Ligor,[5] and this is the only position accurately consistent with
  the next indication of the route, viz. a run of 500 miles _south_
  to the Straits of Singapore. Let us keep in mind also Ramusio’s
  specific statement that Locac was on _terra firma_.

  As regards the products named: (1) gold is mined in the northern
  part of the Peninsula and is a staple export of Kalantan, Tringano,
  and Pahang, further down. Barbosa says gold was so abundant in
  Malacca that it was reckoned by _Bahars_ of 4 cwt. Though Mr. Logan
  has estimated the present produce of the whole Peninsula at only
  20,000 ounces, Hamilton, at the beginning of last century, says
  Pahang alone in some years exported above 8 cwt. (2) Brazil-wood,
  now generally known by the Malay term _Sappan_, is abundant on
  the coast. Ritter speaks of three small towns on it as entirely
  surrounded by trees of this kind. And higher up, in the latitude
  of Tavoy, the forests of sappan-wood find a prominent place in
  some maps of Siam. In mediæval intercourse between the courts of
  Siam and China we find Brazil-wood to form the bulk of the Siamese
  present. [“Ma Huan fully bears out Polo’s statement in this matter,
  for he says: This Brazil (of which Marco speaks) is as plentiful
  as firewood. On Chêng-ho’s chart Brazil and other fragrant woods
  are marked as products of Siam. Polo’s statement of the use of
  porcelain shells as small change is also corroborated by Ma Huan.”
  (_G. Phillips, Jour. China B. R. A. S._, XXI., 1886, p. 37.)—H. C.]
  (3) Elephants are abundant. (4) Cowries, according to Marsden
  and Crawford, are found in those seas largely only on the Sulu
  Islands; but Bishop Pallegoix says distinctly that they are found
  _in abundance_ on the sand-banks of the Gulf of Siam. And I see Dr.
  Fryer, in 1673, says that cowries were brought to Surat “from Siam
  and the Philippine Islands.”

  For some centuries after this time Siam was generally known to
  traders by the Persian name of _Shahr-i-nao_, or New City. This
  seems to be the name generally applied to it in the _Shijarat
  Malayu_ (or Malay Chronicle), and it is used also by Abdurrazzák.
  It appears among the early navigators of the 16th century, as Da
  Gama, Varthema, Giovanni d’Empoli and Mendez Pinto, in the shape
  of _Sornau, Xarnau_. Whether this name was applied to the new city
  of Ayuthia, or was a translation of that of the older _Lophāburi_
  (which appears to be the Sansk. or Pali _Nava pura_ = New-City) I
  do not know.

  [Reinaud (_Int. Abulfeda_, p. CDXVI.) writes that, according to
  the Christian monk of Nadjran, who crossed the Malayan Seas, about
  the year 980, at this time, the King of Lukyn had just invaded
  the kingdom of Ṣanf and taken possession of it. According to Ibn
  Khordâdhbeh (_De Goeje_, p. 49) Lukyn is the first port of China,
  100 parasangs distant from Ṣanf by land or sea; Chinese stone,
  Chinese silk, porcelain of excellent quality, and rice are to be
  found at Lukyn.—H. C.]

  Some geographers of the 16th century, following the old editions
  which carried the travellers south-east or south-west of Java
  to the land of _Boeach_ (for Locac), introduced in their maps a
  continent in that situation. (See _e.g._ the map of the world by
  P. Plancius in Linschoten.) And this has sometimes been adduced to
  prove an early knowledge of Australia. Mr. Major has treated this
  question ably in his interesting essay on the early notices of
  Australia.

    _I. B._ IV. 240; _Cathay_, 469, 519.) Ḳakula and Ḳamarah were both
    in “_Mul-Java_”; and the king of this undetermined country, whom
    Wassáf states to have submitted to Kúblái in 1291, was called _Sri

    different name from Lakhon. The latter is a corruption of the
    Sanskrit, _Nagara_, “city.”




                             CHAPTER VIII.

           OF THE ISLAND CALLED PENTAM, AND THE CITY MALAIUR.


When you leave Locac and sail for 500 miles towards the south, you come
to an island called PENTAM, a very wild place. All the wood that grows
thereon consists of odoriferous trees.{1} There is no more to say about
it; so let us sail about sixty miles further between those two Islands.
Throughout this distance there is but four paces’ depth of water, so
that great ships in passing this channel have to lift their rudders,
for they draw nearly as much water as that.{2}

And when you have gone these 60 miles, and again about 30 more, you
come to an Island which forms a Kingdom, and is called MALAIUR. The
people have a King of their own, and a peculiar language. The city is
a fine and noble one, and there is great trade carried on there. All
kinds of spicery are to be found there, and all other necessaries of
life.{3}


  NOTE 1.—_Pentam_, or as in Ram. _Pentan_, is no doubt the Bintang
  of our maps, more properly BENTĂN, a considerable Island at the
  eastern extremity of the Straits of Malacca. It appears in the
  list, published by Dulaurier from a Javanese Inscription, of the
  kingdoms conquered in the 15th century by the sovereigns reigning
  at Majapahit in Java. (_J. A._ sér. IV. tom. xiii. 532.) Bintang
  was for a long time after the Portuguese conquest of Malacca the
  chief residence of the Malay Sultans who had been expelled by that
  conquest, and it still nominally belongs to the Sultan of Johore,
  the descendant of those princes, though in fact ruled by the Dutch,
  whose port of Rhio stands on a small island close to its western
  shore. It is the _Bintão_ of the Portuguese whereof Camoens speaks
  as the persistent enemy of Malacca (X. 57).

  [Cf. _Professor Schlegel’s Geog. Notes_, VI. _Ma-it_; regarding the
  odoriferous trees, Professor Schlegel remarks (p. 20) that they
  were probably santal trees.—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—There is a good deal of confusion in the text of this
  chapter. Here we have a passage spoken of between “those two
  Islands,” when only one island seems to have been mentioned.
  But I imagine the other “island” in the traveller’s mind to be
  the continuation of the same Locac, _i.e._ the Malay Peninsula
  (included by him under that name), which he has coasted for 500
  miles. This is confirmed by Ramusio, and the old Latin editions
  (as Müller’s): “between the kingdom of Locac and the Island of
  Pentan.” The passage in question is the Strait of Singapore, or as
  the old navigators called it, the Straits of Gobernador, having
  the mainland of the Peninsula and the Island of Singapore, on the
  one side, and the Islands of Bintang and Batang on the other. The
  length of the strait is roughly 60 geographical miles, or a little
  more; and I see in a route given in the _Lettres Edifiantes_ (II.
  p. 118) that the length of navigation is so stated: “Le détroit de
  Gobernador a vingt lieues de long, et est fort difficile quand on
  n’y a jamais passé.”

  The Venetian _passo_ was 5 feet. Marco here alludes to the
  well-known practice with the Chinese junks of raising the rudder,
  for which they have a special arrangement, which is indicated in
  the cut at p. 248.

  NOTE 3.—There is a difficulty here about the indications, carrying
  us, as they do, first 60 miles through the Strait, and then 30
  miles further to the Island Kingdom and city of Malaiur. There
  is also a singular variation in the readings as to this city and
  island. The G. T. has “_Une isle qe est roiame, et s’apelle_
  Malanir e l’isle Pentam.” The Crusca has the same, only reading
  _Malavir_. Pauthier: “_Une isle qui est royaume, et a nom_ Maliur.”
  The Geog. Latin: “_Ibi invenitur una insula in qua est unus rex_
  quem vocant Lamovich. _Civitas et insula vocantur_ Pontavich.”
  Ram.: “_Chiamasi la città_ Malaiur, e cosi l’isola Malaiur.”

  All this is very perplexed, and it is difficult to trace what may
  have been the true readings. The 30 miles beyond the straits,
  whether we give the direction _south-east_ as in G. T. or no, will
  not carry us to the vicinity of any place known to have been the
  site of an important city. As the point of departure in the next
  chapter is from _Pentam_ and not from Malaiur, the introduction of
  the latter is perhaps a digression from the route, on information
  derived either from hearsay or from a former voyage. But there is
  not information enough to decide what place is meant by Malaiur.
  Probabilities seem to me to be divided between _Palembang_, and
  its colony _Singhapura_. Palembang, according to the Commentaries
  of Alboquerque, was called by the Javanese MALAYO. The List of
  Sumatran Kingdoms in De Barros makes TANA-MALAYU the _next_ to
  Palembang. On the whole, I incline to this interpretation.

  [In _Valentyn_ (V. 1, _Beschryvinge van Malakka_, p. 317) we find
  it stated that the Malay people just dwelt on the River _Malayu_
  in the Kingdom of Palembang, and were called from the River _Orang
  Malayu.—MS. Note._—H. Y.]

  [Professor Schlegel in his _Geog. Notes_, IV., tries to prove by
  Chinese authorities that Maliur and Tana-Malayu are two quite
  distinct countries, and he says that Maliur may have been situated
  on the coast opposite Singapore, perhaps a little more to the S.W.
  where now lies Malacca, and that Tana-Malayu may be placed in
  Asahan, upon the east coast of Sumatra.—H. C.]

  Singhapura was founded by an emigration from Palembang, itself a
  Javanese colony. It became the site of a flourishing kingdom, and
  was then, according to the tradition recorded by De Barros, the
  most important centre of population in those regions, “whither
  used to gather all the navigators of the Eastern Seas, from both
  East and West; to this great city of Singapura all flocked as to
  a general market.” (Dec. II. 6, 1.) This suits the description in
  our text well; but as Singhapura was in sight of any ship passing
  through the straits, mistake could hardly occur as to its position,
  even if it had not been visited.

  I omit _Malacca_ entirely from consideration, because the evidence
  appears to me conclusive against the existence of Malacca at this
  time.

  The Malay Chronology, as published by Valentyn, ascribes the
  foundation of that city to a king called Iskandar Shah, placing
  it in A.D. 1252, fixes the reign of Mahomed Shah, the third King
  of Malacca and first Mussulman King, as extending from 1276 to
  1333 (not stating _when_ his conversion took place), and gives 8
  kings in all between the foundation of the city and its capture by
  the Portuguese in 1511, a space, according to those data, of 259
  years. As Sri Iskandar Shah, the founder, had reigned 3 years in
  Singhapura _before_ founding Malacca, and Mahomed Shah, the loser,
  reigned 2 years in Johore _after_ the loss of his capital, we have
  264 years to divide among 8 kings, giving 33 years to each reign.
  This certainly indicates that the period requires considerable
  curtailment.

  Again, both De Barros and the Commentaries or Alboquerque ascribe
  the foundation of Malacca to a Javanese fugitive from Palembang
  called Paramisura, and Alboquerque makes Iskandar Shah (_Xaquem
  darxa_) the _son_ of Paramisura, and the first convert to
  Mahomedanism. _Four_ other kings reign in succession after him, the
  last of the four being Mahomed Shah, expelled in 1511.

  [Godinho de Eredia says expressly (Cap. i. _Do Citio Malaca_, p.
  4) that Malacca was founded by _Permicuri, primeiro monarcha de
  Malayos_, in the year 1411, in the Pontificate of John XXIV.,
  and in the reign of Don Juan II. of Castille and Dom Juan I. of
  Portugal.]

  The historian De Couto, whilst giving the same number of reigns
  from the conversion to the capture, places the former event about
  1384. And the Commentaries of Alboquerque allow no more than some
  ninety years from the foundation of Malacca to his capture of the
  city.

  There is another approximate check to the chronology afforded by
  a Chinese record in the XIVth volume of Amyot’s collection. This
  informs us that Malacca first acknowledged itself as tributary to
  the Empire in 1405, the king being _Sili-ju-eul-sula_ (?). In 1411
  the King of Malacca himself, now called _Peilimisula_ (Paramisura),
  came in person to the court of China to render homage. And in 1414
  the Queen-Mother of Malacca came to court, bringing her son’s
  tribute.

  Now this notable fact of the visit of a King of Malacca to the
  court of China, and his acknowledgment of the Emperor’s supremacy,
  is also recorded in the Commentaries of Alboquerque. This work, it
  is true, attributes the visit, not to Paramisura, the founder of
  Malacca, but to his son and successor Iskandar Shah. This may be
  a question of a _title_ only, perhaps borne by both; but we seem
  entitled to conclude with confidence that Malacca was founded by
  a prince whose son was reigning, and visited the court of China
  in 1411. And the real chronology will be about midway between the
  estimates of De Couto and of Alboquerque. Hence Malacca did not
  exist for a century, more or less, after Polo’s voyage.

  [Mr. C. O. Blagden, in a paper on the Mediæval Chronology of
  Malacca (_Actes du XIᵉ Cong. Int. Orient. Paris_, 1897), writes (p.
  249) that “if Malacca had been in the middle of the 14th century
  anything like the great emporium of trade which it certainly was in
  the 15th, Ibn Batuta would scarcely have failed to speak of it.”
  The foundation of Malacca by Sri Iskandar Shah in 1252, according
  to the _Sejarah Malayu_ “must be put at least 125 years later,
  and the establishment of the Muhammadan religion there would then
  precede by only a few years the end of the 14th century, instead of
  taking place about the end of the 13th, as is generally supposed”
  (p. 251). (Cf. _G. Schlegel, Geog. Notes_, XV.)—H. C.]

  Mr. Logan supposes that the form _Malayu-r_ may indicate that the
  Malay language of the 13th century “had not yet replaced the strong
  naso-guttural terminals by pure vowels.” We find the same form in a
  contemporary Chinese notice. This records that in the 2nd year of
  the Yuen, tribute was sent from Siam to the Emperor. “The Siamese
  had long been at war with the _Maliyi_ or MALIURH, but both nations
  laid aside their feud and submitted to China.” (_Valentyn_, V. p.
  352; _Crawford’s Desc. Dict._ art. _Malacca_; _Lassen_, IV. 541
  _seqq._; _Journ. Ind. Archip._ V. 572, II. 608–609; _De Barros_,
  Dec. II. 1. vi. c. 1; _Comentarios do grande Afonso d’Alboquerque_,
  Pt. III. cap. xvii.; _Couto_, Dec. IV. liv. ii.; _Wade_ in
  _Bowring’s Kingdom and People of Siam_, I. 72.)

  [From I-tsing we learn that going from China to India, the
  traveller visits the country of _Shih-li-fuh-shi_ (_Çrībhôja_
  or simply _Fuh-shi_ = Bhôja), then _Mo-louo-yu_, which seems to
  Professor Chavannes to correspond to the _Malaiur_ of Marco Polo
  and to the modern Palembang, and which in the 10th century formed
  a part of Çribhôdja identified by Professor Chavannes with Zabedj.
  (_I-tsing_, p. 36.) The Rev. S. Beal has some remarks on this
  question in the _Merveilles de l’Inde_, p. 251, and he says that
  he thinks “there are reasons for placing this country [Çrībhôja],
  or island, on the East coast of Sumatra, and near Palembang, or,
  on the Palembang River.” Mr. Groeneveldt (_T’oung Pao_, VII. abst.
  p. 10) gives some extracts from Chinese authors, and then writes:
  “We have therefore to find now a place for the Molayu of I-tsing,
  the Malaiur of Marco Polo, the Malayo of Alboquerque, and the
  Tana-Malayu of De Barros, all which may be taken to mean the same
  place. I-tsing tells us that it took fifteen days to go from Bhôja
  to Molayu and fifteen days again to go from there to Kieh-ch’a.
  The latter place, suggesting a native name Kada, must have been
  situated in the north-west of Sumatra, somewhere near the present
  Atjeh, for going from there west, one arrived in thirty days at
  Magapatana, near Ceylon, whilst a northern course brought one in
  ten days to the Nicobar Islands. Molayu should thus lie half-way
  between Bhôja and Kieh-ch’a, but this indication must not be taken
  too literally where it is given for a sailing vessel, and there
  is also the statement of De Barros, which does not allow us to go
  too far away from Palembang, as he mentions Tana-Malayu _next_ to
  that place. We have therefore to choose between the next three
  larger rivers: those of Jambi, Indragiri, and Kampar, and there
  is an indication in favour of the last one, not very strong, it
  is true, but still not to be neglected. I-tsing tells us: ‘Le
  roi me donna des secours grâce auxquels je parvins au pays de
  _Mo-louo-yu_; j’y séjournai derechef pendant deux mois. Je changeai
  de direction pour aller dans le pays de _Kie-tcha_.’ The change
  of direction during a voyage along the east coast of Sumatra from
  Palembang to Atjeh is nowhere very perceptible, because the course
  is throughout more or less north-west, still one may speak of a
  change of direction at the mouth of the River Kampar, about the
  entrance of the Strait of Malacca, whence the track begins to run
  more west, whilst it is more north before. The country of Kampar
  is of little importance now, but it is not improbable that there
  has been a Hindoo settlement, as the ruins of religious monuments
  decidedly Buddhist are still existing on the upper course of the
  river, the only ones indeed on this side of the island, it being
  a still unexplained fact that the Hindoos in Java have built on a
  very large scale, and those of Sumatra hardly anything at all.”—Mr.
  Takakusu (_A Record of the Buddhist Religion_, p. xli.) proposes to
  place Shih-li-fuh-shi at Palembang and Mo-louo-yu farther on the
  northern coast of Sumatra.—(Cf. _G. Schlegel, Geog. Notes_, XVI.;

                              CHAPTER IX.

        CONCERNING THE ISLAND OF JAVA THE LESS. THE KINGDOMS OF
                           FERLEC AND BASMA.


When you leave the Island of Pentam and sail about 100 miles, you reach
the Island of JAVA THE LESS. For all its name ’tis none so small but
that it has a compass of two thousand miles or more. Now I will tell
you all about this Island.{1}

You see there are upon it eight kingdoms and eight crowned kings. The
people are all Idolaters, and every kingdom has a language of its
own. The Island hath great abundance of treasure, with costly spices,
lign-aloes and spikenard and many others that never come into our
parts.{2}

Now I am going to tell you all about these eight kingdoms, or at least
the greater part of them. But let me premise one marvellous thing, and
that is the fact that this Island lies so far to the south that the
North Star, little or much, is never to be seen!

Now let us resume our subject, and first I will tell you of the kingdom
of FERLEC.

This kingdom, you must know, is so much frequented by the Saracen
merchants that they have converted the natives to the Law of Mahommet—I
mean the townspeople only, for the hill-people live for all the world
like beasts, and eat human flesh, as well as all other kinds of flesh,
clean or unclean. And they worship this, that, and the other thing; for
in fact the first thing that they see on rising in the morning, that
they do worship for the rest of the day.{3}

Having told you of the kingdom of Ferlec, I will now tell of another
which is called BASMA.

When you quit the kingdom of Ferlec you enter upon that of Basma.
This also is an independent kingdom, and the people have a language
of their own; but they are just like beasts without laws or religion.
They call themselves subjects of the Great Kaan, but they pay him no
tribute; indeed they are so far away that his men could not go thither.
Still all these Islanders declare themselves to be his subjects, and
sometimes they send him curiosities as presents.{4} There are wild
elephants in the country, and numerous unicorns, which are very nearly
as big. They have hair like that of a buffalo, feet like those of an
elephant, and a horn in the middle of the forehead, which is black
and very thick. They do no mischief, however, with the horn, but with
the tongue alone; for this is covered all over with long and strong
prickles [and when savage with any one they crush him under their knees
and then rasp him with their tongue]. The head resembles that of a wild
boar, and they carry it ever bent towards the ground. They delight much
to abide in mire and mud. ’Tis a passing ugly beast to look upon, and
is not in the least like that which our stories tell of as being caught
in the lap of a virgin; in fact, ’tis altogether different from what we
fancied.{5} There are also monkeys here in great numbers and of sundry
kinds; and goshawks as black as crows. These are very large birds and
capital for fowling.{6}

I may tell you moreover that when people bring home pygmies which they
allege to come from India, ’tis all a lie and a cheat. For those little
men, as they call them, are manufactured on this Island, and I will
tell you how. You see there is on the Island a kind of monkey which
is very small, and has a face just like a man’s. They take these, and
pluck out all the hair except the hair of the beard and on the breast,
and then they dry them and stuff them and daub them with saffron and
other things until they look like men. But you see it is all a cheat;
for nowhere in India nor anywhere else in the world were there ever men
seen so small as these pretended pygmies.

Now I will say no more of the kingdom of Basma, but tell you of the
others in succession.


  NOTE 1.—Java the Less is the Island of SUMATRA. Here there is
  no exaggeration in the dimension assigned to its circuit, which
  is about 2300 miles. The old Arabs of the 9th century give it a
  circuit of 800 parasangs, or say 2800 miles, and Barbosa reports
  the estimate of the Mahomedan seamen as 2100 miles. Compare the
  more reasonable accuracy of these estimates of Sumatra, which the
  navigators knew in its entire compass, with the wild estimates of
  Java Proper, of which they knew but the northern coast.

  Polo by no means stands alone in giving the name of Java to the
  island now called Sumatra. The terms _Jawa, Jawi_, were applied
  by the Arabs to the islands and productions of the Archipelago
  generally (_e.g._, _Lubán Jawí_, “Java frankincense,” whence by
  corruption _Benzoin_), but also specifically to Sumatra. Thus
  Sumatra is the _Jáwah_ both of Abulfeda and of Ibn Batuta, the
  latter of whom spent some time on the island, both in going to
  China and on his return. The Java also of the Catalan Map appears
  to be Sumatra. _Javaku_ again is the name applied in the Singalese
  chronicles to the Malays in general. _Jáu_ and _Dawa_ are the names
  still applied by the Battaks and the people of Nias respectively
  to the Malays, showing probably that these were looked on as
  Javanese by those tribes who did not partake of the civilisation
  diffused from Java. In Siamese also the Malay language is called
  _Chawa_; and even on the Malay peninsula, the traditional slang for
  a half-breed born from a Kling (or Coromandel) father and a Malay
  mother is _Jáwí Păkăn_, “a Jawi (_i.e._ Malay) of the market.” De
  Barros says that all the people of Sumatra called themselves by the
  common name of _Jauijs_. (Dec. III. liv. v. cap. 1.)

  There is some reason to believe that the application of the name
  Java to Sumatra is of very old date. For the oldest inscription
  of ascertained date in the Archipelago which has yet been read,
  a Sanskrit one from Pagaroyang, the capital of the ancient Malay
  state of Menang-kabau in the heart of Sumatra, bearing a date
  equivalent to A.D. 656, entitles the monarch whom it commemorates,
  Adityadharma by name, the king of “the First Java” (or rather
  Yava). This Mr. Friedrich interprets to mean Sumatra. It is by no
  means impossible that the _Iabadiu_, or Yávadvípa of Ptolemy may be
  Sumatra rather than Java.

  An accomplished Dutch Orientalist suggests that the Arabs
  originally applied the terms Great Java and Little Java to Java
  and Sumatra respectively, not because of their imagined relation
  in size, but as indicating the former to be Java _Proper_. Thus
  also, he says, there is a _Great Acheh_ (Achin) which does not
  imply that the place so called is greater than the well-known state
  of Achin (of which it is in fact a part), but because it is Acheh
  _Proper_. A like feeling may have suggested the Great Bulgaria,
  Great Hungary, Great Turkey of the mediæval travellers. These were,
  or were supposed to be, the original seats of the Bulgarians,
  Hungarians, and Turks. The _Great Horde_ of the Kirghiz Kazaks
  is, as regards numbers, not the greatest, but the smallest of the
  three. But the others look upon it as the most ancient. The Burmese
  are alleged to call the _Rakhain_ or people of Arakan _Mranma Gyí_
  or Great Burmese, and to consider their dialect the most ancient
  form of the language. And, in like manner, we may perhaps account
  for the term of _Little Thai_, formerly applied to the Siamese in
  distinction from the _Great Thai_, their kinsmen of Laos.

  In after-days, when the name of Sumatra for the Great Island had
  established itself, the traditional term “Little Java” sought other
  applications. Barbosa seems to apply it to _Sumbawa_; Pigafetta and
  Cavendish apply it to _Bali_, and in this way Raffles says it was
  still used in his own day. Geographers were sometimes puzzled about
  it. Magini says Java Minor is almost _incognita_.

  Stukken van het Bataksche Leesboek_, p. 43, etc.; _Friedrich_ in

  301.)

  NOTE 2.—As regards the _treasure_, Sumatra was long famous for its
  produce of gold. The export is estimated in Crawford’s History at
  35,530 ounces; but no doubt it was much more when the native states
  were in a condition of greater wealth and civilisation, as they
  undoubtedly were some centuries ago. Valentyn says that in some
  years Achin had exported 80 bahars, equivalent to 32,000 or 36,000
  lbs. avoirdupois (!). Of the other products named, lign-aloes or
  eagle-wood is a product of Sumatra, and is or was very abundant in
  Campar on the eastern coast. The _Ain-i-Akbari_ says this article
  was usually brought to India from _Achin_ and Tenasserim. Both this
  and _spikenard_ are mentioned by Polo’s contemporary, Kazwini, among
  the products of Java (probably Sumatra), viz., _Java lign-aloes
  (al-’Ud al-Jáwi)_, camphor _spikenard (Sumbul)_, etc. _Náráwastu_
  is the name of a grass with fragrant roots much used as a perfume
  in the Archipelago, and I see this is rendered _spikenard_ in
  a translation from the Malay Annals in the _Journal of the
  Archipelago_.

  With regard to the kingdoms of the island which Marco proceeds to
  describe, it is well to premise that all the six which he specifies
  are to be looked for towards the north end of the island, viz., in
  regular succession up the northern part of the east coast, along
  the north coast, and down the northern part of the west coast. This
  will be made tolerably clear in the details, and Marco himself
  intimates at the end of the next chapter that the six kingdoms he
  describes were all at _this_ side or end of the island: “_Or vos
  avon contée de cesti roiames que sunt de_ ceste _partie de scete
  ysle, et des autres roiames de_ l’autre _partie ne voz conteron-noz
  rien._” Most commentators have made confusion by scattering them up
  and down, nearly all round the coast of Sumatra. The best remarks
  on the subject I have met with are by Mr. Logan in his _Journal of
  the Ind. Arch._ II. 610.

  The “kingdoms” were certainly many more than eight throughout the
  island. At a later day De Barros enumerates 29 on the coast alone.
  Crawford reckons 15 different nations and languages on Sumatra and
  its dependent isles, of which 11 belong to the great island itself.

  Dict._ 119; _J. Ind. Arch._ V. 313.)

  NOTE 3.—The kingdom of PARLÁK is mentioned in the _Shijarat Malayu_
  or Malay Chronicle, and also in a Malay History of the Kings of
  Pasei, of which an abstract is given by Dulaurier, in connection
  with the other states of which we shall speak presently. It is also
  mentioned (_Barlak_), as a city of the Archipelago, by Rashiduddin.
  Of its extent we have no knowledge, but the position (probably of
  its northern extremity) is preserved in the native name, _Tanjong_
  (_i.e._ Cape) _Parlák_ of the N.E. horn of Sumatra, called by
  European seamen “Diamond Point,” whilst the river and town of
  _Perla_, about 32 miles south of that point, indicate, I have
  little doubt, the site of the old capital.[1] Indeed in Malombra’s
  Ptolemy (Venice, 1574), I find the next city of Sumatra beyond
  _Pacen_ marked as _Pulaca_.

  The form _Ferlec_ shows that Polo got it from the Arabs, who
  having no _p_ often replace that letter by _f_. It is notable that
  the Malay alphabet, which is that of the Arabic with necessary
  modifications, represents the sound _p_ not by the Persian _pe_
  (پ), but by the Arabic _fe_ (ف), with three dots instead of one (ڤ).

  A Malay chronicle of Achin dates the accession of the first
  Mahomedan king of that state, the nearest point of Sumatra to India
  and Arabia, in the year answering to A.D. 1205, and this is the
  earliest conversion among the Malays on record. It is doubtful,
  indeed, whether there _were_ Kings of _Achin_ in 1205, or for
  centuries after (unless indeed _Lambri_ is to be regarded as
  Achin), but the introduction of Islam may be confidently assigned
  to that age.

  The notice of the Hill-people, who lived like beasts and ate human
  flesh, presumably attaches to the Battas or Bataks, occupying high
  table-lands in the interior of Sumatra. They do not now extend
  north beyond lat. 3°. The interior of Northern Sumatra seems to
  remain a _terra incognita_, and even with the coast we are far less
  familiar than our ancestors were 250 years ago. The Battas are
  remarkable among cannibal nations as having attained or retained
  some degree of civilisation, and as being possessed of an alphabet
  and documents. Their anthropophagy is now professedly practised
  according to precise laws, and only in prescribed cases. Thus:
  (1) A commoner seducing a Raja’s wife must be eaten; (2) Enemies
  taken in battle _outside their village_ must be eaten _alive_;
  those taken in storming a village may be spared; (3) Traitors
  and spies have the same doom, but may ransom themselves for 60
  dollars a-head. There is nothing more horrible or extraordinary in
  all the stories of mediæval travellers than the _facts_ of this
  institution. (See _Junghuhn_, _Die Battaländer_, II. 158.) And it
  is evident that human flesh is also at times kept in the houses
  for food. Junghuhn, who could not abide Englishmen but was a great
  admirer of the Battas, tells how after a perilous and hungry flight
  he arrived in a friendly village, and the food that was offered by
  his hosts was the flesh of two prisoners who had been slaughtered
  the day before (I. 249). Anderson was also told of one of the most
  powerful Batta chiefs who would eat only such food, and took care
  to be supplied with it (225).

  The story of the Battas is that in old times their communities
  lived in peace and knew no such custom; but a Devil, _Nanalain_,
  came bringing strife, and introduced this man-eating, at a period
  which they spoke of (in 1840) as “three men’s lives ago,” or about
  210 years previous to that date. Junghuhn, with some enlargement of
  the time, is disposed to accept their story of the practice being
  comparatively modern. This cannot be, for their hideous custom
  is alluded to by a long chain of early authorities. Ptolemy’s
  anthropophagi may perhaps be referred to the smaller islands. But
  the Arab _Relations_ of the 9th century speak of man-eaters in
  Al-Ramni, undoubtedly Sumatra. Then comes our traveller, followed
  by Odoric, and in the early part of the 15th century by Conti, who
  names the _Batech_ cannibals. Barbosa describes them without naming
  them; Galvano (p. 108) speaks of them by name; as does De Barros.
  (Dec. III. liv. viii. cap. 1.)

  The practice of worshipping the first thing seen in the morning is
  related of a variety of nations. Pigafetta tells it of the people
  of Gilolo, and Varthema in his account of Java (which I fear is
  fiction) ascribes it to some people of that island. Richard Eden
  tells it of the Laplanders. (_Notes on Russia_, Hak. Soc. II. 224.)

  NOTE 4.—_Basma_, as Valentyn indicated, seems to be the PASEI of
  the Malays, which the Arabs probably called _Basam_ or the like,
  for the Portuguese wrote it PACEM. [Mr. J. T. Thomson writes
  (_Proc. R. G. S._ XX. p. 221) that of its actual position there can
  be no doubt, it being the Passier of modern charts.—H. C.] Pasei is
  mentioned in the Malay Chronicle as founded by Malik al-Ṣálih, the
  first Mussulman sovereign of Samudra, the next of Marco’s kingdoms.
  He assigned one of these states to each of his two sons, Malik
  al-Dháhir and Malik al-Mansúr; the former of whom was reigning at
  Samudra, and apparently over the whole coast, when Ibn Batuta was
  there (about 1346–47). There is also a Malay History of the Kings
  of Pasei to which reference has already been made.

  Somewhat later Pasei was a great and famous city. Majapahit,
  Malacca, and Pasei being reckoned the three great cities of the
  Archipelago. The stimulus of conversion to Islam had not taken
  effect on those Sumatran states at the time of Polo’s voyage, but
  it did so soon afterwards, and, low as they have now fallen, their
  power at one time was no delusion. Achin, which rose to be the
  chief of them, in 1615 could send against Portuguese Malacca an
  expedition of more than 500 sail, 100 of which were galleys larger
  than any then constructed in Europe, and carried from 600 to 800
  men each.

  [Dr. Schlegel writes to me that according to the Malay Dictionary
  of Von de Wall and Van der Tuuk, ii. 414–415, Polo’s _Basman_ is the
  Arab pronunciation of _Pasĕman_, the modern Ophir in West Sumatra;
  _Gūnung Pasĕman_ is Mount Ophir.—H. C.]

  [Illustration: The three Asiatic Rhinoceroses; (upper) Indicus,
    (middle) Sondaicus, (lower) Sumatranus.[2]]

  NOTE 5.—The elephant seems to abound in the forest-tracts
  throughout the whole length of Sumatra, and the species is now
  determined to be a distinct one (_E. Sumatranus_) from that of
  continental India and identical with that of Ceylon.[3] The
  Sumatran elephant in former days was caught and tamed extensively.
  Ibn Batuta speaks of 100 elephants in the train of Al Dháhir, the
  King of Sumatra Proper, and in the 17th century Beaulieu says the
  King of Achin had always 900. Giov. d’Empoli also mentions them
  at Pedir in the beginning of the 16th century; and see _Pasei
  Chronicle_ quoted in _J. As._ sér. IV. tom. ix. pp. 258–259. This
  speaks of elephants as used in war by the people of Pasei, and of
  elephant-hunts as a royal diversion. The _locus_ of that best of
  elephant stories, the elephant’s revenge on the tailor, was at
  Achin.

  As Polo’s account of the rhinoceros is evidently from nature, it
  is notable that he should not only _call_ it unicorn, but speak so
  precisely of its one horn, for the characteristic, if not the only,
  species on the island, is a two-horned one (_Rh. Sumatranus_),[4]
  and his mention of the buffalo-like hair applies only to this one.
  This species exists also on the Indo-Chinese continent and, it is
  believed, in Borneo. I have seen it in the Arakan forests as high
  as 19° 20′; one was taken not long since near Chittagong; and Mr.
  Blyth tells me a stray one has been seen in Assam or its borders.

  [Ibn Khordâdhbeh says (_De Goeje’s Transl._ p. 47) that rhinoceros
  is to be found in Kâmeroun (Assam), which borders on China. It has
  a horn, a cubit long, and two palms thick; when the horn is split,
  inside is found on the black ground the white figure of a man, a
  quadruped, a fish, a peacock or some other bird.—H. C.]

  [John Evelyn mentions among the curiosities kept in the Treasury at
  St. Denis: “A faire unicorne’s horn, sent by a K. of Persia, about
  7 foote long.” _Diary_, 1643, 12th Nov.—H. C.]

  What the Traveller says of the animals’ love of mire and mud is
  well illustrated by the manner in which the _Semangs_ or Negritoes
  of the Malay Peninsula are said to destroy him: “This animal ... is
  found frequently in marshy places, with its whole body immersed in
  the mud, and part of the head only visible.... Upon the dry weather
  setting in ... the mud becomes hard and crusted, and the rhinoceros
  cannot effect his escape without considerable difficulty and
  exertion. The Semangs prepare themselves with large quantities of
  combustible materials, with which they quietly approach the animal,
  who is aroused from his reverie by an immense fire over him, which
  being kept well supplied by the Semangs with fresh fuel, soon
  completes his destruction, and renders him in a fit state to make a
  meal of.” (_J. Ind. Arch._ IV. 426.)[5] There is a great difference
  in aspect between the one-horned species (_Rh. Sondaicus_ and
  _Rh. Indicus_) and the two-horned. The Malays express what that
  difference is admirably, in calling the last _Bádak-Karbáu_,
  “the Buffalo-Rhinoceros,” and the Sondaicus _Bádak-Gájah_, “the
  Elephant-Rhinoceros.”

  The belief in the formidable nature of the tongue of the rhinoceros
  is very old and wide-spread, though I can find no foundation for
  it but the rough _appearance_ of the organ. [“His tongue also is
  somewhat of a rarity, for, if he can get any of his antagonists
  down, he will lick them so clean, that he leaves neither skin nor
  flesh to cover his bones.” (_A. Hamilton_, ed. 1727, II. 24. _M.S.
  Note of Yule_.) Compare what is said of the tongue of the Yak, I.
  p. 277.—H. C.] The Chinese have the belief, and the Jesuit Lecomte
  attests it from professed observation of the animal in confinement.
  (_Chin. Repos._ VII. 137; _Lecomte_, II. 406.) [In a Chinese
  work quoted by Mr. Groeneveldt (_T’oung Pao_, VII. No. 2, abst.
  p. 19) we read that “the rhinoceros has thorns on its tongue and
  always eats the thorns of plants and trees, but never grasses or
  leaves.”—H. C.]

  The legend to which Marco alludes, about the Unicorn allowing
  itself to be ensnared by a maiden (and of which Marsden has made
  an odd perversion in his translation, whilst indicating the true
  meaning in his note), is also an old and general one. It will be
  found, for example, in Brunetto Latini, in the _Image du Monde_,
  in the _Mirabilia_ of Jordanus,[6] and in the verses of Tzetzes.
  The latter represents Monoceros as attracted not by the maiden’s
  charms but by her perfumery. So he is inveigled and blindfolded by
  a stout young knave, disguised as a maiden and drenched with scent:—

    “’Tis then the huntsmen hasten up, abandoning their ambush;
     Clean from his head they chop his horn, prized antidote to poison;
     And let the docked and luckless beast escape into the jungles.”
                                                      —V. 399, _seqq._

  In the cut which we give of this from a mediæval source the horn of
  the unicorn is evidently the tusk of a _narwhal_. This confusion
  arose very early, as may be seen from its occurrence in Aelian,
  who says that the horn of the unicorn or _Kartazōnon_ (the Arab
  _Karkaddan_ or Rhinoceros) was not straight but twisted (ἐλιγμούς
  ἔχον τινάς, Hist. An. xvi. 20). The mistake may also be traced in
  the illustrations to Cosmas Indicopleustes from his own drawings,
  and it long endured, as may be seen in Jerome Cardan’s description
  of a unicorn’s horn which he saw suspended in the church of St.
  Denis; as well as in a circumstance related by P. della Valle (II.
  491; and Cardan, _de Varietate_, c. xcvii.). Indeed the supporter
  of the Royal arms retains the narwhal horn. To this popular error
  is no doubt due the reading in Pauthier’s text, which makes the
  horn _white_ instead of black.

  [Illustration: Monoceros and the Maiden.[7]]

  We may quote the following quaint version of the fable from the
  Bestiary of Philip de Thaun, published by Mr. Wright (_Popular
  Treatises on Science_, etc. p. 81):

      “Monosceros est Beste, un corne ad en la teste,
       Purceo ad si a nun, de buc ad façun;
       Par Pucele est prise; or vez en quel guise.
         Quant hom le volt cacer et prendre et enginner,
       Si vent hom al forest ù sis riparis est;
       Là met une Pucele hors de sein sa mamele,
       Et par odurement Monosceros la sent;
       Dunc vent à la Pucele, et si baiset la mamele,
       En sein devant se dort, issi vent à sa mort
       Li hom suivent atant ki l’ocit en dormant
       U trestout vif le prent, si fais puis sun talent.
       Grant chose signifie.”....

  And so goes on to moralise the fable.

  NOTE 6.—In the _J. Indian Archip._ V. 285, there is mention of the
  _Falco Malaiensis_, black, with a double white-and-brown spotted
  tail, said to belong to the ospreys, “but does not disdain to take
  birds and other game.”

                              CHAPTER X.

                 THE KINGDOMS OF SAMARA AND DAGROIAN.


So you must know that when you leave the kingdom of Basma you come
to another kingdom called Samara, on the same Island.{1} And in that
kingdom Messer Marco Polo was detained five months by the weather,
which would not allow of his going on. And I tell you that here again
neither the Pole-star nor the stars of the Maestro{2} were to be seen,
much or little. The people here are wild Idolaters; they have a king
who is great and rich; but they also call themselves subjects of the
Great Kaan. When Messer Mark was detained on this Island five months
by contrary winds, [he landed with about 2000 men in his company;
they dug large ditches on the landward side to encompass the party,
resting at either end on the sea-haven, and within these ditches they
made bulwarks or stockades of timber] for fear of those brutes of
man-eaters; [for there is great store of wood there; and the Islanders
having confidence in the party supplied them with victuals and other
things needful.] There is abundance of fish to be had, the best in the
world. The people have no wheat, but live on rice. Nor have they any
wine except such as I shall now describe.

You must know that they derive it from a certain kind of tree that they
have. When they want wine they cut a branch of this, and attach a great
pot to the stem of the tree at the place where the branch was cut; in a
day and a night they will find the pot filled. This wine is excellent
drink, and is got both white and red. [It is of such surpassing virtue
that it cures dropsy and tisick and spleen.] The trees resemble small
date-palms; ... and when cutting a branch no longer gives a flow of
wine, they water the root of the tree, and before long the branches
again begin to give out wine as before.{3} They have also great
quantities of Indian nuts [as big as a man’s head], which are good to
eat when fresh; [being sweet and savoury, and white as milk. The inside
of the meat of the nut is filled with a liquor like clear fresh water,
but better to the taste, and more delicate than wine or any other drink
that ever existed.]

Now that we have done telling you about this kingdom, let us quit it,
and we will tell you of Dagroian.

When you leave the kingdom of Samara you come to another which is
called DAGROIAN. It is an independent kingdom, and has a language
of its own. The people are very wild, but they call themselves the
subjects of the Great Kaan. I will tell you a wicked custom of
theirs.{4}

When one of them is ill they send for their sorcerers, and put the
question to them, whether the sick man shall recover of his sickness
or no. If they say that he will recover, then they let him alone till
he gets better. But if the sorcerers foretell that the sick man is to
die, the friends send for certain judges of theirs to put to death him
who has thus been condemned by the sorcerers to die. These men come,
and lay so many clothes upon the sick man’s mouth that they suffocate
him. And when he is dead they have him cooked, and gather together all
the dead man’s kin, and eat him. And I assure you they do suck the very
bones till not a particle of marrow remains in them; for they say that
if any nourishment remained in the bones this would breed worms, and
then the worms would die for want of food, and the death of those worms
would be laid to the charge of the deceased man’s soul. And so they eat
him up stump and rump. And when they have thus eaten him they collect
his bones and put them in fine chests, and carry them away, and place
them in caverns among the mountains where no beast nor other creature
can get at them. And you must know also that if they take prisoner a
man of another country, and he cannot pay a ransom in coin, they kill
him and eat him straightway. It is a very evil custom and a parlous.{5}

Now that I have told you about this kingdom let us leave it, and I will
tell you of Lambri.


  NOTE 1.—I have little doubt that in Marco’s dictation the name was
  really _Samatra_, and it is possible that we have a trace of this
  in the _Samarcha_ (for _Samartha_) of the Crusca MS.

  The _Shijarat Malayu_ has a legend, with a fictitious etymology, of
  the foundation of the city and kingdom of _Samudra_, or SUMATRA,
  by Marah Silu, a fisherman near Pasangan, who had acquired great
  wealth, as wealth is got in fairy tales. The name is probably
  the Sanskrit _Samudra_, “the sea.” Possibly it may have been
  imitated from Dwára Samudra, at that time a great state and city of
  Southern India. [We read in the Malay Annals, _Salalat al Salatin_,
  translated by Mr. J. T. Thomson (_Proc. R. G. S._ XX. p. 216):
  “Mara Silu ascended the eminence, when he saw an ant as big as a
  cat; so he caught it, and ate it, and on the place he erected his
  residence, which he named Samandara, which means Big Ant (_Semut
  besar_ in Malay).”—H. C.] Mara Silu having become King of Samudra
  was converted to Islam, and took the name of Malik al-Ṣálih. He
  married the daughter of the King of _Parlák_, by whom he had two
  sons; and to have a principality for each he founded the city and
  kingdom of _Pasei_. Thus we have Marco’s three first kingdoms,
  Ferlec, Basma, and Samara, connected together in a satisfactory
  manner in the Malayan story. It goes on to relate the history of
  the two sons Al-Dháhir and Al-Mansúr. Another version is given in
  the history of Pasei already alluded to, with such differences as
  might be expected when the oral traditions of several centuries
  came to be written down.

  Ibn Batuta, about 1346, on his way to China, spent fifteen days at
  the court of Samudra, which he calls _Sămăthrah_ or _Sămŭthrah_.
  The king whom he found there reigning was the Sultan Al-Malik
  Al-Dháhir, a most zealous Mussulman, surrounded by doctors of
  theology, and greatly addicted to religious discussions, as well
  as a great warrior and a powerful prince. The city was 4 miles
  from its port, which the traveller calls _Sărha_; he describes the
  capital as a large and fine town, surrounded with an enceinte and
  bastions of timber. The court displayed all the state of Mahomedan
  royalty, and the Sultan’s dominions extended for many days along
  the coast. In accordance with Ibn Batuta’s picture, the Malay
  Chronicle represents the court of Pasei (which we have seen to be
  intimately connected with Samudra) as a great focus of theological
  studies about this time.

  There can be little doubt that Ibn Batuta’s Malik Al-Dháhir is
  the prince of the Malay Chronicle, the son of the first Mahomedan
  king. We find in 1292 that Marco says nothing of Mahomedanism; the
  people are still wild idolaters; but the king is already a rich
  and powerful prince. This may have been Malik al-Ṣálih before his
  conversion; but it may be doubted if the Malay story be correct
  in representing him as the _founder_ of the city. Nor is this
  apparently so represented in the Book of the Kings of Pasei.

  Before Ibn Batuta’s time, Sumatra or Samudra appears in the
  travels of Fr. Odoric. After speaking of _Lamori_ (to which we
  shall come presently), he says: “In the same island, towards
  the south, is another kingdom, by name SUMOLTRA, in which is a
  singular generation of people, for they brand themselves on the
  face with a hot iron in some twelve places,” etc. This looks as if
  the conversion to Islam was still (_circa_ 1323) very incomplete.
  Rashiduddin also speaks of _Súmútra_ as lying beyond Lamuri.
  (_Elliot_, I. p. 70.)

  The power attained by the dynasty of Malik al-Ṣálih, and the number
  of Mahomedans attracted to his court, probably led in the course
  of the 14th century to the extension of the name of Sumatra to the
  whole island. For when visited early in the next century by Nicolo
  Conti, we are told that he “went to a fine city of the island of
  Taprobana, which island is called by the natives _Shamuthera_.”
  Strange to say, he speaks of the natives as all idolaters. Fra
  Mauro, who got much from Conti, gives us _Isola Siamotra_ over
  _Taprobana_; and it shows at once his own judgment and want of
  confidence in it, when he notes elsewhere that “Ptolemy, professing
  to describe Taprobana, has really only described Saylan.”

  We have no means of settling the exact position of the city of
  Sumatra, though possibly an enquiry among the natives of that
  coast might still determine the point. Marsden and Logan indicate
  Samarlanga, but I should look for it nearer Pasei. As pointed out
  by Mr. Braddell in the _J. Ind. Arch._, Malay tradition represents
  the site of Pasei as selected on a hunting expedition from Samudra,
  which seems to imply tolerable proximity. And at the marriage of
  the Princess of Parlak to Malik Al-Ṣálih, we are told that the
  latter went to receive her on landing at Jambu Ayer (near Diamond
  Point), and thence conducted her to the city of Samudra. I should
  seek Samudra near the head of the estuary-like Gulf of Pasei,
  called in the charts _Telo_ (or Talak) _Samawe_; a place very
  likely to have been sought as a shelter to the Great Kaan’s fleet
  during the south-west monsoon. Fine timber, of great size, grows
  close to the shore of this bay,[1] and would furnish material for
  Marco’s stockades.

  When the Portuguese first reached those regions Pedir was the
  leading state upon the coast, and certainly no state _called_
  Sumatra continued to exist. Whether the _city_ continued to exist
  even in decay is not easy to discern. The _Aín-i-Akbari_ says that
  the best civet is that which is brought from _the seaport town of
  Sumatra, in the territory of Achin_, and is called _Sumatra Zabád_;
  but this may have been based on old information. Valentyn seems
  to recognise the existence of a place of note called _Samadra_ or
  _Samotdara_, though it is not entered on his map. A famous mystic
  theologian who flourished under the great King of Achin, Iskandar
  Muda, and died in 1630, bore the name of Shamsuddín _Shamatráni_,
  which seems to point to the city of Sumatra as his birth place.[2]
  The most distinct mention that I know of the city so called, in the
  Portuguese period, occurs in the _soi-disant_ “Voyage which Juan
  Serano made when he fled from Malacca,” in 1512, published by Lord
  Stanley of Alderley, at the end of his translation of Barbosa. This
  man speaks of the “island of Samatra” as named from “_a city of
  this northern part_.” And on leaving Pedir, having gone down the
  northern coast, he says, “I drew towards the south and south-east
  direction, and reached to another country and city which is called
  Samatra,” and so on. Now this describes the position in which the
  city of Sumatra should have been if it existed. But all the rest of
  the tract is mere plunder from Varthema.[3]

  There is, however, a like intimation in a curious letter respecting
  the Portuguese discoveries, written from Lisbon in 1515, by a
  German, Valentine Moravia, who was probably the same Valentyn
  Fernandez, the German, who published the Portuguese edition of
  Marco Polo at Lisbon in 1502, and who shows an extremely accurate
  conception of Indian geography. He says: “La maxima insula la quale
  è chiamata da Marcho Polo Veneto Iava Minor, et al presente si
  chiama _Sumotra_, da un _emporie di dicta insula_” (printed by _De
  Gubernatis, Viagg. Ita._ etc., p. 170).

  Several considerations point to the probability that the states of
  Pasei and Sumatra had become united, and that the town of Sumatra
  may have been represented by the Pacem of the Portuguese.[4] I have
  to thank Mr. G. Phillips for the copy of a small Chinese chart
  showing the northern coast of the island, which he states to be
  from “one of about the 13th century.” I much doubt the date, but
  the map is valuable as showing the town of Sumatra (_Sumantala_).
  This seems to be placed in the Gulf of Pasei, and very near where
  Pasei itself still exists. An extract of a “Chinese account of
  about A.D. 1413” accompanied the map. This states that the town
  was situated some distance up a river, so as to be reached in
  two tides. There was a village at the mouth of the river called
  _Talumangkin_.[5]

  [Mr. E. H. Parker writes (_China Review_, XXIV. p. 102): “Colonel
  Yule’s remarks about Pasei are borne out by Chinese History (Ming,
  325, 20, 24), which states that in 1521 Pieh-tu-lu (Pestrello [for
  Perestrello?]) having failed in China ‘went for’ _Pa-si_. Again
  ‘from Pa-si, Malacca, to Luzon, they swept the seas, and all the
  other nations were afraid of them.’”—H. C.]

  Among the Indian states which were prevailed on to send tribute (or
  presents) to Kúblái in 1286, we find _Sumutala_. The chief of this
  state is called in the Chinese record _Tu-‘han-pa-ti_, which seems
  to be just the Malay words _Tuan Pati_, “Lord Ruler.” No doubt this
  was the rising state of Sumatra, of which we have been speaking;
  for it will be observed that Marco says the people of that state
  called themselves the Kaan’s subjects. Rashiduddin makes the same
  statement regarding the people of Java (_i.e._ the island of
  Sumatra), and even of Nicobar: “They are all subject to the Kaan.”
  It is curious to find just the same kind of statements about the
  princes of the Malay Islands acknowledging themselves subjects of
  Charles V., in the report of the surviving commander of Magellan’s
  ship to that emperor (printed by Baldelli-Boni, I. lxvii.).
  Pauthier has curious Chinese extracts containing a notable passage
  respecting the disappearance of Sumatra Proper from history: “In
  the years _Wen-chi_ (1573–1615), the Kingdom of Sumatra divided in
  two, and the new state took the name of _Achi_ (Achin). After that
  Sumatra was no more heard of.” (_Gaubil_, 205; _De Mailla_, IX.
  429; _Elliot_, I. 71; _Pauthier_, pp. 605 and 567.)

  NOTE 2.—“_Vos di que la Tramontaine ne part. Et encore vos di que
  l’estoilles dou Meistre ne aparent ne pou ne grant_” (G. T.). The
  _Tramontaine_ is the Pole star:—

      “De nostre Père l’Apostoille
       Volsisse qu’il semblast l’estoile
       Qui ne se muet ...
       Par cele estoile vont et viennent
       Et lor sen et lor voie tiennent
       Il l’apelent la _tres montaigne_.”
      —_La Bible Guiot de Provins_ in _Barbazan_, by _Méon_, II. 377.

  The _Meistre_ is explained by Pauthier to be Arcturus; but this
  makes Polo’s error greater than it is. Brunetto Latini says:
  “Devers la tramontane en a il i. autre (vent) plus debonaire, qui a
  non _Chorus_. Cestui apelent li marinier MAISTRE _por vij. estoiles
  qui sont en celui meisme leu_,” etc. (_Li Tresors_, p. 122).
  _Magister_ or _Magistra_ in mediæval Latin, _La Maistre_ in old
  French, signifies “the beam of a plough.” Possibly this accounts
  for the application of _Maistre_ to the Great Bear, or _Plough_.
  But on the other hand the pilot’s art is called in old French
  _maistrance_. Hence this constellation may have had the name as the
  pilot’s guide,—like our _Lode_-star. The name was probably given
  to the N.W. point under a latitude in which the Great Bear sets in
  that quarter. In this way many of the points of the old Arabian
  _Rose des Vents_ were named from the rising or setting of certain
  constellations. (See _Reinaud’s Abulfeda_, Introd. pp. cxcix.–cci.)

  NOTE 3.—The tree here intended, and which gives the chief supply of
  toddy and sugar in the Malay Islands, is the _Areng Saccharifera_
  (from the Javanese name), called by the Malays _Gomuti_, and by the
  Portuguese _Saguer_. It has some resemblance to the date-palm, to
  which Polo compares it, but it is a much coarser and wilder-looking
  tree, with a general raggedness, “_incompta et adspectu tristis_,”
  as Rumphius describes it. It is notable for the number of plants
  that find a footing in the joints of its stem. On one tree in Java
  I have counted thirteen species of such parasites, nearly all
  ferns. The tree appears in the foreground of the cut at p. 273.

  Crawford thus describes its treatment in obtaining toddy: “One
  of the _spathae_, or shoots of fructification, is, on the first
  appearance of the fruit, beaten for three successive days with a
  small stick, with the view of determining the sap to the wounded
  part. The shoot is then cut off, a little way from the root, and
  the liquor which pours out is received in pots.... The _Gomuti_
  palm is fit to yield toddy at 9 or 10 years old, and continues
  to yield it for 2 years at the average rate of 3 quarts a day.”
  (_Hist. of Ind. Arch._ I. 398.)

  The words omitted in translation are unintelligible to me: “_et
  sunt quatre raimes trois cel en_.” (G. T.)

  [“Polo’s description of the wine-pots of Samara hung on the trees
  ‘like date-palms,’ agrees precisely with the Chinese account of
  the _shu theu tsiu_ made from ‘coir trees like cocoa-nut palms’
  manufactured by the Burmese. Therefore it seems more likely that
  Samara is Siam (still pronounced _Shumuro_ in Japan, and _Siamlo_
  in Hakka), than Sumatra.” (_Parker_, _China Review_, XIV. p. 359.)
  I think it useless to discuss this theory.—H. C.]

  NOTE 4.—No one has been able to identify this state. Its position,
  however, must have been near PEDIR, and perhaps it was practically
  the same. Pedir was the most flourishing of those Sumatran states
  at the appearance of the Portuguese.

  Rashiduddin names among the towns of the Archipelago _Dalmian_,
  which may perhaps be a corrupt transcript of Dagroian.

  Mr. Phillips’s Chinese extracts, already cited, state that west of
  Sumatra (proper) were two small kingdoms, the first _Nakú-urh_,
  the second _Liti_. Nakú-urh, which seems to be the _Ting-’ho-’rh_
  of Pauthier’s extracts, which sent tribute to the Kaan, and may
  probably be Dagroian as Mr. Phillips supposes, was also called the
  _Kingdom of Tattooed Folk_.

  [Mr. G. Phillips wrote since (_J. R. A. S._, July 1895, p. 528):
  “Dragoian has puzzled many commentators, but on (a) Chinese chart
  ... there is a country called _Ta-hua-mien_, which in the Amoy
  dialect is pronounced _Dakolien_, in which it is very easy to
  recognise the Dragoian, or Dagoyam, of Marco Polo.” In his paper of
  _The Seaports of India and Ceylon_ (_Jour. China B. R. A. S._, xx.
  1885, p. 221), Mr. Phillips, referring to his Chinese Map, already
  said: _Ta-hsiao-hua-mien_, in the Amoy dialect _Toa-sio-hoe_ (or
  _Ko_)-_bin_, “The Kingdom of the Greater and Lesser Tattooed
  Faces.” The Toa-Ko-bin, the greater tattooed-face people, most
  probably represents the Dagroian, or Dagoyum, of Marco Polo. This
  country was called _Na-ku-êrh_, and Ma Huan says, “the King of
  _Na-ku-êrh_ is also called the King of the Tattooed Faces.”—H. C.]

  Tattooing is ascribed by Friar Odoric to the people of _Sumoltra_.
  (_Cathay_, p. 86.) _Liti_ is evidently the _Lidé_ of De Barros,
  which by his list lay immediately east of Pedir. This would place
  Nakú-urh about Samarlangka. Beyond _Liti_ was _Lanmoli_ (_i.e._
  Lambri). [See _G. Schlegel_, _Geog. Notes_, XVI. Li-taï, Nakur.—H.
  C.]

  There is, or was fifty years ago, a small port between Ayer Labu
  and Samarlangka, called _Darián_-Gadé (_Great_ Darian?). This is
  the nearest approach to Dagroian that I have met with. (_N. Ann.
  des V._, tom. xviii. p. 16.)

  NOTE 5.—Gasparo Balbi (1579–1587) heard the like story of the
  Battas under Achin. True or false, the charge against them has come
  down to our times. The like is told by Herodotus of the Paddaei in
  India, of the Massagetæ, and of the Issedonians; by Strabo of the
  Caspians and of the Derbices; by the Chinese of one of the wild
  tribes of Kwei-chau; and was told to Wallace of some of the Aru
  Island tribes near New Guinea, and to Bickmore of a tribe on the
  south coast of Floris, called _Rakka_ (probably a form of Hindu
  _Rákshasa_, or ogre-goblin). Similar charges are made against
  sundry tribes of the New World, from Brazil to Vancouver Island.
  Odoric tells precisely Marco’s story of a certain island called
  Dondin. And in “King Alisaunder,” the custom is related of a people
  of India, called most inappropriately _Orphani_:—

      “Another Folk woneth there beside;
       _Orphani_ he hatteth wide.
       When her eldrynges beth elde,
       And ne mowen hemselven welde
       Hy hem sleeth, and bidelve
       And,” etc., etc.         —_Weber_, I. p. 206.

  Benedetto Bordone, in his _Isolario_ (1521 and 1547), makes the
  same charge against the _Irish_, but I am glad to say that this
  seems only copied from Strabo. Such stories are still rife in the
  East, like those of men with tails. I have myself heard the tale
  told, nearly as Raffles tells it of the Battas, of some of the
  wild tribes adjoining Arakan. (_Balbi_, f. 130; _Raffles_, Mem. p.
  427; _Wallace, Malay Archip._ 281; _Bickmore’s Travels_, p. 111;
  _Cathay_, pp. 25, 100).

  The latest and most authentic statement of the kind refers to
  a small tribe called _Birhōrs_, existing in the wildest parts
  of Chota Nagpúr and Jashpúr, west of Bengal, and is given by
  an accomplished Indian ethnologist, Colonel Dalton. “They were
  wretched-looking objects ... assuring me that they had themselves
  given up the practice, they admitted that their fathers were in the
  habit of disposing of their dead in the manner indicated, viz., by
  feasting on the bodies; but they declared that they never shortened
  life to provide such feast, and shrunk with horror at the idea of
  any bodies but those of their own blood relations being served up
  at them!” (_J. A. S. B._ XXXIV. Pt. II. 18.) The same practice has
  been attributed recently, but only on hearsay, to a tribe of N.
  Guinea called _Tarungares_.

  The Battas now bury their dead, after keeping the body a
  considerable time. But the people of Nias and the Batu Islands,
  whom Junghuhn considers to be of common origin with the Battas, do
  not bury, but expose the bodies in coffins upon rocks by the sea.
  And the small and very peculiar people of the Paggi Islands expose
  their dead on bamboo platforms in the forest. It is quite probable
  that such customs existed in the north of Sumatra also; indeed
  they may still exist, for the interior seems unknown. We do hear
  of pagan hill-people inland from Pedir who make descents upon the
  coast. (_Junghuhn_ II. 140; _Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal_, etc.,
  2nd year, No. 4; _Nouv. Ann. des. V._ XVIII.)

                              CHAPTER XI.

                 OF THE KINGDOMS OF LAMBRI AND FANSUR.


When you leave that kingdom you come to another which is called LAMBRI.
{1} The people are Idolaters, and call themselves the subjects of the
Great Kaan. They have plenty of Camphor and of all sorts of other
spices. They also have brazil in great quantities. This they sow, and
when it is grown to the size of a small shoot they take it up and
transplant it; then they let it grow for three years, after which they
tear it up by the root. You must know that Messer Marco Polo aforesaid
brought some seed of the brazil, such as they sow, to Venice with him,
and had it sown there; but never a thing came up. And I fancy it was
because the climate was too cold.

Now you must know that in this kingdom of Lambri there are men with
tails; these tails are of a palm in length, and have no hair on them.
These people live in the mountains and are a kind of wild men. Their
tails are about the thickness of a dog’s.{2} There are also plenty of
unicorns in that country, and abundance of game in birds and beasts.

Now then I have told you about the kingdom of Lambri.

You then come to another kingdom which is called FANSUR. The people are
Idolaters, and also call themselves subjects of the Great Kaan; and
understand, they are still on the same Island that I have been telling
you of. In this kingdom of Fansur grows the best Camphor in the world
called _Canfora Fansuri_. It is so fine that it sells for its weight in
fine gold.{3}

The people have no wheat, but have rice which they eat with milk and
flesh. They also have wine from trees such as I told you of. And I
will tell you another great marvel. They have a kind of trees that
produce flour, and excellent flour it is for food. These trees are
very tall and thick, but have a very thin bark, and inside the bark
they are crammed with flour. And I tell you that Messer Marco Polo,
who witnessed all this, related how he and his party did sundry times
partake of this flour made into bread, and found it excellent.{4}

There is now no more to relate. For out of those eight kingdoms we have
told you about six that lie at this side of the Island. I shall tell
you nothing about the other two kingdoms that are at the other side of
the Island, for the said Messer Marco Polo never was there. Howbeit we
have told you about the greater part of this Island of the Lesser Java:
so now we will quit it, and I will tell you of a very small Island that
is called GAUENISPOLA.{5}


  NOTE 1.—The name of Lambri is not now traceable on our maps, nor on
  any list of the ports of Sumatra that I have met with; but in old
  times the name occurs frequently under one form or another, and its
  position can be assigned generally to the north part of the west
  coast, commencing from the neighbourhood of Achin Head.

  De Barros, detailing the twenty-nine kingdoms which divided the
  coast of Sumatra, at the beginning of the Portuguese conquests,
  begins with _Daya_, and then passes round by the north. He names
  as next in order LAMBRIJ, and then _Achem_. This would make Lambri
  lie between Daya and Achin, for which there is but little room. And
  there is an apparent inconsistency; for in coming round again from
  the south, his 28th kingdom is _Quinchel_ (_Singkel_ of our modern
  maps), the 29th _Mancopa_, “which _falls upon Lambrij_, which
  adjoins Daya, the first that we named.” Most of the data about
  Lambri render it very difficult to distinguish it from Achin.

  The name of Lambri occurs in the Malay Chronicle, in the account of
  the first Mahomedan mission to convert the Island. We shall quote
  the passage in a following note.

  The position of Lambri would render it one of the first points of
  Sumatra made by navigators from Arabia and India; and this seems
  at one time to have caused the name to be applied to the whole
  Island. Thus Rashiduddin speaks of the very large Island LÁMÚRI
  lying beyond Ceylon, and adjoining the country of _Sumatra_; Odoric
  also goes from India across the Ocean to a certain country called
  LAMORI, where he began to lose sight of the North Star. He also
  speaks of the camphor, gold, and lign-aloes which it produced,
  and proceeds thence to _Sumoltra_ in the same Island.[1] It is
  probable that the _verzino_ or brazil-wood of _Ameri_ (L’Ameri,
  _i.e._ Lambri?) which appears in the mercantile details of
  Pegolotti was from this part of Sumatra. It is probable also that
  the country called _Nanwuli_, which the Chinese Annals report, with
  _Sumuntula_ and others, to have sent tribute to the Great Kaan
  in 1286, was this same Lambri which Polo tells us called itself
  subject to the Kaan.

  In the time of the Sung Dynasty ships from T’swan-chau (or Zayton)
  bound for _Tashi_, or Arabia, used to sail in forty days to a place
  called _Lanli-poï_ (probably this is also Lambri, _Lambri-puri?_).
  There they passed the winter, _i.e._ the south-west monsoon,
  just as Marco Polo’s party did at Sumatra, and sailing again
  when the wind became fair, they reached Arabia in sixty days.
  (_Bretschneider_, p. 16.)

  [The theory of Sir H. Yule is confirmed by Chinese authors quoted
  by Mr. Groeneveldt (_Notes on the Malay Archipelago_, pp. 98–100):
  “The country of Lambri is situated due west of Sumatra, at a
  distance of three days sailing with a fair wind; it lies near the
  sea and has a population of only about a thousand families.... On
  the east the country is bordered by Litai, on the west and the
  north by the sea, and on the south by high mountains, at the south
  of which is the sea again.... At the north-west of this country, in
  the sea, at a distance of half a day, is a flat mountain, called
  the Hat-island; the sea at the west of it is the great ocean, and
  is called the Ocean of Lambri. Ships coming from the west all
  take this island as a landmark.” Mr. Groeneveldt adds: “Lambri
  [according to his extracts from Chinese authors] must have been
  situated on the north-western corner of the island of Sumatra, on
  or near the spot of the present Achin: we see that it was bounded
  by the sea on the north and the west, and that the Indian Ocean was
  called after this insignificant place, because it was considered to
  begin there. Moreover, the small island at half a day’s distance,
  called Hat-island, perfectly agrees with the small islands Bras
  or Nasi, lying off Achin, and of which the former, with its
  newly-erected lighthouse, is a landmark for modern navigation, just
  what it is said in our text to have been for the natives then.
  We venture to think that the much discussed situation of Marco
  Polo’s Lambri is definitely settled herewith.” The Chinese author
  writes: “The mountains [of Lambri] produce the fragrant wood called
  _Hsiang-chên Hsiang_.” Mr. Groeneveldt remarks (_l.c._ p. 143)
  that this “is the name of a fragrant wood, much used as incense,
  but which we have not been able to determine. Dr. Williams says
  it comes from Sumatra, where it is called laka-wood, and is the
  product of a tree to which the name of _Tanarius major_ is given by
  him. For different reasons, we think this identification subject to
  doubt.”

  NOTE 2.—Stories of tailed or hairy men are common in the
  Archipelago, as in many other regions. Kazwini tells of the hairy
  little men that are found in Rámni (Sumatra) with a language like
  birds’ chirping. Marsden was told of hairy people called _Orang
  Gugu_ in the interior of the Island, who differed little, except
  in the use of speech, from the Orang utang. Since his time a
  French writer, giving the same name and same description, declares
  that he saw “a group” of these hairy people on the coast of
  Andragiri, and was told by them that they inhabited the interior
  of Menangkabau and formed a small tribe. It is rather remarkable
  that this writer makes no allusion to Marsden though his account
  is so nearly identical (_L’Océanie_ in _L’Univers Pittoresque_,
  I. 24.) [One of the stories of the _Merveilles de l’Inde_ (p.
  125) is that there are anthropophagi with tails at Lulu bilenk
  between Fansur and Lâmeri.—H. C.] Mr. Anderson says there are “a
  few wild people in the Siak country, very little removed in point
  of civilisation above their companions the monkeys,” but he says
  nothing of hairiness nor tails. For the earliest version of the
  tail story we must go back to Ptolemy and the Isles of the Satyrs
  in this quarter; or rather to Ctesias who tells of tailed men on an
  Island in the Indian Sea. Jordanus also has the story of the hairy
  men. Galvano heard that there were on the Island certain people
  called _Daraque Dara_ (?), which had tails like unto sheep. And
  the King of Tidore told him of another such tribe on the Isle of
  Batochina. Mr. St. John in Borneo met with a trader who had seen
  and _felt_ the tails of such a race inhabiting the north-east coast
  of that Island. The appendage was 4 inches long and very stiff; so
  the people all used perforated seats. This Borneo story has lately
  been brought forward in Calcutta, and stoutly maintained, on native
  evidence, by an English merchant. The Chinese also have their
  tailed men in the mountains above Canton. In Africa there have been
  many such stories, of some of which an account will be found in the
  _Bulletin de la Soc. de Géog._ sér. IV. tom. iii. p. 31. It was a
  story among mediæval Mahomedans that the members of the Imperial
  House of Trebizond were endowed with short tails, whilst mediæval
  Continentals had like stories about Englishmen, as Matthew Paris
  relates. Thus we find in the Romance of Cœur de Lion, Richard’s
  messengers addressed by the “Emperor of Cyprus”:—

      “Out, _Taylards_, of my palys!
       Now go, and say your _tayled_ King
       That I owe him nothing.”
                            —_Weber_, II. 83.

  The Princes of Purbandar, in the Peninsula of Guzerat, claim
  descent from the monkey-god Hanumán, and allege in justification
  a spinal elongation which gets them the name of _Púncháriah_,
  “Taylards.”

  NOTE 3.—The Camphor called _Fansúrí_ is celebrated by Arab writers
  at least as old as the 9th century, _e.g._, by the author of the
  first part of the _Relations_, by Mas’udi in the next century,
  also by Avicenna, by Abulfeda, by Kazwini, and by Abu’l Fazl,
  etc. In the second and third the name is miswritten _Ḳansúr_,
  and by the last _Ḳaisúri_, but there can be no doubt of the
  correction required. (_Reinaud_, I. 7; _Mas._ I. 338; _Liber
  Canonis_, Ven. 1544, I. 116; _Büsching_, IV. 277; _Gildem._ p.
  209; _Ain-i-Akb._ p. 78.) In Serapion we find the same camphor
  described as that of _Pansor_; and when, leaving Arab authorities
  and the earlier Middle Ages we come to Garcias, he speaks of the
  same article under the name of camphor of _Barros_. And this is the
  name—_Kápúr Bárús_—derived from the port which has been the chief
  shipping-place of Sumatran camphor for _at least_ three centuries,
  by which the native camphor is still known in Eastern trade, as
  distinguished from the _Kápúr Chíná_ or _Kápúr-Japún_, as the
  Malays term the article derived in those countries by distillation
  from the _Laurus Camphora_. The earliest western mention of camphor
  is in the same prescription by the physician Aëtius (_circa_
  A.D. 540) that contains one of the earliest mentions of musk.
  (_Supra_, I. p. 279.) The prescription ends: “and _if you have a
  supply of camphor_ add two ounces of that.” (_Aetii Medici Graeci
  Tetrabiblos_, etc., Froben, 1549, p. 910.)

  It is highly probable that _Fansúr_ and _Barús_ may be not only the
  same locality but mere variations of the same name.[2] The place is
  called in the _Shijarat Malayu_, _Pasuri_, a name which the Arabs
  certainly made into _Fansúri_ in one direction, and which might
  easily in another, by a very common kind of Oriental metathesis,
  pass into _Barúsi_. The legend in the Shijarat Malayu relates to
  the first Mahomedan mission for the conversion of Sumatra, sent by
  the Sherif of Mecca _viâ_ India. After sailing from Malabar the
  first place the party arrived at was PASURI, the people of which
  embraced Islam. They then proceeded to LAMBRI, which also accepted
  the Faith. Then they sailed on till they reached _Haru_ (see on
  my map _Aru_ on the East Coast), which did likewise. At this last
  place they enquired for SAMUDRA, which seems to have been the
  special object of their mission, and found that they had passed
  it. Accordingly they retraced their course to PERLAK, and after
  converting that place went on to SAMUDRA, where they converted
  Mara Silu the King. (See note 1, ch. x. above.) This passage is
  of extreme interest as naming _four_ out of Marco’s six kingdoms,
  and in positions quite accordant with his indications. As noticed
  by Mr. Braddell, from whose abstract I take the passage, the
  circumstance of the party having passed Samudra unwittingly is
  especially consistent with the site we have assigned to it near the
  head of the Bay of Pasei, as a glance at the map will show.

  Valentyn observes: “_Fansur_ can be nought else than the famous
  _Pantsur_, no longer known indeed by that name, but a kingdom which
  we become acquainted with through _Hamza Pantsuri_, a celebrated
  Poet, and native of this Pantsur. It lay in the north angle of
  the Island, and a little west of Achin: it formerly was rife with
  trade and population, but would have been utterly lost in oblivion
  had not Hamza Pantsuri made us again acquainted with it.” Nothing
  indeed could well be “a little west of Achin”; this is doubtless a
  slip for “a little down the west coast from Achin.” Hamza Fantsuri,
  as he is termed by Professor Veth, who also identifies Fantsur with
  Bárús, was a poet of the first half of the 17th century, who in his
  verses popularised the mystical theology of Shamsuddin Shamatrani
  (_supra_, p. 291), strongly tinged with pantheism. The works of
  both were solemnly burnt before the great mosque of Achin about
  1640. (_J. Ind. Arch._ V. 312 _seqq._; _Valentyn_, Sumatra, in Vol.
  V., p. 21; _Veth, Atchin_, Leiden, 1873, p. 38.)

  Mas’udi says that the Fansur Camphor was found most plentifully in
  years rife with storms and earthquakes. Ibn Batuta gives a jumbled
  and highly incorrect account of the product, but one circumstance
  that he mentions is possibly founded on a real superstition,
  viz., that no camphor was formed unless some animal had been
  sacrificed at the root of the tree, and the best quality only then
  when a human victim had been offered. Nicolo Conti has a similar
  statement: “The Camphor is found inside the tree, and if they do
  not sacrifice to the gods before they cut the bark, it disappears
  and is no more seen.” Beccari, in our day, mentions special
  ceremonies used by the Kayans of Borneo, before they commence the
  search. These superstitions hinge on the great uncertainty of
  finding camphor in any given tree, after the laborious process
  of cutting it down and splitting it, an uncertainty which also
  largely accounts for the high price. By far the best of the old
  accounts of the product is that quoted by Kazwini from Mahomed Ben
  Zakaria Al-Rázi: “Among the number of marvellous things in this
  Island” (_Zánij_ for Zábaj, _i.e._ Java or Sumatra) “is the Camphor
  Tree, which is of vast size, insomuch that its shade will cover a
  hundred persons and more. They bore into the highest part of the
  tree and thence flows out the camphor-water, enough to fill many
  pitchers. Then they open the tree lower down about the middle, and
  extract the camphor in lumps.” [This very account is to be found
  in Ibn Khordâdhbeh. (_De Goeje’s transl._ p. 45.)—H. C.] Compare
  this passage, which we may notice has been borrowed bodily by
  Sindbad of the Sea, with what is probably the best modern account,
  Junghuhn’s: “Among the forest trees (of Tapanuli adjoining Barus)
  the Camphor Tree (_Dryabalanops Camphora_) attracts beyond all the
  traveller’s observation, by its straight columnar and colossal
  grey trunk, and its mighty crown of foliage, rising high above the
  canopy of the forest. It exceeds in dimensions the _Rasamala_,[3]
  the loftiest tree of Java, and is probably the greatest tree of
  the Archipelago, if not of the world,[4] reaching a height of 200
  feet. One of the middling size which I had cut down measured at the
  base, where the camphor leaks out, 7½ Paris feet in diameter (about
  8 feet English); its trunk rose to 100 feet, with an upper diameter
  of 5 feet, before dividing, and the height of the whole tree to the
  crown was 150 feet. The precious consolidated camphor is found in
  small quantities, ¼ lb. to 1 lb. in a single tree, in fissure-like
  hollows in the stem. Yet many are cut down in vain, or split up
  the side without finding camphor. The camphor oil is prepared by
  the natives by bruising and boiling the twigs.” The oil, however,
  appears also to be found in the tree, as Crawford and Collingwood
  mention, corroborating the ancient Arab.

  It is well known that the Chinese attach an extravagantly superior
  value to the Malay camphor, and probably its value in Marco’s day
  was higher than it is now, but still its estimate as worth its
  weight in gold looks like hyperbole. Forrest, a century ago, says
  Barus Camphor was in the Chinese market worth nearly its weight in
  _silver_, and this is true still. The price is commonly estimated
  at 100 times that of the Chinese camphor. The whole quantity
  exported from the Barus territory goes to China. De Vriese reckons
  the average annual export from Sumatra between 1839 and 1844 at
  less than 400 kilogrammes. The following table shows the wholesale
  rates in the Chinese market as given by Rondot in 1848:—

  The Chinese call the Sumatran (or Borneo) Camphor _Ping-pien_
  “Icicle flakes,” and _Lung-nau_ “Dragon’s Brains.” [Regarding Baros
  Camphor, Mr. Groeneveldt writes (_Notes_, p. 142): “This substance
  is generally called _dragon’s brain perfume_, or _icicles_. The
  former name has probably been invented by the first dealers in the
  article, who wanted to impress their countrymen with a great idea
  of its value and rarity. In the trade three different qualities
  are distinguished: the first is called _prune-blossoms_, being the
  larger pieces; the second is _rice-camphor_, so called because the
  particles are not larger than a rice-kernel, and the last quality
  is _golden dregs_, in the shape of powder. These names are still
  now used by the Chinese traders on the west coast of Sumatra. The
  _Pên-ts’au Kang-mu_ further informs us that the Camphor Baros is
  found in the trunk of a tree in a solid shape, whilst from the
  roots an oil is obtained called _Po-lut_ (Pa-lut) _incense_, or
  _Polut balm_. The name of Polut is said to be derived from the
  country where it is found (Baros.)”—H. C.] It is just to remark,
  however, that in the _Aín Akbari_ we find the price of the Sumatran
  Camphor, known to the Hindus as _Bhím Seni_, varying from 3 rupees
  as high as 2 mohurs (or 20 rupees) for a rupee’s weight, which
  latter price would be _twice_ the weight in gold. Abu’l Fazl says
  the worst camphor went by the name of _Bálús_. I should suspect
  some mistake, as we know from Garcias that the fine camphor was
  already known as _Barus_. (_Ain-i-Akb._ 75–79.)

  NOTE 4.—An interesting notice of the Sago-tree, of which Odoric
  also gives an account. Ramusio is, however, here fuller and more
  accurate: “Removing the first bark, which is but thin, you come
  on the wood of the tree which forms a thickness all round of some
  three fingers, but all inside this is a pith of flour, like that
  of the _Carvolo_ (?). The trees are so big that it will take two
  men to span them. They put this flour into tubs of water, and beat
  it up with a stick, and then the bran and other impurities come to
  the top, whilst the pure flour sinks to the bottom. The water is
  then thrown away, and the cleaned flour that remains is taken and
  made into _pasta_ in strips and other forms. These Messer Marco
  often partook of, and brought some with him to Venice. It resembles
  barley bread and tastes much the same. The wood of this tree is
  like iron, for if thrown into the water it goes straight to the
  bottom. It can be split straight from end to end like a cane. When
  the flour has been removed the wood remains, as has been said,
  three inches thick. Of this the people make short lances, not long
  ones, because they are so heavy that no one could carry or handle
  them if long. One end is sharpened and charred in the fire, and
  when thus prepared they will pierce any armour, and much better
  than iron would do.” Marsden points out that this heavy lance-wood
  is not that of the true Sago-palm, but of the _Nibong_ or Caryota
  urens; which does indeed give some amount of sago.

  [“When sago is to be made, a full-grown tree is selected just
  before it is going to flower. It is cut down close to the ground,
  the leaves and leaf-stalks cleared away, and a broad strip of the
  bark taken off the upper side of the trunk. This exposes the pithy
  matter, which is of a rusty colour near the bottom of the tree,
  but higher up pure white, about as hard as a dry apple, but with
  woody fibres running through it about a quarter of an inch apart.
  This pith is cut or broken down into a coarse powder, by means of
  a tool constructed for the purpose.... Water is poured on the mass
  of pith, which is kneaded and pressed against the strainer till the
  starch is all dissolved and has passed through, when the fibrous
  refuse is thrown away, and a fresh basketful put in its place.
  The water charged with sago starch passes on to a trough, with a
  depression in the centre, where the sediment is deposited, the
  surplus water trickling off by a shallow outlet. When the trough is
  nearly full, the mass of starch, which has a slight reddish tinge,
  is made into cylinders of about thirty pounds’ weight, and neatly
  covered with sago leaves, and in this state is sold as raw sago.
  Boiled with water this forms a thick glutinous mass, with a rather
  astringent taste, and is eaten with salt, limes, and chilies.
  Sago-bread is made in large quantities, by baking it into cakes
  in a small clay oven containing six or eight slits side by side,
  each about three-quarters of an inch wide, and six or eight inches
  square. The raw sago is broken up, dried in the sun, powdered, and
  finely sifted. The oven is heated over a clear fire of embers,
  and is lightly filled with the sago powder. The openings are then
  covered with a flat piece of sago bark, and in about five minutes
  the cakes are turned out sufficiently baked. The hot cakes are
  very nice with butter, and when made with the addition of a little
  sugar and grated cocoa-nut are quite a delicacy. They are soft, and
  something like corn-flour cakes, but have a slight characteristic
  flavour which is lost in the refined sago we use in this country.
  When not wanted for immediate use, they are dried for several days
  in the sun, and tied up in bundles of twenty. They will then keep
  for years; they are very hard, and very rough and dry....” (_A. R.
  Wallace’s Malay Archipelago_, 1869, II. pp. 118–121.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 5.—In quitting the subject of these Sumatran Kingdoms it may
  appear to some readers that our explanations compress them too
  much, especially as Polo seems to allow only two kingdoms for the
  rest of the Island. In this he was doubtless wrong, and we may the
  less scruple to say so as he had _not_ visited that other portion
  of the Island. We may note that in the space to which we assign
  the _six_ kingdoms which Polo visited, De Barros assigns _twelve_,
  viz.: Bara (corresponding generally to _Ferlec_), Pacem (_Basma_),
  Pirada, Lide, Pedir, Biar, Achin, _Lambri_, Daya, Mancopa,
  Quinchel, Barros (_Fansur_). (_Dec._ III. v. 1.)

  [Regarding these Sumatrian kingdoms, Mr. Thomson (_Proc. R. G. S._
  XX. p. 223) writes that Malaiur “is no other than Singapore ...
  the ancient capital of the Malays or Malaiurs of old voyagers,
  existent in the times of Marco Polo [who] mentions no kingdom or
  city in Java Minor till he arrives at the kingdom of Felech or
  Perlak. And this is just as might be expected, as the channel in
  the Straits of Malacca leads on the north-eastern side out of
  sight of Sumatra; and the course, after clearing the shoals near
  Selangore, being direct towards Diamond Point, near which ...
  the tower of Perlak is situated. Thus we see that the Venetian
  traveller describes the first city or kingdom in the great island
  that he arrived at.... [After Basman and Samara] Polo mentions
  Dragoian ... from the context, and following Marco Polo’s course,
  we would place it west from his last city or Kingdom Samara;
  and we make no doubt, if the name is not much corrupted, it may
  yet be identified in one of the villages of the coast at this
  present time.... By the Malay annalist, Lambri was west of Samara;
  consecutively it was also westerly from Samara by Marco Polo’s
  enumeration. Fanfur ... is the last kingdom named by Marco Polo
  [coming from the east], and the first by the Malay annalist [coming
  from the west]; and as it is known to modern geographers, this
  corroboration doubly settles the identity and position of all.
  Thus all the six cities or kingdoms mentioned by Marco Polo were
  situated on the north coast of Sumatra, now commonly known as
  the Pedir coast.” I have given the conclusion arrived at by Mr.
  J. T. Thomson in his paper, _Marco Polo’s Six Kingdoms or Cities
  in Java Minor, identified in translations from the ancient Malay
  Annals_, which appeared in the _Proc. R. G. S._ XX. pp. 215–224,
  after the second edition of this Book was published and Sir H. Yule
  added the following note (_Proc._, _l.c._, p. 224): “Mr. Thomson,
  as he mentions, has not seen my edition of _Marco Polo_, nor,
  apparently, a paper on the subject of these kingdoms by the late
  Mr. J. R. Logan, in his _Journal of the Indian Archipelago_, to
  which reference is made in the notes to _Marco Polo_. In the said
  paper and notes the quotations and conclusions of Mr. Thomson have
  been anticipated; and _Fansúr_ also, which he leaves undetermined,
  identified.”—H. C.]

                             CHAPTER XII.

                  CONCERNING THE ISLAND OF NECUVERAN.


When you leave the Island of Java (the less) and the kingdom of Lambri,
you sail north about 150 miles, and then you come to two Islands, one
of which is called NECUVERAN. In this Island they have no king nor
chief, but live like beasts. And I tell you they go all naked, both men
and women, and do not use the slightest covering of any kind. They are
Idolaters. Their woods are all of noble and valuable kinds of trees;
such as Red Sanders and Indian-nut and Cloves and Brazil and sundry
other good spices.{1}

There is nothing else worth relating; so we will go on, and I will tell
you of an Island called Angamanain.


  NOTE 1.—The end of the last chapter and the commencement of this
  I have taken from the G. Text. There has been some confusion in
  the notes of the original dictation which that represents, and
  corrections have made it worse. Thus Pauthier’s text runs: “I will
  tell you of two small Islands, one called Gauenispola and the other
  Necouran,” and then: “You sail north about 150 miles and find two
  Islands, one called Necouran and the other Gauenispola.” Ramusio
  does not mention Gauenispola, but says in the former passage: “I
  will tell you of a small Island called Nocueran”—and then: “You
  find two islands, one called Nocueran and the other Angaman.”

  Knowing the position of Gauenispola there is no difficulty
  in seeing how the passage should be explained. Something has
  interrupted the dictation after the last chapter. Polo asks
  Rusticiano, “Where were we?” “Leaving the Great Island.” Polo
  forgets the “very small Island called Gauenispola,” and passes to
  the north, where he has to tell us of two islands, “one called
  Necuveran and the other Angamanain.” So, I do not doubt, the
  passage should run.

  Let us observe that his point of departure in sailing north to the
  Nicobar Islands was the _Kingdom of Lambri_. This seems to indicate
  that Lambri included Achin Head or came very near it, an indication
  which we shall presently see confirmed.

  As regards Gauenispola, of which he promised to tell us and forgot
  his promise, its name has disappeared from our modern maps, but
  it is easily traced in the maps of the 16th and 17th centuries,
  and in the books of navigators of that time. The latest in which
  I have observed it is the _Neptune Oriental_, Paris 1775, which
  calls it _Pulo Gommes_. The name is there applied to a small
  island off Achin Head, outside of which lie the somewhat larger
  Islands of Pulo Nankai (or Nási) and Pulo Bras, whilst Pulo Wai
  lies further east.[1] I imagine, however, that the name was by the
  older navigators applied to the larger Island of Pulo Bras, or to
  the whole group. Thus Alexander Hamilton, who calls it _Gomus_ and
  _Pulo Gomuis_, says that “from the Island of Gomus and Pulo Wey
  ... the southernmost of the Nicobars may be seen.” Dampier most
  precisely applies the name of Pulo Gomez to the larger island which
  modern charts call Pulo Bras. So also Beaulieu couples the islands
  of “_Gomispoda_ and Pulo Way” in front of the roadstead of Achin.
  De Barros mentions that Gaspar d’Acosta was lost on the Island
  of _Gomispola_. Linschoten, describing the course from Cochin to
  Malacca, says: “You take your course towards the small Isles of
  GOMESPOLA, which are in 6°, near the corner of Achin in the Island
  of Sumatra.” And the Turkish author of the _Mohit_, in speaking of
  the same navigation, says: “If you wish to reach Malacca, guard
  against seeing JÁMISFULAH (جامس فله), because the mountains of
  LÁMRI advance into the sea, and the flood is there very strong.”
  The editor has misunderstood the geography of this passage, which
  evidently means “Don’t go near enough to Achin Head to see even
  the islands in front of it.” And here we see again that Lambri is
  made to extend to Achin Head. The passage is illustrated by the
  report of the first English Voyage to the Indies. Their course was
  for the Nicobars, but “by the Master’s fault in not duly observing
  the South Star, they fell to the southward of them, _within sight
  of the Islands of Gomes Polo_.” (_Nept. Orient._ Charts 38 and 39,

  The two islands (or rather groups of islands) _Necuveran_ and
  _Angamanain_ are the Nicobar and Andaman groups. A nearer trace of
  the form Necuveran, or _Necouran_ as it stands in some MSS., is
  perhaps preserved in _Nancouri_, the existing name of one of the
  islands. They are perhaps the _Nalo-kilo-chéu_ (_Narikela-dvipa_)
  or Coco-nut Islands of which Hiuen Tsang speaks as existing some
  thousand _li_ to the south of Ceylon. The men, he had heard,
  were but 3 feet high, and had the beaks of birds. They had no
  cultivation and lived on coco-nuts. The islands are also believed
  to be the _Lanja bálús_ or _Lankha bálús_ of the old Arab
  navigators: “These Islands support a numerous population. Both men
  and women go naked, only the women wear a girdle of the leaves
  of trees. When a ship passes near, the men come out in boats of
  various sizes and barter ambergris and coco-nuts for iron,” a
  description which has applied accurately for many centuries. [Ibn
  Khordâdhbeh says (_De Goeje’s transl._, p. 45) that the inhabitants
  of Nicobar (Alankabâlous), an island situated at ten or fifteen
  days from Serendib, are naked; they live on bananas, fresh fish,
  and coco-nuts; the precious metal is iron in their country; they
  frequent foreign merchants.—H. C.] Rashiduddin writes of them
  nearly in the same terms under the name of _Lákváram_, but read
  NÁKAVÁRAM opposite LAMURI. Odoric also has a chapter on the island
  of _Nicoveran_, but it is one full of fable. (_H. Tsang_, III. 114
  and 517; _Relations_, p. 8; _Elliot_, I. p. 71; _Cathay_, p. 97.)

  [Mr. G. Phillips writes (_J. R. A. S._, July 1895, p. 529) that the
  name Tsui-lan given to the Nicobars by the Chinese is, he has but
  little doubt, “a corruption of Nocueran, the name given by Marco
  Polo to the group. The characters Tsui-lan are pronounced Ch’ui-lan
  in Amoy, out of which it is easy to make Cueran. The Chinese
  omitted the initial syllable and called them the Cueran Islands,
  while Marco Polo called them the Nocueran Islands.”—H. C.]

  [The Nicobar Islands “are generally known by the Chinese under the
  name of _Râkchas_ or Demons who devour men, from the belief that
  their inhabitants were anthropophagi. In A.D. 607, the Emperor of
  China, Yang-ti, had sent an envoy to Siam, who also reached the
  country of the Râkchas. According to _Tu-yen’s T’ung-tien_, the
  Nicobars lie east [west] of Poli. Its inhabitants are very ugly,
  having red hair, black bodies, teeth like beasts, and claws like
  hawks. Sometimes they traded with _Lin-yih_ (Champa), but then at
  night; in day-time they covered their faces.” (_G. Schlegel, Geog.
  Notes_, I. pp. 1–2.)—H. C.]

  Mr. Phillips, from his anonymous Chinese author, gives a quaint
  legend as to the nakedness of these islanders. Sakya Muni, having
  arrived from Ceylon, stopped at the islands to bathe. Whilst he
  was in the water the natives stole his clothes, upon which the
  Buddha cursed them; and they have never since been able to wear any
  clothing without suffering for it.

  [Professor Schlegel gives the same legend (_Geog. Notes_, I. p.
  8) with reference to the _Andaman_ Islands from the _Sing-ch’a
  Shêng-lan_, published in 1436 by Fei-sin; Mr. Phillips seems to
  have made a confusion between the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
  (_Doolittle’s Vocab._ II. p. 556; cf. _Schlegel_, _l.c._ p.
  11.)—H. C.]

  The chief part of the population is believed to be of race akin to
  the Malay, but they seem to be of more than one race, and there
  is great variety in dialect. There have long been reports of a
  black tribe with woolly hair in the unknown interior of the Great
  Nicobar, and my friend Colonel H. Man, when Superintendent of our
  Andaman Settlements, received spontaneous corroboration of this
  from natives of the former island, who were on a visit to Port
  Blair. Since this has been in type I have seen in the _F. of India_
  (28th July, 1874) notice of a valuable work by F. A. de Roepstorff
  on the dialects and manners of the Nicobarians. This notice speaks
  of an aboriginal race called _Shob’aengs_, “purely Mongolian,” but
  does not mention negritoes. The natives do not now go quite naked;
  the men wear a narrow cloth; and the women a grass girdle. They are
  very skilful in management of their canoes. Some years since there
  were frightful disclosures regarding the massacre of the crews of
  vessels touching at these islands, and this has led eventually to
  their occupation by the Indian Government. Trinkat and Nancouri
  are the islands which were guilty. A woman of Trinkat who could
  speak Malay was examined by Colonel Man, and she acknowledged
  having seen nineteen vessels scuttled, after their cargoes had been
  plundered and their crews massacred. “The natives who were captured
  at Trinkat,” says Colonel Man in another letter, “were a most
  savage-looking set, with remarkably long arms, and very projecting
  eye-teeth.”

  The islands have always been famous for the quality and abundance
  of their “Indian Nuts,” _i.e._ cocos. The tree of next importance
  to the natives is a kind of Pandanus, from the cooked fruit of
  which they express an edible substance called Melori, of which
  you may read in Dampier; they have the betel and areca; and they
  grow yams, but only for barter. As regards the other vegetation,
  mentioned by Polo, I will quote, what Colonel Man writes to me from
  the Andamans, which probably is in great measure applicable to the
  Nicobars also! “Our woods are very fine, and doubtless resemble
  those of the Nicobars. Sapan wood (_i.e._ Polo’s _Brazil_) is in
  abundance; coco-nuts, so numerous in the Nicobars, and to the north
  in the Cocos, are not found naturally with us, though they grow
  admirably when cultivated. There is said to be sandal-wood in our
  forests, and camphor, but I have not yet come across them. I do not
  believe in _cloves_, but we have lots of the wild nutmeg.”[2] The
  last, and cardamoms, are mentioned in the _Voyage of the Novara_,
  vol. ii., in which will be found a detail of the various European
  attempts to colonise the Nicobar Islands with other particulars.

  Notes_, XVI., _The Old States in the Island of Sumatra._—H. C.]


----------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] It was a mistake to suppose the name had disappeared, for it is
    applied, in the form _Pulo Gaimr_, to the small island above
    indicated, in Colonel Versteeg’s map to Veth’s _Atchin_ (1873).
    In a map chiefly borrowed from that, in _Ocean Highways_, August,
    1873, I have ventured to restore the name as _Pulo Gomus_. The name
    is perhaps (Mal.) _Gamás_, “hard, rough.”

[2] Kurz’s _Vegetation of the Andaman Islands_ gives four _myristicae_
    (nutmegs); but no sandal-wood nor camphor-laurel. Nor do I find
    sappan-wood, though there is another Caesalpinia (_C. Nuga_).




                             CHAPTER XIII.

                 CONCERNING THE ISLAND OF ANGAMANAIN.


Angamanain is a very large Island. The people are without a king and
are Idolaters, and no better than wild beasts. And I assure you all
the men of this Island of Angamanain have heads like dogs, and teeth
and eyes likewise; in fact, in the face they are all just like big
mastiff dogs! They have a quantity of spices; but they are a most cruel
generation, and eat everybody that they can catch, if not of their
own race.{1} They live on flesh and rice and milk, and have fruits
different from any of ours.

Now that I have told you about this race of people, as indeed it was
highly proper to do in this our book, I will go on to tell you about an
Island called Seilan, as you shall hear.


  NOTE 1.—Here Marco speaks of the remarkable population of
  the Andaman Islands—Oriental negroes in the lowest state of
  barbarism—who have remained in their isolated and degraded
  condition, so near the shores of great civilised countries, for so
  many ages. “Rice and milk” they have not, and their fruits are only
  wild ones.

  [From the _Sing-ch’a Shêng-lan_ quoted by Professor Schlegel
  (_Geog. Notes_, I. p. 8) we learn that these islanders have neither
  “rice or corn, but only descend into the sea and catch fish and
  shrimps in their nets; they also plant Banians and Cocoa-trees for
  their food.”—H. C.]

  I imagine our traveller’s form _Angamanain_ to be an Arabic
  (oblique) dual—“The two ANDAMANS,” viz. The Great and The Little,
  the former being in truth a chain of three islands, but so close
  and nearly continuous as to form apparently one, and to be named as
  such.

  [Illustration:

    The Borús. (From a Manuscript.)]

  [Professor Schlegel writes (_Geog. Notes._ I. p. 12): “This
  etymology is to be rejected because the old Chinese transcription
  gives _So_—(or _Sun_) _damân_.... The _Pien-i-tien_ (ch. 107, I.
  fol. 30) gives a description of Andaman, here called _An-to-man
  kwoh_, quoted from the _San-tsai Tu-hwui_.”—H. C.]

  The origin of the name seems to be unknown. The only person to my
  knowledge who has given a meaning to it is Nicolo Conti, who says
  it means “Island of Gold”; probably a mere sailor’s yarn. The name,
  however, is very old, and may perhaps be traced in Ptolemy; for he
  names an island of cannibals called that of _Good Fortune_, Ἀγαθοῦ
  δαίμονος. It seems probable enough that this was Ἀγδαιμόνος Νῆσος,
  or the like, “The Angdaman Island,” misunderstood. His next group
  of Islands is the _Barussae_, which seems again to be the Lankha
  _Bálús_ of the oldest Arab navigators, since these are certainly
  the Nicobars. [The name first appears distinctly in the Arab
  narratives of the 9th century. (_Yule, Hobson-Jobson_.)]

  The description of the natives of the Andaman Islands in the
  early Arab _Relations_ has been often quoted, but it is too like
  our traveller’s account to be omitted: “The inhabitants of these
  islands eat men alive. They are black with woolly hair, and in
  their eyes and countenance there is something quite frightful....
  They go naked, and have no boats. If they had they would devour
  all who passed near them. Sometimes ships that are wind-bound, and
  have exhausted their provision of water, touch here and apply to
  the natives for it; in such cases the crew sometimes fall into the
  hands of the latter, and most of them are massacred” (p. 9).

  The traditional charge of cannibalism against these people used
  to be very persistent, though it is generally rejected since our
  settlement upon the group in 1858. Mr. Logan supposes the report
  was cherished by those who frequented the islands for edible birds’
  nests, in order to keep the monopoly. Of their murdering the crews
  of wrecked vessels, like their Nicobar neighbours, I believe there
  is no doubt; and it has happened in our own day. Cesare Federici,
  in Ramusio, speaks of the terrible fate of crews wrecked on the
  Andamans; all such were killed and eaten by the natives, who
  refused all intercourse with strangers. A. Hamilton mentions a
  friend of his who was wrecked on the islands; nothing more was ever
  heard of the ship’s company, “which gave ground to conjecture that
  they were all devoured by those savage cannibals.”

  [Illustration: The Cynocephali. (From the _Livre des Merveilles_.)]

  They do not, in modern times, I believe, in their canoes, quit
  their own immediate coast, but Hamilton says they used, in his
  time, to come on forays to the Nicobar Islands; and a paper in the
  _Asiatic Researches_ mentions a tradition to the same effect as
  existing on the Car Nicobar. They have retained all the aversion to
  intercourse anciently ascribed to them, and they still go naked as
  of old, the utmost exception being a leaf-apron worn by the women
  near the British Settlement.

  The Dog-head feature is at least as old as Ctesias. The story
  originated, I imagine, in the disgust with which “allophylian”
  types of countenance are regarded, kindred to the feeling which
  makes the Hindus and other eastern nations represent the aborigines
  whom they superseded as demons. The Cubans described the Caribs
  to Columbus as man-eaters with dogs’ muzzles; and the old Danes
  had tales of Cynocephali in Finland. A curious passage from the
  Arab geographer Ibn Said pays an ambiguous compliment to the
  forefathers of Moltke and Von Roon: “The _Borús_ (Prussians) are
  a miserable people, and still more savage than the Russians....
  One reads in some books _that the_ Borús _have dogs’ faces; it is
  a way of saying that they are very brave_.” Ibn Batuta describes an
  Indo-Chinese tribe on the coast of Arakan or Pegu as having dogs’
  mouths, but says the _women_ were beautiful. Friar Jordanus had
  heard the same of the dog-headed islanders. And one odd form of
  the story, found, strange to say, both in China and diffused over
  Ethiopia, represents the males as _actual_ dogs whilst the females
  are women. Oddly, too, Père Barbe tells us that a tradition of the
  Nicobar people themselves represent them as of canine descent, but
  on the female side! The like tale in early Portuguese days was told
  of the Peguans, viz. that they sprang from a dog and a Chinese
  woman. It is mentioned by Camoens (X. 122). Note, however, that in
  Colonel Man’s notice of the wilder part of the Nicobar people the
  projecting canine teeth are spoken of.

  Abraham Roger tells us that the Coromandel Brahmans used to say
  that the _Rákshasas_ or Demons had their abode “on the Island
  of Andaman lying on the route from Pulicat to Pegu,” and also
  that they were man-eaters. This would be very curious if it were
  a genuine old Brahmanical _Saga_; but I fear it may have been
  gathered from the Arab seamen. Still it is remarkable that a
  strange weird-looking island, a steep and regular volcanic cone,
  which rises covered with forest to a height of 2150 feet, straight
  out of the deep sea to the eastward of the Andaman group, bears the
  name _Narkandam_, in which one cannot but recognise नरक, _Narak_,
  “Hell”; perhaps _Naraka-kuṇḍam_, “a pit of hell.” Can it be that
  in old times, but still contemporary with Hindu navigation, this
  volcano was active, and that some Brahman St. Brandon recognised in
  it the mouth of Hell, congenial to the Rakshasas of the adjacent
  group?

                   CONCERNING THE ISLAND OF SEILAN.


When you leave the Island of Angamanain and sail about a thousand
miles in a direction a little south of west, you come to the Island of
SEILAN,{1} which is in good sooth the best Island of its size in the
world. You must know that it has a compass of 2400 miles, but in old
times it was greater still, for it then had a circuit of about 3600
miles, as you find in the charts of the mariners of those seas. But
the north wind there blows with such strength that it has caused the
sea to submerge a large part of the Island; and that is the reason why
it is not so big now as it used to be. For you must know that, on the
side where the north wind strikes, the Island is very low and flat,
insomuch that in approaching on board ship from the high seas you do
not see the land till you are right upon it.{2} Now I will tell you all
about this Island.

[Illustration: MAP to Illustrate POLO’S Chapters on India.

They have a king there whom they call SENDEMAIN, and are tributary to
nobody.{3} The people are Idolaters, and go quite naked except that
they cover the middle. They have no wheat, but have rice, and sesamum
of which they make their oil. They live on flesh and milk, and have
tree-wine such as I have told you of. And they have brazil-wood, much
the best in the world.{4}

Now I will quit these particulars, and tell you of the most precious
article that exists in the world. You must know that rubies are found
in this Island and in no other country in the world but this. They find
there also sapphires and topazes and amethysts, and many other stones
of price. And the King of this Island possesses a ruby which is the
finest and biggest in the world; I will tell you what it is like. It
is about a palm in length, and as thick as a man’s arm; to look at, it
is the most resplendent object upon earth; it is quite free from flaw
and as red as fire. Its value is so great that a price for it in money
could hardly be named at all. You must know that the Great Kaan sent an
embassy and begged the King as a favour greatly desired by him to sell
him this ruby, offering to give for it the ransom of a city, or in fact
what the King would. But the King replied that on no account whatever
would he sell it, for it had come to him from his ancestors.{5}

The people of Seilan are no soldiers, but poor cowardly creatures. And
when they have need of soldiers they get Saracen troops from foreign
parts.

  seqq._) the Star Chart used by Chinese Navigators on their return
  voyage from Ceylon to _Su-men-tâ-la_.—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—Valentyn appears to be repeating a native tradition when he
  says: “In old times the island had, as they loosely say, a good 400
  miles (_i.e._ Dutch, say 1600 miles) of compass, but at the north
  end the sea has from time to time carried away a large part of it.”
  (_Ceylon_, in vol. v., p. 18.) Curious particulars touching the
  exaggerated ideas of the ancients, inherited by the Arabs, as to
  the dimensions of Ceylon, will be found in _Tennent’s Ceylon_, ch.
  i. The Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang has the same tale. According to
  him, the circuit was 7000 _li_, or 1400 miles. We see from Marco’s
  curious notice of the old charts (G. T. “_selonc qe se treuve en la
  mapemondi des mariner de cel mer_”) that travellers had begun to
  find that the dimensions _were_ exaggerated. The real circuit is
  under 700 miles!

  On the ground that all the derivations of the name SAILAN or CEYLON
  from the old _Sinhala_, _Serendib_, and what not, seem forced,
  Van der Tuuk has suggested that the name may have been originally
  Javanese, being formed (he says) according to the rules of that
  language from _Sela_, “a precious stone,” so that _Pulo Selan_
  would be the “Island of Gems.” [Professor Schlegel says (_Geog.
  Notes_, I. p. 19, note) that “it seems better to think of the
  Sanskrit _šila_, ‘a stone or rock,’ or _šaila_, ‘a mountain,’ which
  agree with the Chinese interpretation.”—H. C.] The Island was
  really called anciently _Ratnadvīpa_, “the Island of Gems” (_Mém.
  de H. T._, II. 125, and _Harivansa_, I. 403); and it is termed by
  an Arab Historian of the 9th century _Jazírat al Yáḳút_, “The Isle
  of Rubies.” [The (Chinese) characters _ya-ku-pao-shih_ are in some
  accounts of Ceylon used to express _Yáḳút_. (_Ma-Huan, transl.
  by Phillips_, p. 213.)—H. C.] As a matter of fact, we derive
  originally from the Malays nearly all the forms we have adopted
  for names of countries reached by sea to the _east_ of the Bay of
  Bengal, _e.g._ _Awa_, _Barma_, _Paigu_, _Siyam_, _China_, _Japún_,
  _Kochi_ (Cochin China), _Champa_, _Kamboja_, _Malúka_ (properly
  a place in the Island of Ceram), _Súlúk_, _Burnei_, _Tanasari_,
  _Martavan_, etc. That accidents in the history of marine affairs
  in those seas should have led to the adoption of the Malay and
  Javanese names in the case of Ceylon also is at least conceivable.
  But Dr. Caldwell has pointed out to me that the Páli form of
  Sinhala was _Sihalan_, and that this must have been colloquially
  shortened to _Sîlan_, for it appears in old Tamul inscriptions as
  _Ilam_.[1] Hence there is nothing really strained in the derivation
  of _Sailán_ from Sinhala. Tennent (_Ceylon_, I. 549) and Crawford
  (_Malay Dict._ p. 171) ascribe the name Selan, Zeilan, to the
  Portuguese, but this is quite unfounded, as our author sufficiently
  testifies. The name _Sailán_ also occurs in Rashiduddin, in Hayton,
  and in Jordanus (see next note). (See _Van der Tuuk_, work quoted
  above (p. 287), p. 118; _J. As._ sér. IV., tom. viii. 145; _J. Ind.
  Arch._ IV. 187; _Elliot_, I. 70.) [_Sinhala_ or _Sihala_, “lions’
  abode,” with the addition of “Island,” _Sihala-dvīpa_, comes down
  to us in Cosmas Σιελεδίβα (_Hobson-Jobson_).]

  NOTE 3.—The native king at this time was Pandita Prakrama Bahu
  III., who reigned from 1267 to 1301 at Dambadenia, about 40 miles
  north-north-east of Columbo. But the Tamuls of the continent had
  recently been in possession of the whole northern half of the
  island. The Singhalese Chronicle represents Prakrama to have
  recovered it from them, but they are so soon again found in full
  force that the completeness of this recovery may be doubted. There
  were also two invasions of Malays (_Javaku_) during this reign,
  under the lead of a chief called _Chandra Banu_. On the second
  occasion this invader was joined by a large Tamul reinforcement.
  Sir E. Tennent suggests that this Chandra Banu may be Polo’s
  _Sende-main_ or _Sendernaz_, as Ramusio has it. Or he may have been
  the Tamul chief in the north; the first part of the name may have
  been either _Chandra_ or _Sundara_.

  NOTE 4.—Kazwini names the brazil, or sapan-wood of Ceylon. Ibn
  Batuta speaks of its abundance (IV. 166); and Ribeyro does the like
  (ed. of Columbo, 1847, p. 16); see also _Ritter_, VI. 39, 122; and
  _Trans. R. A. S._ I. 539.

  Sir E. Tennent has observed that Ibn Batuta is the first to speak
  of the Ceylon cinnamon. It is, however, mentioned by Kazwini
  (_circa_ A.D. 1275), and in a letter written from Mabar by John of
  Montecorvino about the very time that Marco was in these seas. (See
  _Ethé’s Kazwini_, 229, and _Cathay_, 213.)

  [Mr. G. Phillips, in the _Jour. China B. R. A. Soc._, XX. 1885,
  pp. 209–226; XXI. 1886, pp. 30–42, has given, under the title of
  _The Seaports of India and Ceylon_, a translation of some parts
  of the _Ying-yai-shĕng-lan_, a work of a Chinese Mahomedan,
  Ma-Huan, who was attached to the suite of Chêng-Ho, an envoy of
  the Emperor Yong-Lo (A.D. 1403–1425) to foreign countries. Mr.
  Phillips’s translation is a continuation of the _Notes_ of Mr. W.
  P. Groeneveldt, who leaves us at Lambri, on the coast of Sumatra.
  Ma-Huan takes us to the _Ts’ui-lan_ Islands (Nicobars) and to
  _Hsi-lan-kuo_ (Ceylon), whose “people,” he says (p. 214), “are
  abundantly supplied with all the necessaries of life. They go about
  naked, except that they wear a green handkerchief round their
  loins, fastened with a waist-band. Their bodies are clean-shaven,
  and only the hair of their heads is left.... They take no meal
  without butter and milk, if they have none and wish to eat, they do
  so unobserved and in private. The betel-nut is never out of their
  mouths. They have no wheat, but have rice, sesamum, and peas. The
  cocoa-nut, which they have in abundance, supplies them with oil,
  wine, sugar, and food.” Ma-Huan arrived at Ceylon at Pieh-lo-li, on
  the 6th of the 11th moon (seventh year, Süan Têh, end of 1432). Cf.

  Odoric and the Adjaîb do not mention cinnamon among the products
  of Ceylon; this omission was one of the arguments of Dr. Schumann
  (_Ergänz._ No. 73 zu _Petermann’s Mitt._, 1883, p. 46) against the
  authenticity of the Adjaîb. These arguments have been refuted in
  the _Livre des Merveilles de l’Inde_, p. 265 _seqq._

  Nicolo Conti, speaking of the “very noble island called Zeilan,”
  says (p. 7): “Here also cinnamon grows in great abundance. It is a
  tree which very much resembles our thick willows, excepting that
  the branches do not grow upwards, but are spread out horizontally:
  the leaves are very like those of the laurel, but are somewhat
  larger. The bark of the branches is the thinnest and best, that
  of the trunk of the tree is thicker and inferior in flavour. The
  fruit resembles the berries of the laurel; an odoriferous oil is
  extracted from it adapted for ointments, which are much used by
  the Indians. When the bark is stripped off, the wood is used for
  fuel.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 5.—There seems to have been always afloat among Indian
  travellers, at least from the time of Cosmas (6th century), some
  wonderful story about the ruby or rubies of the king of Ceylon.
  With Cosmas, and with the Chinese Hiuen Tsang, in the following
  century, this precious object is fixed on the top of a pagoda,
  “a hyacinth, they say, of great size and brilliant ruddy colour,
  as big as a great pine-cone; and when ’tis seen from a distance
  flashing, especially if the sun’s rays strike upon it, ’tis a
  glorious and incomparable spectacle.” Our author’s contemporary,
  Hayton, had heard of the great ruby: “The king of that Island of
  Celan hath the largest and finest ruby in existence. When his
  coronation takes place this ruby is placed in his hand, and he goes
  round the city on horseback holding it in his hand, and thenceforth
  all recognise and obey him as their king.” Odoric too speaks of
  the great ruby and the Kaan’s endeavours to get it, though by some
  error the circumstance is referred to Nicoveran instead of Ceylon.
  Ibn Batuta saw in the possession of Arya Chakravarti, a Tamul chief
  ruling at Patlam, a ruby bowl as big as the palm of one’s hand.
  Friar Jordanus speaks of two great rubies belonging to the king of
  SYLEN, each so large that when grasped in the hand it projected
  a finger’s breadth at either side. The fame, at least, of these
  survived to the 16th century, for Andrea Corsali (1515) says: “They
  tell that the king of this island possesses two rubies of colour so
  brilliant and vivid that they look like a flame of fire.”

  Sir E. Tennent, on this subject, quotes from a Chinese work a
  statement that early in the 14th century the Emperor sent an
  officer to Ceylon to purchase a carbuncle of unusual lustre. This
  was fitted as a ball to the Emperor’s cap; it was upwards of an
  ounce in weight and cost 100,000 strings of cash. Every time a
  grand levee was held at night the red lustre filled the palace, and
  hence it was designated “The Red Palace-Illuminator.” (_I. B._ IV.
  174–175; _Cathay_, p. clxxvii.; _Hayton_, ch. vi.; _Jord._ p. 30;
  _Ramus._ I. 180; _Ceylon_, I. 568).

  [“This mountain [Adam’s Peak] abounds with rubies of all kinds and
  other precious stones. These gems are being continually washed
  out of the ground by heavy rains, and are sought for and found in
  the sand carried down the hill by the torrents. It is currently
  reported among the people, that these precious stones are the
  congealed tears of Buddha.” (_Ma-Huan, transl. by Phillips_, p.
  213.)

  In the Chinese work _Cho keng lu_, containing notes on different
  matters referring to the time of the Mongol Dynasty, in ch.
  vii. entitled _Hwui hwui shi t’ou_ (“Precious Stones of the
  Mohammedans”) among the four kinds of red stones is mentioned the
  _si-la-ni_ of a dark red colour; _si-la-ni_, as Dr. Bretschneider
  observes (_Med. Res._ I. p. 174), means probably “from Ceylon.” The
  name for ruby in China is now-a-days _hung pao shi_, “red precious
  stone.” (_Ibid._ p. 173.)—H. C.]

                              CHAPTER XV.

      THE SAME CONTINUED. THE HISTORY OF SAGAMONI BORCAN AND THE
                        BEGINNING OF IDOLATRY.


Furthermore you must know that in the Island of Seilan there is an
exceeding high mountain; it rises right up so steep and precipitous
that no one could ascend it, were it not that they have taken and fixed
to it several great and massive iron chains, so disposed that by help
of these men are able to mount to the top. And I tell you they say that
on this mountain is the sepulchre of Adam our first parent; at least
that is what the Saracens say. But the Idolaters say that it is the
sepulchre of SAGAMONI BORCAN, before whose time there were no idols.
They hold him to have been the best of men, a great saint in fact,
according to their fashion, and the first in whose name idols were
made.{1}

He was the son, as their story goes, of a great and wealthy king.
And he was of such an holy temper that he would never listen to any
worldly talk, nor would he consent to be king. And when the father saw
that his son would not be king, nor yet take any part in affairs, he
took it sorely to heart. And first he tried to tempt him with great
promises, offering to crown him king, and to surrender all authority
into his hands. The son, however, would none of his offers; so the
father was in great trouble, and all the more that he had no other son
but him, to whom he might bequeath the kingdom at his own death. So,
after taking thought on the matter, the King caused a great palace to
be built, and placed his son therein, and caused him to be waited on
there by a number of maidens, the most beautiful that could anywhere
be found. And he ordered them to divert themselves with the prince,
night and day, and to sing and dance before him, so as to draw his
heart towards worldly enjoyments. But ’twas all of no avail, for none
of those maidens could ever tempt the king’s son to any wantonness, and
he only abode the firmer in his chastity, leading a most holy life,
after their manner thereof. And I assure you he was so staid a youth
that he had never gone out of the palace, and thus he had never seen a
dead man, nor any one who was not hale and sound; for the father never
allowed any man that was aged or infirm to come into his presence. It
came to pass however one day that the young gentleman took a ride, and
by the roadside he beheld a dead man. The sight dismayed him greatly,
as he never had seen such a sight before. Incontinently he demanded of
those who were with him what thing that was? and then they told him it
was a dead man. “How, then,” quoth the king’s son, “do all men die?”
“Yea, forsooth,” said they. Whereupon the young gentleman said never a
word, but rode on right pensively. And after he had ridden a good way
he fell in with a very aged man who could no longer walk, and had not a
tooth in his head, having lost all because of his great age. And when
the king’s son beheld this old man he asked what that might mean, and
wherefore the man could not walk? Those who were with him replied that
it was through old age the man could walk no longer, and had lost all
his teeth. And so when the king’s son had thus learned about the dead
man and about the aged man, he turned back to his palace and said to
himself that he would abide no longer in this evil world, but would go
in search of Him Who dieth not, and Who had created him.{2}

So what did he one night but take his departure from the palace
privily, and betake himself to certain lofty and pathless mountains.
And there he did abide, leading a life of great hardship and sanctity,
and keeping great abstinence, just as if he had been a Christian.
Indeed, an he had but been so, he would have been a great saint of Our
Lord Jesus Christ, so good and pure was the life he led.{3} And when
he died they found his body and brought it to his father. And when the
father saw dead before him that son whom he loved better than himself,
he was near going distraught with sorrow. And he caused an image in the
similitude of his son to be wrought in gold and precious stones, and
caused all his people to adore it. And they all declared him to be a
god; and so they still say.{4}

They tell moreover that he hath died fourscore and four times. The
first time he died as a man, and came to life again as an ox; and then
he died as an ox and came to life again as a horse, and so on until he
had died fourscore and four times; and every time he became some kind
of animal. But when he died the eighty-fourth time they say he became
a god. And they do hold him for the greatest of all their gods. And
they tell that the aforesaid image of him was the first idol that the
Idolaters ever had; and from that have originated all the other idols.
And this befel in the Island of Seilan in India.

The Idolaters come thither on pilgrimage from very long distances and
with great devotion, just as Christians go to the shrine of Messer
Saint James in Gallicia. And they maintain that the monument on the
mountain is that of the king’s son, according to the story I have
been telling you; and that the teeth, and the hair, and the dish that
are there were those of the same king’s son, whose name was Sagamoni
Borcan, or Sagamoni the Saint. But the Saracens also come thither on
pilgrimage in great numbers, and _they_ say that it is the sepulchre of
Adam our first father, and that the teeth, and the hair, and the dish
were those of Adam.{5}

Whose they were in truth, God knoweth; howbeit, according to the Holy
Scripture of our Church, the sepulchre of Adam is not in that part of
the world.

Now it befel that the Great Kaan heard how on that mountain there was
the sepulchre of our first father Adam, and that some of his hair
and of his teeth, and the dish from which he used to eat, were still
preserved there. So he thought he would get hold of them somehow or
another, and despatched a great embassy for the purpose, in the year
of Christ, 1284. The ambassadors, with a great company, travelled on
by sea and by land until they arrived at the island of Seilan, and
presented themselves before the king. And they were so urgent with
him that they succeeded in getting two of the grinder teeth, which
were passing great and thick; and they also got some of the hair, and
the dish from which that personage used to eat, which is of a very
beautiful green porphyry. And when the Great Kaan’s ambassadors had
attained the object for which they had come they were greatly rejoiced,
and returned to their lord. And when they drew near to the great city
of Cambaluc, where the Great Kaan was staying, they sent him word that
they had brought back that for which he had sent them. On learning this
the Great Kaan was passing glad, and ordered all the ecclesiastics and
others to go forth to meet these reliques, which he was led to believe
were those of Adam.

And why should I make a long story of it? In sooth, the whole
population of Cambaluc went forth to meet those reliques, and the
ecclesiastics took them over and carried them to the Great Kaan, who
received them with great joy and reverence.{6} And they find it written
in their Scriptures that the virtue of that dish is such that if food
for one man be put therein it shall become enough for five men: and the
Great Kaan averred that he had proved the thing and found that it was
really true.{7}

So now you have heard how the Great Kaan came by those reliques; and a
mighty great treasure it did cost him! The reliques being, according to
the Idolaters, those of that king’s son.


  NOTE 1.—_Sagamoni Borcan_ is, as Marsden points out, SAKYA-MUNI,
  or Gautama-Buddha, with the affix BURKHAN, or “Divinity,” which is
  used by the Mongols as the synonym of _Buddha_.

  “The Dewa of Samantakúta (Adam’s Peak), Samana, having heard of
  the arrival of Budha (in Lanka or Ceylon) ... presented a request
  that he would leave an impression of his foot upon the mountain
  of which he was guardian.... In the midst of the assembled Dewas,
  Budha, looking towards the East, made the impression of his foot,
  in length three inches less than the cubit of the carpenter; and
  the impression remained as a seal to show that Lanka is the
  inheritance of Budha, and that his religion will here flourish.”
  (_Hardy’s Manual_, p. 212.)

  [Ma-Huan says (p. 212): “On landing (at Ceylon), there is to be
  seen on the shining rock at the base of the cliff, an impress of
  a foot two or more feet in length. The legend attached to it is,
  that it is the imprint of Shâkyamuni’s foot, made when he landed at
  this place, coming from the Ts’ui-lan (Nicobar) Islands. There is a
  little water in the hollow of the imprint of this foot, which never
  evaporates. People dip their hands in it and wash their faces, and
  rub their eyes with it, saying: ‘This is Buddha’s water, which will
  make us pure and clean.’”—H. C.]

  [Illustration: Adam’s Peak.

    “=Or est voir qe en ceste ysle a une montagne mout haut et si
    degrot de les rocches qe nul hi puent monter sus se ne en ceste
    mainere qe je voz dirai=” ...]

  “The veneration with which this majestic mountain has been regarded
  for ages, took its rise in all probability amongst the aborigines
  of Ceylon.... In a later age, ... the hollow in the lofty rock
  that crowns the summit was said by the Brahmans to be the footstep
  of Siva, by the Buddhists of Buddha, ... by the Gnostics of Ieu,
  by the Mahometans of Adam, whilst the Portuguese authorities were
  divided between the conflicting claims of St. Thomas and the eunuch
  of Candace, Queen of Ethiopia.” (_Tennent_, II. 133.)

  [“Near to the King’s residence there is a lofty mountain reaching
  to the skies. On the top of this mountain there is the impress of
  a man’s foot, which is sunk two feet deep in the rock, and is some
  eight or more feet long. This is said to be the impress of the foot
  of the ancestor of mankind, a Holy man called _A-tan_, otherwise
  P’an-Ku.” (_Ma-Huan_, p. 213.)—H. C.]

  Polo, however, says nothing of the _foot_; he speaks only of
  the _sepulchre_ of Adam, or of Sakya-muni. I have been unable
  to find any modern indication of the monument that was shown by
  the Mahomedans as the tomb, and sometimes as the house, of Adam;
  but such a structure there certainly was, perhaps an ancient
  _Kist-vaen_, or the like. John Marignolli, who was there about
  1349, has an interesting passage on the subject: “That exceeding
  high mountain hath a pinnacle of surpassing height, which on
  account of the clouds can rarely be seen. [The summit is lost in
  the clouds. (_Ibn Khordâdhbeh_, p. 43.)—H. C.] But God, pitying
  our tears, lighted it up one morning just before the sun rose, so
  that we beheld it glowing with the brightest flame. [They say that
  a flame bursts constantly, like a lightning, from the Summit of
  the mountain.—(_Ibn Khordâdhbeh_, p. 44.)—H. C.] In the way down
  from this mountain there is a fine level spot, still at a great
  height, and there you find in order: first, the mark of Adam’s
  foot; secondly, a certain statue of a sitting figure, with the left
  hand resting on the knee, and the right hand raised and extended
  towards the west; lastly, there is the house (of Adam), which he
  made with his own hands. It is of an oblong quadrangular shape like
  a sepulchre, with a door in the middle, and is formed of great
  tabular slabs of marble, not cemented, but merely laid one upon
  another. (_Cathay_, 358.) A Chinese account, translated in _Amyot’s
  Mémoires_, says that at the foot of the mountain is a Monastery of
  Bonzes, in which is seen the veritable body of Fo, in the attitude
  of a man lying on his side” (XIV. 25). [Ma-Huan says (p. 212):
  “Buddhist temples abound there. In one of them there is to be seen
  a full length recumbent figure of Shâkyamuni, still in a very good
  state of preservation. The dais on which the figure reposes is
  inlaid with all kinds of precious stones. It is made of sandalwood
  and is very handsome. The temple contains a Buddha’s tooth and
  other relics. This must certainly be the place where Shâkyamuni
  entered Nirvâna.”—H. C.] Osorio, also, in his history of Emanuel
  of Portugal, says: “Not far from it (the Peak) people go to see a
  small temple in which are two sepulchres, which are the objects of
  an extraordinary degree of superstitious devotion. For they believe
  that in these were buried the bodies of the first man and his wife”
  (f. 120 _v_.). A German traveller (_Daniel Parthey_, Nürnberg,
  1698) also speaks of the tomb of Adam and his sons on the mountain.
  (See _Fabricius, Cod. Pseudep. Vet. Test._ II. 31; also _Ouseley’s
  Travels_, I. 59.)

  It is a perplexing circumstance that there is a double set of
  indications about the footmark. The Ceylon traditions, quoted
  above from Hardy, call its length 3 inches less than a carpenter’s
  cubit. Modern observers estimate it at 5 feet or 5½ feet. Hardy
  accounts for this by supposing that the original footmark was
  destroyed in the end of the sixteenth century. But Ibn Batuta, in
  the 14th, states it at 11 spans, or _more_ than the modern report.
  [Ibn Khordâdhbeh at 70 cubits.—H. C.] Marignolli, on the other
  hand, says that he measured it and found it to be 2½ palms, or
  about half a Prague ell, which corresponds in a general way with
  Hardy’s tradition. Valentyn calls it 1½ ell in length; Knox says
  2 feet; Herman Bree (De Bry?), quoted by Fabricius, 8½ spans; a
  Chinese account, quoted below, 8 feet. These discrepancies remind
  one of the ancient Buddhist belief regarding such footmarks, that
  they seemed greater or smaller in proportion to the faith of the
  visitor! (See _Koeppen_, I. 529, and _Beal’s Fah-hian_, p. 27.)

  The chains, of which Ibn Batuta gives a particular account,
  exist still. The highest was called (he says) the chain of the
  _Shahádat_, or Credo, because the fearful abyss below made pilgrims
  recite the profession of belief. Ashraf, a Persian poet of the
  15th century, author of an Alexandriad, ascribes these chains to
  the great conqueror, who devised them, with the assistance of the
  philosopher _Bolinas_,[1] in order to scale the mountain, and reach
  _the sepulchre of Adam_. (See _Ouseley_, I. 54 _seqq._) There are
  inscriptions on some of the chains, but I find no account of them.
  (_Skeen’s Adam’s Peak_, Ceylon, 1870, p. 226.)

  NOTE 2.—The general correctness with which Marco has here related
  the legendary history of Sakya’s devotion to an ascetic life, as
  the preliminary to his becoming the Buddha or Divinely Perfect
  Being, shows what a strong impression the tale had made upon him.
  He is, of course, wrong in placing the scene of the history in
  Ceylon, though probably it was so told him, as the vulgar in all
  Buddhist countries do seem to localise the legends in regions known
  to them.

  Sakya Sinha, Sakya Muni, or Gautama, originally called Siddhárta,
  was the son of Súddhodhana, the Kshatriya prince of Kapilavastu, a
  small state north of the Ganges, near the borders of Oudh. His high
  destiny had been foretold, as well as the objects that would move
  him to adopt the ascetic life. To keep these from his knowledge,
  his father caused three palaces to be built, within the limits of
  which the prince should pass the three seasons of the year, whilst
  guards were posted to bar the approach of the dreaded objects. But
  these precautions were defeated by inevitable destiny and the power
  of the Devas.

  When the prince was sixteen he was married to the beautiful
  Yasodhara, daughter of the King of Koli, and 40,000 other
  princesses also became the inmates of his harem.

  “Whilst living in the midst of the full enjoyment of every kind of
  pleasure, Siddhárta one day commanded his principal charioteer to
  prepare his festive chariot; and in obedience to his commands four
  lily-white horses were yoked. The prince leaped into the chariot,
  and proceeded towards a garden at a little distance from the
  palace, attended by a great retinue. On his way he saw a decrepit
  old man, with broken teeth, grey locks, and a form bending towards
  the ground, his trembling steps supported by a staff (a Deva had
  taken this form).... The prince enquired what strange figure it was
  that he saw; and he was informed that it was an old man. He then
  asked if the man was born so, and the charioteer answered that he
  was not, as he was once young like themselves. ‘Are there,’ said
  the prince, ‘many such beings in the world?’ ‘Your highness,’ said
  the charioteer, ‘there are many.’ The prince again enquired, ‘Shall
  I become thus old and decrepit?’ and he was told that it was a
  state at which all beings must arrive.”

  The prince returns home and informs his father of his intention to
  become an ascetic, seeing how undesirable is life tending to such
  decay. His father conjures him to put away such thoughts, and to
  enjoy himself with his princesses, and he strengthens the guards
  about the palaces. Four months later like circumstances recur, and
  the prince sees a leper, and after the same interval a dead body
  in corruption. Lastly, he sees a religious recluse, radiant with
  peace and tranquillity, and resolves to delay no longer. He leaves
  his palace at night, after a look at his wife Yasodhara and the boy
  just born to him, and betakes himself to the forests of Magadha,
  where he passes seven years in extreme asceticism. At the end of
  that time he attains the Buddhahood. (See _Hardy’s Manual_, p. 151
  _seqq._) The latter part of the story told by Marco, about the body
  of the prince being brought to his father, etc., is erroneous.
  Sakya was 80 years of age when he died under the sál trees in
  Kusinára.

  The strange parallel between Buddhistic ritual, discipline, and
  costume, and those which especially claim the name of CATHOLIC
  in the Christian Church, has been often noticed; and though the
  parallel has never been elaborated as it might be, some of the
  more salient facts are familiar to most readers. Still many may be
  unaware that Buddha himself, Siddhárta the son of Súddhodhana, has
  found his way into the Roman martyrology as a Saint of the Church.

  In the first edition a mere allusion was made to this singular
  story, for it had recently been treated by Professor Max Müller,
  with characteristic learning and grace. (See _Contemporary Review_
  for July, 1870, p. 588.) But the matter is so curious and still so
  little familiar that I now venture to give it at some length.

  The religious romance called the History of BARLAAM and JOSAPHAT
  was for several centuries one of the most popular works in
  Christendom. It was translated into all the chief European
  languages, including Scandinavian and Sclavonic tongues. An
  Icelandic version dates from the year 1204; one in the Tagal
  language of the Philippines was printed at Manilla in 1712.[2] The
  episodes and apologues with which the story abounds have furnished
  materials to poets and story-tellers in various ages and of very
  diverse characters; _e.g._ to Giovanni Boccaccio, John Gower, and
  to the compiler of the _Gesta Romanorum_, to Shakspere, and to the
  late W. Adams, author of the _King’s Messengers_. The basis of this
  romance is the story of Siddhárta.

  The story of Barlaam and Josaphat first appears among the works
  (in Greek) of St. John of Damascus, a theologian of the early part
  of the 8th century, who, before he devoted himself to divinity had
  held high office at the Court of the Khalif Abu Jáfar Almansúr. The
  outline of the story is as follows:—

  St. Thomas had converted the people of India to the truth; and
  after the eremitic life originated in Egypt many in India adopted
  it. But a potent pagan King arose, by name ABENNER, who persecuted
  the Christians and especially the ascetics. After this King had
  long been childless, a son, greatly desired, is born to him, a boy
  of matchless beauty. The King greatly rejoices, gives the child
  the name of JOSAPHAT, and summons the astrologers to predict his
  destiny. They foretell for the prince glory and prosperity beyond
  all his predecessors in the kingdom. One sage, most learned of all,
  assents to this, but declares that the scene of these glories will
  not be the paternal realm, and that the child will adopt the faith
  that his father persecutes.

  This prediction greatly troubled King Abenner. In a secluded city
  he caused a splendid palace to be erected, within which his son
  was to abide, attended only by tutors and servants in the flower
  of youth and health. No one from without was to have access to the
  prince; and he was to witness none of the afflictions of humanity,
  poverty, disease, old age, or death, but only what was pleasant, so
  that he should have no inducement to think of the future life; nor
  was he ever to hear a word of CHRIST or His religion. And, hearing
  that some monks still survived in India, the King in his wrath
  ordered that any such, who should be found after three days, should
  be burnt alive.

  The Prince grows up in seclusion, acquires all manner of learning,
  and exhibits singular endowments of wisdom and acuteness. At last
  he urges his father to allow him to pass the limits of the palace,
  and this the King reluctantly permits, after taking all precautions
  to arrange diverting spectacles, and to keep all painful objects
  at a distance. Or let us proceed in the Old English of the Golden
  Legend.[3] “Whan his fader herde this he was full of sorowe, and
  anone he let do make redy horses and ioyfull felawshyp to accompany
  him, in suche wyse that nothynge dyshonest sholde happen to hym.
  And on a tyme thus as the Kynges sone wente he mette a mesell and a
  blynde man, and whã he sawe them he was abasshed and enquyred what
  them eyled. And his seruaũtes sayd: These ben passions that comen
  to men. And he demaunded yf the passyons came to all men. And they
  sayd nay. Thã sayd he, ben they knowen whiche men shall suffre....
  And they answered, Who is he that may knowe ye aduentures of men.
  And he began to be moche anguysshous for ye incustomable thynge
  hereof. And another tyme he found a man moche aged, whiche had his
  chere froũced, his tethe fallen, and he was all croked for age....
  And thã he demaũnded what sholde be ye ende. And they sayd deth....
  And this yonge man remembered ofte in his herte these thynges, and
  was in grete dyscõforte, but he shewed hỹ moche glad tofore his
  fader, and he desyred moche to be enformed and taught in these
  thỹges.” [Fol. ccc. lii.]

  At this time BARLAAM, a monk of great sanctity and knowledge in
  divine things, who dwelt in the wilderness of Sennaritis, having
  received a divine warning, travels to India in the disguise of a
  merchant, and gains access to Prince Josaphat, to whom he unfolds
  the Christian doctrine and the blessedness of the monastic life.
  Suspicion is raised against Barlaam, and he departs. But all
  efforts to shake the Prince’s convictions are vain. As a last
  resource the King sends for a magician called Theudas, who removes
  the Prince’s attendants and substitutes seductive girls, but
  all their blandishments are resisted through prayer. The King
  abandons these attempts and associates his son with himself in the
  government. The Prince uses his power to promote religion, and
  everything prospers in his hand. Finally King Abenner is drawn to
  the truth, and after some years of penitence dies. Josaphat then
  surrenders the kingdom to a friend called Barachias, and proceeds
  into the wilderness, where he wanders for two years seeking
  Barlaam, and much buffeted by the demons. “And whan Balaam had
  accõplysshed his dayes, he rested in peas about ye yere of Our
  Lorde .cccc. & .lxxx. Josaphat lefte his realme the .xxv. yere of
  his age, and ledde the lyfe of an heremyte .xxxv. yere, and than
  rested in peas full of vertues, and was buryed by the body of
  Balaam.” [Fol. ccc. lvi.] The King Barachias afterwards arrives and
  transfers the bodies solemnly to India.

  This is but the skeleton of the story, but the episodes and
  apologues which round its dimensions, and give it its mediæval
  popularity, do not concern our subject. In this skeleton the story
  of Siddhárta, _mutatis mutandis_, is obvious.

  The story was first popular in the Greek Church, and was embodied
  in the lives of the saints, as recooked by Simeon the Metaphrast,
  an author whose period is disputed, but was in any case not later
  than 1150. A Cretan monk called Agapios made selections from the
  work of Simeon which were published in Romaic at Venice in 1541
  under the name of the _Paradise_, and in which the first section
  consists of the story of Barlaam and Josaphat. This has been
  frequently reprinted as a popular book of devotion. A copy before
  me is printed at Venice in 1865.[4]

  From the Greek Church the history of the two saints passed to the
  Latin, and they found a place in the Roman martyrology under the
  27th November. When this first happened I have not been able to
  ascertain. Their history occupies a large space in the _Speculum
  Historiale_ of Vincent of Beauvais, written in the 13th century,
  and is set forth, as we have seen, in the Golden Legend of nearly
  the same age. They are recognised by Baronius, and are to be found
  at p. 348 of “The Roman Martyrology set forth by command of Pope
  Gregory XIII., and revised by the authority of Pope Urban VIII.,
  translated out of Latin into English by G. K. of the Society of
  Jesus ... and now re-edited ... by W. N. Skelly, Esq. London, T.
  Richardson & Son.” (Printed at Derby, 1847.) Here in Palermo is a
  church bearing the dedication _Divo Iosaphat_.

  Professor Müller attributes the first recognition of the identity
  of the two stories to M. Laboulaye in 1859. But in fact I find that
  the historian de Couto had made the discovery long before.[5] He
  says, speaking of _Budão_ (Buddha), and after relating his history:

  “To this name the Gentiles throughout all India have dedicated
  great and superb pagodas. With reference to this story we have been
  diligent in enquiring if the ancient Gentiles of those parts had in
  their writings any knowledge of St. Josaphat who was converted by
  Barlam, who in his Legend is represented as the son of a great King
  of India, and who had just the same up-bringing, with all the same
  particulars, that we have recounted of the life of the Budão....
  And as a thing seems much to the purpose, which was told us by a
  very old man of the Salsette territory in Baçaim, about Josaphat,
  I think it well to cite it: As I was travelling in the Isle of
  Salsette, and went to see that rare and admirable Pagoda (which we
  call the Canará Pagoda[6]) made in a mountain, with many halls cut
  out of one solid rock ... and enquiring from this old man about
  the work, and what he thought as to who had made it, he told us
  that without doubt the work was made by order of the father of St.
  Josaphat to bring him up therein in seclusion, as the story tells.
  And as it informs us that he was the son of a great King in India,
  it may well be, as we have just said, that _he_ was the Budão, of
  whom they relate such marvels.” (Dec. V. liv. vi. cap. 2.)

  Dominie Valentyn, not being well read in the Golden Legend, remarks
  on the subject of Buddha: “There be some who hold this Budhum for a
  fugitive Syrian Jew, or for an Israelite, others who hold him for a
  Disciple of the Apostle Thomas; but how in that case he could have
  been born 622 years before Christ I leave them to explain. Diego de
  Couto stands by the belief that he was certainly _Joshua_, which is
  still more absurd!” (V. deel, p. 374.)

  [Since the days of Couto, who considered the Buddhist legend but
  an imitation of the Christian legend, the identity of the stories
  was recognised (as mentioned _supra_) by M. Edouard Laboulaye, in
  the _Journal des Débats_ of the 26th of July, 1859. About the same
  time, Professor F. Liebrecht of Liège, in _Ebert’s Jahrbuch für
  Romanische und Englische Literatur_, II. p. 314 _seqq._, comparing
  the Book of Barlaam and Joasaph with the work of Barthélemy St.
  Hilaire on Buddha, arrived at the same conclusion.

  In 1880, Professor T. W. Rhys Davids has devoted some pages
  (xxxvi.–xli.) in his _Buddhist Birth Stories; or, Jataka Tales_,
  to _The Barlaam and Josaphat Literature_, and we note from them
  that: “Pope Sixtus the Fifth (1585–1590) authorised a particular
  Martyrologium, drawn up by Cardinal Baronius, to be used throughout
  the Western Church.”. In that work are included not only the saints
  first canonised at Rome, but all those who, having been already
  canonised elsewhere, were then acknowledged by the Pope and the
  College of Rites to be saints of the Catholic Church of Christ.
  Among such, under the date of the 27th of November, are included
  “The holy Saints Barlaam and Josaphat, of India, on the borders of
  Persia, whose wonderful acts Saint John of Damascus has described.
  Where and when they were first canonised, I have been unable, in
  spite of much investigation, to ascertain. Petrus de Natalibus,
  who was Bishop of Equilium, the modern Jesolo, near Venice, from
  1370 to 1400, wrote a Martyrology called _Catalogus Sanctorum_; and
  in it, among the ‘Saints,’ he inserts both Barlaam and Josaphat,
  giving also a short account of them derived from the old Latin
  translation of St. John of Damascus. It is from this work that
  Baronius, the compiler of the authorised Martyrology now in use,
  took over the names of these two saints, Barlaam and Josaphat.
  But, so far as I have been able to ascertain, they do not occur in
  any martyrologies or lists of saints of the Western Church older
  than that of Petrus de Natalibus. In the corresponding manual of
  worship still used in the Greek Church, however, we find, under
  26th August, the name ‘of the holy Iosaph, son of Abenēr, King of
  India.’ Barlaam is not mentioned, and is not therefore recognised
  as a saint in the Greek Church. No history is added to the simple
  statement I have quoted; and I do not know on what authority it
  rests. But there is no doubt that it is in the East, and probably
  among the records of the ancient church of Syria, that a final
  solution of this question should be sought. Some of the more
  learned of the numerous writers who translated or composed new
  works on the basis of the story of Josaphat, have pointed out
  in their notes that he had been canonised; and the hero of the
  romance is usually called St. Josaphat in the titles of these
  works, as will be seen from the Table of the Josaphat literature
  below. But Professor Liebrecht, when identifying Josaphat with the
  Buddha, took no notice of this; and it was Professor Max Müller,
  who has done so much to infuse the glow of life into the dry
  bones of Oriental scholarship, who first pointed out the strange
  fact—almost incredible, were it not for the completeness of the
  proof—that Gotama the Buddha, under the name of St. Josaphat, is
  now officially recognised and honoured and worshipped throughout
  the whole of Catholic Christendom as a Christian saint!” Professor
  T. W. Rhys Davids gives further a Bibliography, pp. xcv.–xcvii.

  M. H. Zotenberg wrote a learned memoir (_N. et Ext._ XXVIII. Pt.
  I.) in 1886 to prove that the Greek Text is not a translation
  but the original of the Legend. There are many MSS. of the Greek
  Text of the Book of Barlaam and Joasaph in Paris, Vienna, Munich,
  etc., including ten MSS. kept in various libraries at Oxford.
  New researches made by Professor E. Kuhn, of Munich (_Barlaam
  und Joasaph. Eine Bibliographisch-literargeschichtliche Studie_,
  1893), seem to prove that during the 6th century, in that part
  of the Sassanian Empire bordering on India, in fact Afghanistan,
  Buddhism and Christianity were gaining ground at the expense of the
  Zoroastrian faith, and that some Buddhist wrote in Pehlevi a _Book
  of Yûdâsaf_ (Bodhisatva); a Christian, finding pleasant the legend,
  made an adaptation of it from his own point of view, introducing
  the character of the monk Balauhar (Barlaam) to teach his religion
  to Yûdâsaf, who could not, in his Christian disguise, arrive at the
  truth by himself like a Bodhisatva. This Pehlevi version of the
  newly-formed Christian legend was translated into Syriac, and from
  Syriac was drawn a Georgian version, and, in the first half of the
  7th century, the Greek Text of John, a monk of the convent of St.
  Saba, near Jerusalem, by some turned into St. John of Damascus, who
  added to the story some long theological discussions. From this
  Greek, it was translated into all the known languages of Europe,
  while the Pehlevi version being rendered into Arabic, was adapted
  by the Mussulmans and the Jews to their own creeds. (_H. Zotenberg,
  Mém. sur le texte et les versions orientales du Livre de Barlaam
  et Joasaph, Not. et Ext._ XXVIII. Pt. I. pp. 1–166; _G. Paris,
  Saint Josaphat_ in _Rev. de Paris_, 1ᵉʳ Juin, 1895, and _Poèmes et
  Légendes du Moyen Age_, pp. 181–214.)

  Mr. Joseph Jacobs published in London, 1896, a valuable little
  book, _Barlaam and Josaphat, English Lives of Buddha_, in which he
  comes to this conclusion (p. xli.): “I regard the literary history
  of the Barlaam literature as completely parallel with that of the
  Fables of Bidpai. Originally Buddhistic books, both lost their
  specifically Buddhistic traits before they left India, and made
  their appeal, by their parables, more than by their doctrines. Both
  were translated into Pehlevi in the reign of Chosroes, and from
  that watershed floated off into the literatures of all the great
  creeds. In Christianity alone, characteristically enough, one of
  them, the Barlaam book, was surcharged with dogma, and turned to
  polemical uses, with the curious result that Buddha became one of
  the champions of the Church. To divest the Barlaam-Buddha of this
  character, and see him in his original form, we must take a further
  journey and seek him in his home beyond the Himalayas.”

    Man.=”[7]]

  Professor Gaston Paris, in answer to Mr. Jacobs, writes (_Poèmes
  et Lég. du Moyen Age_, p. 213): “Mr. Jacobs thinks that the Book
  of Balauhar and Yûdâsaf was not originally Christian, and could
  have existed such as it is now in Buddhistic India, but it is
  hardly likely, as Buddha did not require the help of a teacher to
  find truth, and his followers would not have invented the person
  of Balauhar-Barlaam; on the other hand, the introduction of the
  Evangelical Parable of _The Sower_, which exists in the original
  of all the versions of our Book, shows that this original was a
  Christian adaptation of the Legend of Buddha. Mr. Jacobs seeks
  vainly to lessen the force of this proof in showing that this
  Parable has parallels in Buddhistic literature.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—Marco is not the only eminent person who has expressed
  this view of Sakyamuni’s life in such words. Professor Max Müller
  (_u.s._) says: “And whatever we may think of the sanctity of
  saints, let those who doubt the right of Buddha to a place among
  them, read the story of his life as it is told in the Buddhistic
  canon. If he lived the life which is there described, few saints
  have a better claim to the title than Buddha; and no one either in
  the Greek or the Roman Church need be ashamed of having paid to his
  memory the honour that was intended for St. Josaphat, the prince,
  the hermit, and the saint.”

  NOTE 4.—This is curiously like a passage in the _Wisdom of
  Solomon_: “Neque enim erant (idola) ab initio, neque erunt in
  perpetuum ... acerbo enim luctu dolens pater cito sibi rapti filii
  fecit imaginem: et illum qui tunc quasi homo mortuus fuerat nunc
  tamquam deum colere cœpit, et constituit inter servos suos sacra et
  sacrificia” (xiv. 13–15). Gower alludes to the same story; I know
  not whence taken:—

      “Of _Cirophanes_, seith the booke,
       That he for sorow, whiche he toke
       Of that he sigh his sonne dede,
       Of comfort knewe none other rede,
       But lete do make in remembrance
       A faire image of his semblance,
       And set it in the market place:
       Whiche openly to fore his face
       Stood euery day, to done hym ease;
       And thei that than wolden please
       The Fader, shuld it obeye,
       Whan that thei comen thilke weye.”—_Confessio Amantis_.[8]

  NOTE 5.—Adam’s Peak has for ages been a place of pilgrimage to
  Buddhists, Hindus, and Mahomedans, and appears still to be so. Ibn
  Batuta says the Mussulman pilgrimage was instituted in the 10th
  century. The book on the history of the Mussulmans in Malabar,
  called _Tohfat-ul-Mujáhidín_ (p. 48), ascribes their first
  settlement in that country to a party of pilgrims returning from
  Adam’s Peak. Marignolli, on his visit to the mountain, mentions
  “another pilgrim, a Saracen of Spain; for many go on pilgrimage to
  Adam.”

  The identification of Adam with objects of Indian worship occurs
  in various forms. Tod tells how an old Rajput Chief, as they stood
  before a famous temple of Mahádeo near Udipúr, invited him to
  enter and worship “Father Adam.” Another traveller relates how
  Brahmans of Bagesar on the Sarjú identified Mahadeo and Parvati
  with Adam and Eve. A Malay MS., treating of the _origines_ of Java,
  represents Brahma, Mahadeo, and Vishnu to be descendants of Adam
  through Seth. And in a Malay paraphrase of the Ramáyana, _Nabi
  Adam_ takes the place of Vishnu. (_Tod_ I. 96; _J. A. S. B._ XVI.
  233; _J. R. A. S._ N.S. II. 102; _J. Asiat._ IV. s. VII. 438.)

  NOTE 6.—The _Pâtra_, or alms-pot, was the most valued legacy
  of Buddha. It had served the three previous Buddhas of this
  world-period, and was destined to serve the future one, Maitreya.
  The Great Aṣoka sent it to Ceylon. Thence it was carried off by
  a Tamul chief in the 1st century, A.D., but brought back we know
  not how, and is still shown in the Malagawa Vihara at Kandy.
  As usual in such cases, there were rival reliques, for Fa-hian
  found the alms-pot preserved at Pesháwar. Hiuen Tsang says in
  his time it was no longer there, but in Persia. And indeed the
  _Pâtra_ from Pesháwar, according to a remarkable note by Sir Henry
  Rawlinson, is still preserved at Kandahár, under the name of
  _Kashkul_ (or the Begging-pot), and retains among the Mussulman
  Dervishes the sanctity and miraculous repute which it bore among
  the Buddhist _Bhikshus_. Sir Henry conjectures that the deportation
  of this vessel, the palladium of the true _Gandhára_ (Pesháwar),
  was accompanied by a popular emigration, and thus accounts for
  the transfer of that name also to the chief city of Arachosia.
  (_Koeppen_, I. 526; _Fah-hian_, p. 36; _H. Tsang_, II. 106; _J. R.
  A. S._ XI. 127.)

  Sir E. Tennent, through Mr. Wylie (to whom this book owes so
  much), obtained the following curious Chinese extract referring to
  Ceylon (written 1350): “In front of the image of Buddha there is a
  sacred bowl, which is neither made of jade nor copper, nor iron;
  it is of a purple colour, and glossy, and when struck it sounds
  like glass. At the commencement of the Yuen Dynasty (_i.e._ under
  Kúblái) three separate envoys were sent to obtain it.” Sanang
  Setzen also corroborates Marco’s statement: “Thus did the Khaghan
  (Kúblái) cause the sun of religion to rise over the dark land of
  the Mongols; he also procured from India images and reliques of
  Buddha; among others the _Pâtra_ of Buddha, which was presented
  to him by the four kings (of the cardinal points), and also the
  _chandana chu_” (a miraculous sandal-wood image). (_Tennent_, I.
  622; _Schmidt_, p. 119.)

  The text also says that several _teeth_ of Buddha were preserved in
  Ceylon, and that the Kaan’s embassy obtained two molars. Doubtless
  the envoys were imposed on; no solitary case in the amazing history
  of that relique, for _the_ Dalada, or tooth relique, seems in all
  historic times to have been unique. This, “the left canine tooth”
  of the Buddha, is related to have been preserved for 800 years at
  Dantapura (“_Odontopolis_”), in Kalinga, generally supposed to
  be the modern Púri or Jagannáth. Here the Brahmans once captured
  it and carried it off to Palibothra, where they tried in vain to
  destroy it. Its miraculous resistance converted the king, who sent
  it back to Kalinga. About A.D. 311 the daughter of King Guhaśiva
  fled with it to Ceylon. In the beginning of the 14th century it
  was captured by the Tamuls and carried to the Pandya country on
  the continent, but recovered some years later by King Parakrama
  III., who went in person to treat for it. In 1560 the Portuguese
  got possession of it and took it to Goa. The King of Pegu, who then
  reigned, probably the most powerful and wealthy monarch who has
  ever ruled in Further India, made unlimited offers in exchange for
  the tooth; but the archbishop prevented the viceroy from yielding
  to these temptations, and it was solemnly pounded to atoms by the
  prelate, then cast into a charcoal fire, and finally its ashes
  thrown into the river of Goa.

  The King of Pegu was, however, informed by a crafty minister of
  the King of Ceylon that only a sham tooth had been destroyed by
  the Portuguese, and that the real relique was still safe. This
  he obtained by extraordinary presents, and the account of its
  reception at Pegu, as quoted by Tennent from De Couto, is a curious
  parallel to Marco’s narrative of the Great Kaan’s reception of the
  Ceylon reliques at Cambaluc. The extraordinary object still so
  solemnly preserved at Kandy is another forgery, set up about the
  same time. So the immediate result of the viceroy’s virtue was that
  two reliques were worshipped instead of one!

  The possession of the tooth has always been a great object of
  desire to Buddhist sovereigns. In the 11th century King Anarauhta,
  of Burmah, sent a mission to Ceylon to endeavour to procure it, but
  he could obtain only a “miraculous emanation” of the relique. A
  tower to contain the sacred tooth was (1855), however, one of the
  buildings in the palace court of Amarapura. A few years ago the
  King of Burma repeated the mission of his remote predecessor, but
  obtained only a _model_, and this has been deposited within the
  walls of the palace at Mandalé, the new capital. (_Turnour_ in _J.

  Of the four eye-teeth of Sakya, one, it is related, passed to the
  heaven of Indra; the second to the capital of Gandhára; the third
  to Kalinga; the fourth to the snake-gods. The Gandhára tooth was
  perhaps, like the alms-bowl, carried off by a Sassanid invasion,
  and may be identical with that tooth of Fo, which the Chinese
  annals state to have been brought to China in A.D. 530 by a Persian
  embassy. A tooth of Buddha is now shown in a monastery at Fu-chau;
  but whether this be either the Sassanian present, or that got from
  Ceylon by Kúblái, is unknown. Other teeth of Buddha were shown
  in Hiuen Tsang’s time at Balkh, at Nagarahára (or Jalálábád), in
  Kashmir, and at Kanauj. (_Koeppen_, u.s.; _Fortune_, II. 108; _H.

  NOTE 7.—Fa-hian writes of the alms-pot at Pesháwar, that poor
  people could fill it with a few flowers, whilst a rich man should
  not be able to do so with 100, nay, with 1000 or 10,000 bushels of
  rice; a parable doubtless originally carrying a lesson, like Our
  Lord’s remark on the widow’s mite, but which hardened eventually
  into some foolish story like that in the text.

  The modern Mussulman story at Kandahar is that the alms-pot will
  contain any quantity of liquor without overflowing.

  This _Pâtra_ is the Holy Grail of Buddhism. Mystical powers of
  nourishment are ascribed also to the Grail in the European legends.
  German scholars have traced in the romances of the Grail remarkable
  indications of Oriental origin. It is not impossible that the
  alms-pot of Buddha was the prime source of them. Read the prophetic
  history of the _Pâtra_ as Fa-hian heard it in India (p. 161); its
  mysterious wanderings over Asia till it is taken up into the heaven
  _Tushita_, where Maitreya the Future Buddha dwells. When it has
  disappeared from earth the Law gradually perishes, and violence and
  wickedness more and more prevail:

                             CHAPTER XVI.

           CONCERNING THE GREAT PROVINCE OF MAABAR, WHICH IS
           CALLED INDIA THE GREATER, AND IS ON THE MAINLAND.


When you leave the Island of Seilan and sail westward about 60 miles,
you come to the great province of MAABAR which is styled INDIA THE
GREATER; it is best of all the Indies and is on the mainland.

You must know that in this province there are five kings, who are own
brothers. I will tell you about each in turn. The Province is the
finest and noblest in the world.

At this end of the Province reigns one of those five Royal Brothers,
who is a crowned King, and his name is SONDER BANDI DAVAR. In his
kingdom they find very fine and great pearls; and I will tell you how
they are got.{1}

You must know that the sea here forms a gulf between the Island of
Seilan and the mainland. And all round this gulf the water has a depth
of no more than 10 or 12 fathoms, and in some places no more than two
fathoms. The pearl-fishers take their vessels, great and small, and
proceed into this gulf, where they stop from the beginning of April
till the middle of May. They go first to a place called BETTELAR, and
(then) go 60 miles into the gulf. Here they cast anchor and shift from
their large vessels into small boats. You must know that the many
merchants who go divide into various companies, and each of these must
engage a number of men on wages, hiring them for April and half of May.
Of all the produce they have first to pay the King, as his royalty,
the tenth part. And they must also pay those men who charm the great
fishes, to prevent them from injuring the divers whilst engaged in
seeking pearls under water, one twentieth part of all that they take.
These fish-charmers are termed _Abraiaman_; and their charm holds good
for that day only, for at night they dissolve the charm so that the
fishes can work mischief at their will. These Abraiaman know also how
to charm beasts and birds and every living thing. When the men have got
into the small boats they jump into the water and dive to the bottom,
which may be at a depth of from 4 to 12 fathoms, and there they remain
as long as they are able. And there they find the shells that contain
the pearls [and these they put into a net bag tied round the waist, and
mount up to the surface with them, and then dive anew. When they can’t
hold their breath any longer they come up again, and after a little
down they go once more, and so they go on all day].{2} The shells are
in fashion like oysters or sea-hoods. And in these shells are found
pearls, great and small, of every kind, sticking in the flesh of the
shell-fish.

In this manner pearls are fished in great quantities, for thence in
fact come the pearls which are spread all over the world. And I can
tell you the King of that State hath a very great receipt and treasure
from his dues upon those pearls.

As soon as the middle of May is past, no more of those pearl-shells are
found there. It is true, however, that a long way from that spot, some
300 miles distant, they are also found; but that is in September and
the first half of October.


  NOTE 1.—MAABAR (_Ma’băr_) was the name given by the Mahomedans at
  this time (13th and 14th centuries) to a tract corresponding in
  a general way to what we call the Coromandel Coast. The word in
  Arabic signifies the Passage or Ferry, and may have referred either
  to the communication with Ceylon, or, as is more probable, to its
  being in that age the coast most frequented by travellers from
  Arabia and the Gulf.[1] The name does not appear in Edrisi, nor,
  I believe, in any of the older geographers, and the earliest use
  of it that I am aware of is in Abdallatif’s account of Egypt, a
  work written about 1203–1204. (_De Sacy, Rel. de l’Egypte_, p. 31.)
  Abulfeda distinctly names Cape Comorin as the point where Malabar
  ended and Ma’bar began, and other authority to be quoted presently
  informs us that it extended to _Niláwar_, _i.e._ Nellore.

  There are difficulties as to the particular locality of the port
  or city which Polo visited in the territory of the Prince whom
  he calls Sondar Bandi Davar; and there are like doubts as to the
  identification, from the dark and scanty Tamul records, of the
  Prince himself, and the family to which he belonged; though he is
  mentioned by more than one foreign writer besides Polo.

  Thus Wassáf: “Ma’bar extends in length from Kaulam to Niláwar,
  nearly 300 parasangs along the sea-coast; and in the language of
  that country the king is called Devar, which signifies, ‘the Lord
  of Empire.’ The curiosities of Chín and Máchín, and the beautiful
  products of Hind and Sind, laden on large ships which they call
  _Junks_, sailing like mountains with the wings of the wind on the
  surface of the water, are always arriving there. The wealth of the
  Isles of the Persian Gulf in particular, and in part the beauty and
  adornment of other countries, from ’Irak and Khurásán as far as Rúm
  and Europe, are derived from Ma’bar, which is so situated as to be
  the key of Hind.

  “A few years since the DEVAR was SUNDAR PANDI, who had three
  brothers, each of whom established himself in independence in some
  different country. The eminent prince, the Margrave (_Marzbán_)
  of Hind, Taki-uddin Abdu-r Rahmán, a son of Muhammad-ut-Tíbí,
  whose virtues and accomplishments have for a long time been the
  theme of praise and admiration among the chief inhabitants of that
  beautiful country, was the Devar’s deputy, minister, and adviser,
  and was a man of sound judgment. Fattan, Malifattan, and Káil[2]
  were made over to his possession.... In the months of the year 692
  H. (A.D. 1293) the above-mentioned Devar, the ruler of Ma’bar,
  died and left behind him much wealth and treasure. It is related
  by Malik-ul-Islám Jamáluddín, that out of that treasure 7000 oxen
  laden with precious stones and pure gold and silver fell to the
  share of the brother who succeeded him. Malik-i ’Azam Taki-uddin
  continued prime minister as before, and in fact ruler of that
  kingdom, and his glory and magnificence were raised a thousand
  times higher.”[3]

  Seventeen years later (1310) Wassáf introduces another king
  of Ma’bar called _Kalesa Devar_, who had ruled for forty
  years in prosperity, and had accumulated in the treasury of
  Shahr-Mandi (_i.e._, as Dr. Caldwell informs me MADURA, entitled
  by the Mahomedan invaders Shahr-Pandi, and still occasionally
  mispronounced _Shahr-Mandi_) 1200 crores (!) in gold. He had
  two sons, SUNDAR BANDI by a lawful wife, and Pirabandi (Vira
  Pandi?) illegitimate. He designated the latter as his successor.
  Sundar Bandi, enraged at this, slew his father and took forcible
  possession of Shahr-Mandi and its treasures. Pirabandi succeeded in
  driving him out; Sundar Bandi went to Aláuddin, Sultan of Delhi,
  and sought help. The Sultan eventually sent his general Hazárdinári
  (_alias_ Malik Káfúr) to conquer Ma’bar.

  In the third volume of Elliot we find some of the same main facts,
  with some differences and greater detail, as recounted by Amír
  Khusru. Bir Pandiya and Sundara Pandiya are the _Rais_ of Ma’bar,
  and are at war with one another, when the army of Alaúddin, after
  reducing Bilál Deo of Dwára Samudra, descends upon Ma’bar in the
  beginning of 1311 (p. 87 _seqq._).

  We see here two rulers in Ma’bar, within less than twenty years,
  bearing the name of Sundara Pandi. And, strange to say, more than
  a century before, during the continental wars of Parákráma Bahu
  I., the most martial of Singhalese kings (A.D. 1153–1186), we find
  _another Kulasaíkera_ (= _Kalesa_ of Wassáf), King of Madura, with
  _another Víra Pandi_ for son, and _another Sundara Pandi_ Rája,
  figuring in the history of the _Pandionis Regio_. But let no one
  rashly imagine that there is a confusion in the chronology here.
  The Hindu Chronology of the continental states is dark and confused
  enough, but not that of Ceylon, which in this, as in sundry other
  respects, comes under Indo-Chinese rather than Indian analogies.
  (See _Turnour’s Ceylonese Epitome_, pp. 41–43; and _J. A. S. B._
  XLI. Pt. I. p. 197 _seqq._)

  In a note with which Dr. Caldwell favoured me some time before the
  first publication of this work, he considers that the Sundar Bandi
  of Polo and the Persian Historians is undoubtedly to be identified
  with that Sundara Pandi Devar, who is in the Tamul Catalogues
  the last king of the ancient Pandya line, and who was (says Dr.
  Caldwell,) “succeeded by Mahomedans, by a new line of Pandyas,
  by the Náyak Kings, by the Nabobs of Arcot, and finally by the
  English. He became for a time a Jaina, but was reconverted to the
  worship of Siva, when his name was changed from _Kun_ or _Kubja_,
  ‘Crook-backed,’ to _Sundara_, ‘Beautiful,’ in accordance with a
  change which then took place, the Saivas say, in his personal
  appearance. Probably his name, from the beginning, was Sundara....
  In the inscriptions belonging to the period of his reign he is
  invariably represented, not as a joint king or viceroy, but as
  an absolute monarch ruling over an extensive tract of country,
  including the Chola country or Tanjore, and Conjeveram, and as the
  only possessor for the time being of the title _Pandi Devar_. It
  is clear from the agreement of Rashiduddin with Marco Polo that
  Sundara Pandi’s power was shared in some way with his brothers, but
  it seems certain also from the inscription that there was a sense
  in which he alone was king.”

  I do not give the whole of Dr. Caldwell’s remarks on this subject,
  because, the 3rd volume of Elliot not being then published, he had
  not before him the whole of the information from the Mussulman
  historians, which shows so clearly that _two_ princes bearing the
  name of Sundara Pandi are mentioned by them, and because I cannot
  see my way to adopt his view, great as is the weight due to his
  opinion on any such question.

  Extraordinary darkness hangs over the chronology of the South
  Indian kingdoms, as we may judge from the fact that Dr. Caldwell
  would have thus placed at the end of the 13th century, on the
  evidence of Polo and Rashiduddin, the reign of the last of the
  genuine Pandya kings, whom other calculations place earlier even
  by centuries. Thus, to omit views more extravagant, Mr. Nelson,
  the learned official historian of Madura, supposes it on the whole
  most probable that Kun Pandya _alias_ Sundara, reigned in the
  latter half of the 11th century. “The Sri Tala Book, which appears
  to have been written about 60 years ago, and was probably compiled
  from brief Tamil chronicles then in existence, states that the
  Pandya race became extinct upon the death of Kún Pandya; and the
  children of concubines and of younger brothers who (had) lived in
  former ages, fought against one another, split up the country into
  factions, and got themselves crowned, and ruled one in one place,
  another in another. But none of these families succeeded in getting
  possession of Madura, the capital, which consequently fell into
  decay. And further on it tells us, rather inconsistently, that up
  to A.D. 1324 the kings ‘who ruled the Madura country, were part
  of the time Pandyas, at other times foreigners.’” And a variety
  of traditions referred to by Mr. Nelson appears to interpose such
  a period of unsettlement and shifting and divided sovereignty,
  extending over a considerable time, between the end of the genuine
  Pandya Dynasty and the Mahomedan invasion; whilst lists of numerous
  princes who reigned in this period have been handed down. Now we
  have just seen that the Mahomedan invasion took place in 1311, and
  we must throw aside the traditions and the lists altogether if we
  suppose that the Sundara Pandi of 1292 was the last prince of the
  Old Line. Indeed, though the indication is faint, the manner in
  which Wassáf speaks of Polo’s Sundara and his brothers as having
  established themselves in different territories, and as in constant
  war with each other, is suggestive of the state of unsettlement
  which the Sri Tala and the traditions describe.

  There is a difficulty in co-ordinating these four or five brothers
  at constant war, whom Polo found in possession of different
  provinces of Ma’bar about 1290, with the Devar Kalesa, of whom
  Wassáf speaks as slain in 1310 after a prosperous reign of forty
  years. Possibly the brothers were adventurers who had divided the
  coast districts, whilst Kalesa still reigned with a more legitimate
  claim at Shahr-Mandi or Madura. And it is worthy of notice that the
  Ceylon Annals call the Pandi king whose army carried off the sacred
  tooth in 1303 _Kulasaikera_, a name which we may easily believe
  to represent Wassáf’s Kalesa. (_Nelson’s Madura_, 55, 67, 71–74;
  _Turnour’s Epitome_, p. 47.)

  As regards the position of the port of Ma’bar visited, but not
  named, by Marco Polo, and at or near which his Sundara Pandi seems
  to have resided, I am inclined to look for it rather in Tanjore
  than on the Gulf of Manar, south of the Rameshwaram shallows. The
  difficulties in this view are the indication of its being “60 miles
  west of Ceylon,” and the special mention of the Pearl Fishery in
  connection with it. We cannot, however, lay much stress upon Polo’s
  orientation. When his general direction is from east to west, every
  new place reached is for him _west_ of that last visited; whilst
  the Kaveri Delta is as near the north point of Ceylon as Ramnad is
  to Aripo. The pearl difficulty may be solved by the probability
  that the dominion of Sonder Bandi _extended_ to the coast of the
  Gulf of Manar.

  On the other hand Polo, below (ch. xx.), calls the province of
  Sundara Pandi _Soli_, which we can scarcely doubt to be _Chola_
  or _Soladesam_, _i.e._ Tanjore. He calls it also “the best and
  noblest Province of India,” a description which even with his
  limited knowledge of India he would scarcely apply to the coast of
  Ramnad, but which might be justifiably applied to the well-watered
  plains of Tanjore, even when as yet Arthur Cotton was not. Let it
  be noticed too that Polo in speaking (ch. xix.) of Mutfili (or
  Telingana) specifies its distance from Ma’bar as if he had made the
  run by sea from one to the other; but afterwards when he proceeds
  to speak of _Cail_, which stands on the Gulf of Manar, he does
  not specify its position or distance in regard to Sundara Pandi’s
  territory; an omission which he would not have been likely to make
  had _both_ lain on the Gulf of Manar.

  Abulfeda tells us that the capital of the Prince of Ma’bar, who was
  the great horse-importer, was called _Bíyardáwal_,[4] a name which
  now appears in the extracts from Amír Khusru (_Elliot_, III. 90–91)
  as _Birdhúl_, the capital of Bir Pandi mentioned above, whilst
  Madura was the residence of his brother, the later Sundara Pandi.
  And from the indications in those extracts it can be gathered, I
  think, that Birdhúl was not far from the Kaveri (called Kánobari),
  not far from the sea, and five or six days’ march from Madura.
  These indications point to Tanjore, Kombakonam, or some other
  city in or near the Kaveri Delta.[5] I should suppose that this
  Birdhúl was the capital of Polo’s Sundara Pandi, and that the port
  visited was Kaveripattanam. This was a great sea-port at one of
  the mouths of the Kaveri, which is said to have been destroyed by
  an inundation about the year 1300. According to Mr. Burnell it was
  the “_Paṭṭaṇam_ ‘par excellence’ of the Coromandel Coast, and the
  great port of the Chola kingdom.”[6]

     Chinese Pagoda (so called) at Negapatam. (From a sketch taken
     in 1846 by Sir Walter Elliot.)]

  Some corroboration of the supposition that the Tanjore ports were
  those frequented by Chinese trade may be found in the fact that
  a remarkable Pagoda of uncemented brickwork, about a mile to the
  north-west of Negapatam, popularly bears (or bore) the name of
  _the Chinese Pagoda_. I do not mean to imply that the building was
  Chinese, but that the application of that name to a ruin of strange
  character pointed to some tradition of Chinese visitors.[7] Sir
  Walter Elliot, to whom I am indebted for the sketch of it given
  here, states that this building differed essentially from any type
  of Hindu architecture with which he was acquainted, but being
  without inscription or sculpture it was impossible to assign to it
  any authentic origin. Negapatam was, however, celebrated as a seat
  of _Buddhist_ worship, and this may have been a remnant of their
  work. In 1846 it consisted of three stories divided by cornices of
  stepped brickwork. The interior was open to the top, and showed
  the marks of a floor about 20 feet from the ground. Its general
  appearance is shown by the cut. This interesting building was
  reported in 1859 to be in too dilapidated a state for repair, and
  now exists no longer. Sir W. Elliot also tells me that collectors
  employed by him picked up in the sand, at several stations on
  this coast, numerous Byzantine and _Chinese_ as well as Hindu
  coins.[8] The brickwork of the pagoda, as described by him, very
  fine and closely fitted but without cement, corresponds to that
  of the Burmese and Ceylonese mediæval Buddhist buildings. The
  _architecture_ has a slight resemblance to that of Pollanarua in
  Ceylon (see _Fergusson_, II. p. 512). (_Abulf._ in _Gildemeister_,
  p. 185; _Nelson_, Pt. II. p. 27 _seqq._; _Taylor’s Catalogue
  Raisonné_, III. 386–389.)

  Ma’bar is mentioned (_Mà-pa-’rh_) in the Chinese Annals as one of
  the foreign kingdoms which sent tribute to Kúblái in 1286 (_supra_,
  p. 296); and Pauthier has given some very curious and novel
  extracts from Chinese sources regarding the diplomatic intercourse
  with Ma’bar in 1280 and the following years. Among other points
  these mention the “five brothers who were Sultans” (_Suantan_), an
  envoy _Chamalating_ (Jumaluddín) who had been sent from Ma’bar to
  the Mongol Court, etc. (See pp. 603 _seqq._)

  NOTE 2.—Marco’s account of the pearl-fishery is still substantially
  correct. _Bettelar_, the rendezvous of the fishery, was, I imagine,
  PATLAM on the coast of Ceylon, called by Ibn Batuta _Batthála_.
  Though the centre of the pearl-fishery is now at Aripo and Kondachi
  further north, its site has varied sometimes as low as Chilaw,
  the name of which is a corruption of that given by the Tamuls,
  _Salábham_, which means “the Diving,” _i.e._ the Pearl-fishery.
  Tennent gives the meaning erroneously as “the Sea of Gain.” I owe
  the correction to Dr. Caldwell. (_Ceylon_, I. 440; _Pridham_, 409;
  _Ibn Bat._ IV. 166; _Ribeyro_, ed. Columbo, 1847, App. p. 196.)

  [Ma Huan (_J. North China B. R. A. S._ XX. p. 213) says that “the
  King (of Ceylon) has had an [artificial] pearl pond dug, into which
  every two or three years he orders pearl oysters to be thrown, and
  he appoints men to keep watch over it. Those who fish for these
  oysters, and take them to the authorities for the King’s use,
  sometimes steal and fraudulently sell them.”—H. C.]

  The shark-charmers do not now seem to have any claim to be called
  Abraiaman or Brahmans, but they may have been so in former days.
  At the diamond mines of the northern Circars Brahmans are employed
  in the analogous office of propitiating the tutelary genii. The
  shark-charmers are called in Tamul _Kaḍal-Kaṭṭi_, “Sea-binders,”
  and in Hindustani _Hai-banda_ or “Shark-binders.” At Aripo they
  belong to one family, supposed to have the monopoly of the charm.
  The chief operator is (or was, not many years ago) paid by
  Government, and he also received ten oysters from each boat daily
  during the fishery. Tennent, on his visit, found the incumbent of
  the office to be a Roman Catholic Christian, but that did not seem
  to affect the exercise or the validity of his functions. It is
  remarkable that when Tennent wrote, not more than one authenticated
  accident from sharks had taken place, during the whole period of
  the British occupation.

  The time of the fishery is a little earlier than Marco mentions,
  viz. in March and April, just between the cessation of the
  north-east and commencement of the south-west monsoon. His
  statement of the depth is quite correct; the diving is carried on
  in water of 4 to 10 fathoms deep, and never in a greater depth than
  13.

  I do not know the site of the other fishery to which he alludes as
  practised in September and October; but the time implies shelter
  from the south-west Monsoon, and it was probably on the east side
  of the island, where in 1750 there was a fishery, at Trincomalee.

    _Bár-ul-’Adwah_, “Terra Transitûs,” because thence they used to

[2] Wassáf has _Fitan, Mali Fitan, Kábil_, and meant the names so, as he
    shows by silly puns. For my justification in presuming to correct
    the names, I must refer to an article, in the _J. R. As. Soc._,
    N.S. IV. p. 347, on Rashiduddin’s Geography.

[3] The same information is given in almost the same terms by
    Rashiduddin. (See _Elliot_, I. 69.) But he (at least in Elliot’s
    translation) makes _Shaikh Jumaluddin_ the successor of the Devar,
    instead of merely the narrator of the circumstances. This is
    evidently a mistake, probably of transcription, and Wassáf gives us
    the true version.

    The members of the Arab family bearing the surname of At-Thaibí (or
    Thíbí) appear to have been powerful on the coasts of the Indian Sea
    at this time. (1) The Malik-ul-Islám Jamáluddin Ibrahim At-Thaibí
    was Farmer-General of Fars, besides being quasi-independent Prince
    of Kais and other Islands in the Persian Gulf, and at the time
    of his death (1306) governor of Shiraz. He had the horse trade
    with India greatly in his hands, as is mentioned in a note (7) on
    next chapter. (2) The son of Jamáluddin, Fakhruddin Ahmed, goes
    ambassador to the Great Kaan in 1297, and dies near the coast of
    Ma’bar on his way back in 1305. A Fakhruddin Ahmed _Ben Ibrahim_
    at-Thaibí also appears in Hammer’s extracts as ruler of Hormuz
    about the time of Polo’s return. (See _ante_, vol. i. p. 121); and
    though he is there represented as opposed by Shaikh Jumáluddin
    (perhaps through one of Hammer’s too frequent confusions), one
    should suppose that he must be the son just mentioned. (3)

[4] بيّرْدَاول

[5] My learned friend Mr. A. Burnell suggests that Birdhúl must
    have been Vriddachalam, _Virdachellam_ of the maps, which is in
    South Arcot, about 50 miles north of Tanjore. There are old and
    well-known temples there, and relics of fortifications. It is a
    rather famous place of pilgrimage.

[6] It was also perhaps the Fattan of the Mahomedan writers; but in
    that case its destruction must have been after Ibn Batuta’s time
    (say middle of 14th century).

[7] I leave this passage as it stood in the first edition. It is a
    mistake, but this mistake led to the engraving of Sir W. Elliot’s
    sketch (perhaps unique) of a very interesting building which has
    disappeared. Dr. Caldwell writes: “The native name was ‘the _Jaina
    Tower_,’ turned by the English into _China_ and _Chinese_. This I
    was told in Negapatam 30 years ago, but to make sure of the matter
    I have now written to Negapatam, and obtained from the Munsiff of
    the place confirmation of what I had heard long ago. It bore also
    the name of the ‘Tower of the _Malla_.’ The Chalukya Malla kings
    were at one time Jainas. The ‘Seven Pagodas’ near Madras bear their
    name, Ma-_Mallei_ pûram, and their power may at one time have
    extended as far south as Negapatam.” I have no doubt Dr. Caldwell
    is right in substance, but the name _China Pagoda_ at Negapatam is
    at least as old as Baldaeus (1672, p. 149), and the ascription to
    the Chinese is in Valentyn (1726, tom. v. p. 6). It is, I find, in
    the Atlas of India, “Jayne Pagoda.”

    coast. (_J. R. A. S._ I. 352–353.)




                             CHAPTER XVII.

             CONTINUES TO SPEAK OF THE PROVINCE OF MAABAR.


You must know that in all this Province of Maabar there is never a
Tailor to cut a coat or stitch it, seeing that everybody goes naked!
For decency only do they wear a scrap of cloth; and so ’tis with men
and women, with rich and poor, aye, and with the King himself, except
what I am going to mention.{1}

It is a fact that the King goes as bare as the rest, only round his
loins he has a piece of fine cloth, and round his neck he has a
necklace entirely of precious stones,—rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and
the like, insomuch that this collar is of great value.{2} He wears also
hanging in front of his chest from the neck downwards, a fine silk
thread strung with 104 large pearls and rubies of great price. The
reason why he wears this cord with the 104 great pearls and rubies, is
(according to what they tell) that every day, morning and evening, he
has to say 104 prayers to his idols. Such is their religion and their
custom. And thus did all the Kings his ancestors before him, and they
bequeathed the string of pearls to him that he should do the like. [The
prayer that they say daily consists of these words, _Pacauta! Pacauta!
Pacauta_! And this they repeat 104 times.{3}]

The King aforesaid also wears on his arms three golden bracelets
thickly set with pearls of great value, and anklets also of like kind
he wears on his legs, and rings on his toes likewise. So let me tell
you what this King wears, between gold and gems and pearls, is worth
more than a city’s ransom. And ’tis no wonder; for he hath great store
of such gear; and besides they are found in his kingdom. Moreover
nobody is permitted to take out of the kingdom a pearl weighing more
than half a _saggio_, unless he manages to do it secretly.{4} This
order has been given because the King desires to reserve all such
to himself; and so in fact the quantity he has is something almost
incredible. Moreover several times every year he sends his proclamation
through the realm that if any one who possesses a pearl or stone of
great value will bring it to him, he will pay for it twice as much as
it cost. Everybody is glad to do this, and thus the King gets all into
his own hands, giving every man his price.

Furthermore, this King hath some five hundred wives, for whenever he
hears of a beautiful damsel he takes her to wife. Indeed he did a
very sorry deed as I shall tell you. For seeing that his brother had
a handsome wife, he took her by force and kept her for himself. His
brother, being a discreet man, took the thing quietly and made no noise
about it. The King hath many children.

And there are about the King a number of Barons in attendance upon him.
These ride with him, and keep always near him, and have great authority
in the kingdom; they are called the King’s Trusty Lieges. And you must
know that when the King dies, and they put him on the fire to burn him,
these Lieges cast themselves into the fire round about his body, and
suffer themselves to be burnt along with him. For they say they have
been his comrades in this world, and that they ought also to keep him
company in the other world.{5}

When the King dies none of his children dares to touch his treasure.
For they say, “as our father did gather together all this treasure, so
we ought to accumulate as much in our turn.” And in this way it comes
to pass that there is an immensity of treasure accumulated in this
kingdom.{6}

Here are no horses bred; and thus a great part of the wealth of the
country is wasted in purchasing horses; I will tell you how. You must
know that the merchants of KIS and HORMES, DOFAR and SOER and ADEN
collect great numbers of destriers and other horses, and these they
bring to the territories of this King and of his four brothers, who are
kings likewise as I told you. For a horse will fetch among them 500
_saggi_ of gold, worth more than 100 marks of silver, and vast numbers
are sold there every year. Indeed this King wants to buy more than 2000
horses every year, and so do his four brothers who are kings likewise.
The reason why they want so many horses every year is that by the end
of the year there shall not be one hundred of them remaining, for they
all die off. And this arises from mismanagement, for those people do
not know in the least how to treat a horse; and besides they have no
farriers. The horse-merchants not only never bring any farriers with
them, but also prevent any farrier from going thither, lest that should
in any degree baulk the sale of horses, which brings them in every year
such vast gains. They bring these horses by sea aboard ship.{7}

They have in this country the custom which I am going to relate. When
a man is doomed to die for any crime, he may declare that he will put
himself to death in honour of such or such an idol; and the government
then grants him permission to do so. His kinsfolk and friends then set
him up on a cart, and provide him with twelve knives, and proceed to
conduct him all about the city, proclaiming aloud: “This valiant man
is going to slay himself for the love of (such an idol).” And when
they be come to the place of execution he takes a knife and sticks it
through his arm, and cries: “I slay myself for the love of (such a
god)!” Then he takes another knife and sticks it through his other arm,
and takes a third knife and runs it into his belly, and so on until
he kills himself outright. And when he is dead his kinsfolk take the
body and burn it with a joyful celebration.{8} Many of the women also,
when their husbands die and are placed on the pile to be burnt, do burn
themselves along with the bodies. And such women as do this have great
praise from all.{9}

The people are Idolaters, and many of them worship the ox, because (say
they) it is a creature of such excellence. They would not eat beef for
anything in the world, nor would they on any account kill an ox. But
there is another class of people who are called _Govy_, and these are
very glad to eat beef, though they dare not kill the animal. Howbeit if
an ox dies, naturally or otherwise, then they eat him.{10}

And let me tell you, the people of this country have a custom of
rubbing their houses all over with cow-dung.{11} Moreover all of them,
great and small, King and Barons included, do sit upon the ground only,
and the reason they give is that this is the most honourable way to
sit, because we all spring from the Earth and to the Earth we must
return; so no one can pay the Earth too much honour, and no one ought
to despise it.

And about that race of _Govis_, I should tell you that nothing on earth
would induce them to enter the place where Messer St. Thomas is—I
mean where his body lies, which is in a certain city of the province
of Maabar. Indeed, were even 20 or 30 men to lay hold of one of these
_Govis_ and to try to hold him in the place where the Body of the
Blessed Apostle of Jesus Christ lies buried, they could not do it! Such
is the influence of the Saint; for it was by people of this generation
that he was slain, as you shall presently hear.{12}

No wheat grows in this province, but rice only.

And another strange thing to be told is that there is no possibility of
breeding horses in this country, as hath often been proved by trial.
For even when a great blood-mare here has been covered by a great
blood-horse, the produce is nothing but a wretched wry-legged weed, not
fit to ride.{13}

The people of the country go to battle all naked, with only a lance and
a shield; and they are most wretched soldiers. They will kill neither
beast nor bird, nor anything that hath life; and for such animal food
as they eat, they make the Saracens, or others who are not of their own
religion, play the butcher.

It is their practice that every one, male and female, do wash the whole
body twice every day; and those who do not wash are looked on much as
we look on the Patarins. [You must know also that in eating they use
the right hand only, and would on no account touch their food with
the left hand. All cleanly and becoming uses are ministered to by the
right hand, whilst the left is reserved for uncleanly and disagreeable
necessities, such as cleansing the secret parts of the body and the
like. So also they drink only from drinking vessels, and every man hath
his own; nor will any one drink from another’s vessel. And when they
drink they do not put the vessel to the lips, but hold it aloft and let
the drink spout into the mouth. No one would on any account touch the
vessel with his mouth, nor give a stranger drink with it. But if the
stranger have no vessel of his own they will pour the drink into his
hands and he may thus drink from his hands as from a cup.]

They are very strict in executing justice upon criminals, and as
strict in abstaining from wine. Indeed they have made a rule that
wine-drinkers and seafaring men are never to be accepted as sureties.
For they say that to be a seafaring man is all the same as to be an
utter desperado, and that his testimony is good for nothing.[1] Howbeit
they look on lechery as no sin.

[They have the following rule about debts. If a debtor shall have been
several times asked by his creditor for payment, and shall have put him
off from day to day with promises, then if the creditor can once meet
the debtor and succeed in drawing a circle round him, the latter must
not pass out of this circle until he shall have satisfied the claim,
or given security for its discharge. If he in any other case presume
to pass the circle he is punished with death as a transgressor against
right and justice. And the said Messer Marco, when in this kingdom on
his return home, did himself witness a case of this. It was the King,
who owed a foreign merchant a certain sum of money, and though the
claim had often been presented, he always put it off with promises.
Now, one day when the King was riding through the city, the merchant
found his opportunity, and drew a circle round both King and horse.
The King, on seeing this, halted, and would ride no further; nor did
he stir from the spot until the merchant was satisfied. And when the
bystanders saw this they marvelled greatly, saying that the King was a
most just King indeed, having thus submitted to justice.{14}]

You must know that the heat here is sometimes so great that ’tis
something wonderful. And rain falls only for three months in the year,
viz. in June, July, and August. Indeed but for the rain that falls
in these three months, refreshing the earth and cooling the air, the
drought would be so great that no one could exist.{15}

They have many experts in an art which they call Physiognomy, by which
they discern a man’s character and qualities at once. They also know
the import of meeting with any particular bird or beast; for such
omens are regarded by them more than by any people in the world. Thus
if a man is going along the road and hears some one sneeze, if he deems
it (say) a good token for himself he goes on, but if otherwise he stops
a bit, or peradventure turns back altogether from his journey.{16}

As soon as a child is born they write down his nativity, that is to
say the day and hour, the month, and the moon’s age. This custom they
observe because every single thing they do is done with reference to
astrology, and by advice of diviners skilled in Sorcery and Magic and
Geomancy, and such like diabolical arts; and some of them are also
acquainted with Astrology.

[All parents who have male children, as soon as these have attained
the age of 13, dismiss them from their home, and do not allow them
further maintenance in the family. For they say that the boys are then
of an age to get their living by trade; so off they pack them with some
twenty or four-and-twenty groats, or at least with money equivalent to
that. And these urchins are running about all day from pillar to post,
buying and selling. At the time of the pearl-fishery they run to the
beach and purchase, from the fishers or others, five or six pearls,
according to their ability, and take these to the merchants, who are
keeping indoors for fear of the sun, and say to them: “These cost me
such a price; now give me what profit you please on them.” So the
merchant gives something over the cost price for their profit. They do
in the same way with many other articles, so that they become trained
to be very dexterous and keen traders. And every day they take their
food to their mothers to be cooked and served, but do not eat a scrap
at the expense of their fathers.]

In this kingdom and all over India the birds and beasts are entirely
different from ours, all but one bird which is exactly like ours,
and that is the Quail. But everything else is totally different. For
example they have bats,—I mean those birds that fly by night and have
no feathers of any kind; well, their birds of this kind are as big as a
goshawk! Their goshawks again are as black as crows, a good deal bigger
than ours, and very swift and sure.

Another strange thing is that they feed their horses with boiled rice
and boiled meat, and various other kinds of cooked food. That is the
reason why all the horses die off.{17}

They have certain abbeys in which are gods and goddesses to whom many
young girls are consecrated; their fathers and mothers presenting them
to that idol for which they entertain the greatest devotion. And when
the [monks] of a convent[2] desire to make a feast to their god, they
send for all those consecrated damsels and make them sing and dance
before the idol with great festivity. They also bring meats to feed
their idol withal; that is to say, the damsels prepare dishes of meat
and other good things and put the food before the idol, and leave it
there a good while, and then the damsels all go to their dancing and
singing and festivity for about as long as a great Baron might require
to eat his dinner. By that time they say the spirit of the idols has
consumed the substance of the food, so they remove the viands to be
eaten by themselves with great jollity. This is performed by these
damsels several times every year until they are married.{18}

[The reason assigned for summoning the damsels to these feasts is, as
the monks say, that the god is vexed and angry with the goddess, and
will hold no communication with her; and they say that if peace be not
established between them things will go from bad to worse, and they
never will bestow their grace and benediction. So they make those girls
come in the way described, to dance and sing, all but naked, before
the god and the goddess. And those people believe that the god often
solaces himself with the society of the goddess.

The men of this country have their beds made of very light canework, so
arranged that, when they have got in and are going to sleep, they are
drawn up by cords nearly to the ceiling and fixed there for the night.
This is done to get out of the way of tarantulas which give terrible
bites, as well as of fleas and such vermin, and at the same time to
get as much air as possible in the great heat which prevails in that
region. Not that everybody does this, but only the nobles and great
folks, for the others sleep on the streets.{19}]

Now I have told you about this kingdom of the province of Maabar, and
I must pass on to the other kingdoms of the same province, for I have
much to tell of their peculiarities.


  NOTE 1.—The non-existence of tailors is not a mere figure of
  speech. Sundry learned pundits have been of opinion that the
  ancient Hindu knew no needle-made clothing, and Colonel Meadows
  Taylor has alleged that they had not even a word for the tailor’s
  craft in their language. These opinions have been patriotically
  refuted by Bábú Rájendralál Mitra. (_Proc. As. Soc. B._ 1871, p.
  100.)

  Ibn Batuta describes the King of Calicut, the great “Zamorin,”
  coming down to the beach to see the wreck of certain Junks;—“his
  clothing consisted of a great piece of white stuff rolled about him
  from the navel to the knees, and a little scrap of a turban on his
  head; his feet were bare, and a young slave carried an umbrella
  over him.” (IV. 97.)

  NOTE 2.—The necklace taken from the neck of the Hindu King Jaipál,
  captured by Mahmúd in A.D. 1001, was composed of large pearls,
  rubies, etc., and was valued at 200,000 _dinars_, or a good deal
  more than 100,000_l._ (_Elliot_, II. 26.) Compare Correa’s account
  of the King of Calicut, in _Stanley’s V. da Gama_, 194.

  NOTE 3.—The word is printed in Ramusio _Pacauca_, but no doubt
  _Pacauta_ is the true reading. Dr. Caldwell has favoured me with
  a note on this: “The word ... was probably _Bagavâ_ or _Pagavâ_,
  the Tamil form of the vocative of _Bhagavata_, ‘Lord,’ pronounced
  in the Tamil manner. This word is frequently repeated by Hindus of
  all sects in the utterance of their sacred formulæ, especially by
  Vaishnava devotees, some of whom go about repeating this one word
  alone. When I mentioned Marco Polo’s word to two learned Hindus
  at different times, they said, ‘No doubt he meant _Bagava_.’[3]
  The Saiva Rosary contains 32 beads; the doubled form of the same,
  sometimes used, contains 64; the Vaishnava Rosary contains 108.
  Possibly the latter may have been meant by Marco.” [Captain Gill
  (_River of Golden Sand_, II. p. 341) at Yung-Ch’ang, speaking of
  the beads of a necklace, writes: “One hundred and eight is the
  regulation number, no one venturing to wear a necklace, with one
  bead more or less.”]

  Ward says: “The Hindús believe the repetition of the name of God
  is an act of adoration.... _Jăpă_ (as this act is called) makes an
  essential part of the daily worship.... The worshipper, taking a
  string of beads, repeats the name of his guardian deity, or that of
  any other god, counting by his beads 10, 28, 108, 208, adding to
  every 108 not less than 100 more.” (Madras ed. 1863, pp. 217–218.)

  No doubt the number in the text should have been 108, which is
  apparently a mystic number among both Brahmans and Buddhists. Thus
  at Gautama’s birth 108 Brahmans were summoned to foretell his
  destiny; round the great White Pagoda at Peking are 108 pillars
  for illumination; 108 is the number of volumes constituting the
  Tibetan scripture called _Kahgyur_; the merit of copying this work
  is enhanced by the quality of the ink used, thus a copy in red
  is 108 times more meritorious than one in black, one in silver
  108² times, one in gold, 108³ times; according to the Malabar
  Chronicle Parasurama established in that country 108 Iswars, 108
  places of worship, and 108 Durga images; there are said to be 108
  shrines of especial sanctity in India; there are 108 _Upanishads_
  (a certain class of mystical Brahmanical sacred literature); 108
  rupees is frequently a sum devoted to alms; the rules of the
  Chinese Triad Society assign 108 blows as the punishment for
  certain offences;—108, according to Athenaeus, were the suitors of
  Penelope! I find a Tibetan tract quoted (by _Koeppen_, II. 284) as
  entitled, “The Entire Victor over all the 104 Devils,” and this is
  the only example I have met with of 104 as a mystic number.

  NOTE 4.—The _Saggio_, here as elsewhere, probably stands for the
  _Miṣḳál_.

  NOTE 5.—This is stated also by Abu Zaid, in the beginning of the
  10th century. And Reinaud in his note refers to Mas’udi, who has a
  like passage in which he gives a name to these companions exactly
  corresponding to Polo’s _Féoilz_ or Trusty Lieges: “When a King
  in India dies, many persons voluntarily burn themselves with him.
  These are called _Balánjaríyah_ (sing. _Balánjar_), as if you
  should say ‘Faithful Friends’ of the deceased, whose life was life
  to them, and whose death was death to them.” (_Anc. Rel._ I. 121
  and note; _Mas._ II. 85.)

  On the murder of Ajit Singh of Marwar, by two of his sons, there
  were 84 _satis_, and “so much was he beloved,” says Tod, “that
  even men devoted themselves on his pyre” (I. 744). The same thing
  occurred at the death of the Sikh Gúrú Hargovind in 1645. (_H. of
  Sikhs_, p. 62.)

  Barbosa briefly notices an institution like that described by
  Polo, in reference to the King of Narsinga, _i.e._ Vijayanagar.
  (_Ram._ I. f. 302.) Another form of the same bond seems to be
  that mentioned by other travellers as prevalent in Malabar, where
  certain of the Nairs bore the name of _Amuki_, and were bound not
  only to defend the King’s life with their own, but, if he fell, to
  sacrifice themselves by dashing among the enemy and slaying until
  slain. Even Christian churches in Malabar had such hereditary
  _Amuki_. (See _P. Vinc. Maria_, Bk. IV. ch. vii., and _Cesare
  Federici_ in _Ram._ III. 390, also _Faria y Sousa_, by Stevens,
  I. 348.) There can be little doubt that this is the Malay _Amuk_,
  which would therefore appear to be of Indian origin, both in name
  and practice. I see that De Gubernatis, without noticing the
  Malay phrase, traces the term applied to the Malabar champions to
  the Sanskrit _Amokhya_, “indissoluble,” and _Amukta_, “not free,
  bound.” (_Picc. Encic. Ind._ I, 88.) The same practice, by which
  the followers of a defeated prince devote themselves in _amuk_
  (_vulgo_ running _á-muck_),[4] is called in the island of Bali
  _Bela_, a term applied also to one kind of female Sati, probably
  from S. _Bali_, “a sacrifice.” (See _Friedrich_ in _Batavian
  Trans._ XXIII.) In the first syllable of the _Balánjar_ of Mas’udi
  we have probably the same word. A similar institution is mentioned
  by Caesar among the Sotiates, a tribe of Aquitania. The _Féoilz_
  of the chief were 600 in number and were called _Soldurii_; they
  shared all his good things in life, and were bound to share with
  him in death also. Such also was a custom among the Spanish
  Iberians, and the name of these _Amuki_ signified “sprinkled
  for sacrifice.” Other generals, says Plutarch, might find a few
  such among their personal staff and dependents, but Sertorius
  was followed by many myriads who had thus devoted themselves.
  Procopius relates of the White Huns that the richer among them
  used to entertain a circle of friends, some score or more, as
  perpetual guests and partners of their wealth. But, when the chief
  died, the whole company were expected to go down alive into the
  tomb with him. The King of the Russians, in the tenth century,
  according to Ibn Fozlán, was attended by 400 followers bound by
  like vows. And according to some writers the same practice was
  common in Japan, where the friends and vassals who were under
  the vow committed _hara kiri_ at the death of their patron. The
  _Likamankwas_ of the Abyssinian kings, who in battle wear the same
  dress with their master to mislead the enemy—“Six Richmonds in the
  field”—form apparently a kindred institution. (_Bell. Gall._ iii.
  c. 22; _Plutarch, in Vit. Sertorii; Procop. De B. Pers._ I. 3; _Ibn
  Fozlan_ by _Fraehn_, p. 22; _Sonnerat_, I. 97.)

  NOTE 6.—However frequent may have been wars between adjoining
  states, the south of the peninsula appears to have been for ages
  free from foreign invasion until the Delhi expeditions, which
  occurred a few years later than our traveller’s visit; and there
  are many testimonies to the enormous accumulations of treasure.
  Gold, according to the _Masálak-al-Absár_, had been flowing into
  India for 3000 years, and had never been exported. Firishta speaks
  of the enormous spoils carried off by Malik Káfúr, every soldier’s
  share amounting to 25 lbs. of gold! Some years later Mahomed
  Tughlak loads 200 elephants and several thousand bullocks with the
  precious spoil of a single temple. We have quoted a like statement
  from Wassáf as to the wealth found in the treasury of this very
  Sundara Pandi Dewar, but the same author goes far beyond this
  when he tells that Kales Dewar, Raja of Ma’bar about 1309, had
  accumulated 1200 crores of gold, _i.e._ 12,000 millions of dinars,
  enough to girdle the earth with a four-fold belt of bezants!
  (_N. and E._ XIII. 218, 220–221; _Brigg’s Firishta_, I. 373–374;
  _Hammer’s Ilkhans_, II. 205.)

  NOTE 7.—Of the ports mentioned as exporting horses to India we have
  already made acquaintance with KAIS and HORMUZ; of DOFAR and ADEN
  we shall hear further on; _Soer_ is SOHÁR, the former capital of
  Oman, and still a place of some little trade. Edrisi calls it “one
  of the oldest cities of Oman, and of the richest. Anciently it was
  frequented by merchants from all parts of the world; and voyages to
  China used to be made from it.” (I. 152.)

  Rashiduddin and Wassáf have identical statements about the horse
  trade, and so similar to Polo’s in this chapter that one almost
  suspects that he must have been their authority. Wassáf says: “It
  was a matter of agreement that Malik-ul-Islám Jamáluddín and the
  merchants should embark every year from the island of KAIS and land
  at MA’BAR 1400 horses of his own breed.... It was also agreed that
  he should embark as many as he could procure from all the isles of
  Persia, such as Kátif, Lahsá, Bahrein, Hurmuz, and Kalhátú. The
  price of each horse was fixed from of old at 220 dinars of red
  gold, on this condition, that if any horses should happen to die,
  the value of them should be paid from the royal treasury. It is
  related by authentic writers that in the reign of Atábek Abu Bakr
  of (Fars), 10,000 horses were annually exported from these places
  to Ma’bar, Kambáyat, and other ports in their neighbourhood, and
  the sum total of their value amounted to 2,200,000 dinars.... They
  bind them for 40 days in a stable with ropes and pegs, in order
  that they may get fat; and afterwards, without taking measures for
  training, and without stirrups and other appurtenances of riding,
  the Indian soldiers ride upon them like demons.... In a short time,
  the most strong, swift, fresh, and active horses become weak,
  slow, useless, and stupid. In short, they all become wretched and
  good for nothing.... There is, therefore, a constant necessity of
  getting new horses annually.” Amír Khusru mentions among Malik
  Kafúr’s plunder in Ma’bar, 5000 Arab and Syrian horses. (_Elliot_,
  III. 34, 93.)

  The price mentioned by Polo appears to be intended for 500 dinars,
  which in the then existing relations of the precious metals in Asia
  would be worth just about 100 marks of silver. Wassáf’s price, 220
  dinars of red gold, seems very inconsistent with this, but is not
  so materially, for it would appear that the _dinar of red gold_ (so
  called) was worth _two dinars_.[5]

  I noted an early use of the term _Arab chargers_ in the famous
  Bodleian copy of the Alexander Romance (1338):

      “Alexand’ descent du destrier Arrabis.”

  NOTE 8.—I have not found other mention of a condemned criminal
  being allowed thus to sacrifice himself; but such suicides in
  performance of religious vows have occurred in almost all parts of
  India in all ages. Friar Jordanus, after giving a similar account
  to that in the text of the parade of the victim, represents him
  as _cutting off his own head_ before the idol, with a peculiar
  two-handled knife “like those used in currying leather.” And
  strange as this sounds it is undoubtedly true. Ibn Batuta witnessed
  the suicidal feat at the Court of the Pagan King of Mul-Java
  (somewhere on the coast of the Gulf of Siam), and Mr. Ward, without
  any knowledge of these authorities, had heard that an instrument
  for this purpose was formerly preserved at Kshíra, a village of
  Bengal near Nadiya. The thing was called _Karavat_; it was a
  crescent-shaped knife, with chains attached to it forming stirrups,
  so adjusted that when the fanatic placed the edge to the back of
  his neck and his feet in the stirrups, by giving the latter a
  violent jerk his head was cut off. Padre Tieffentaller mentions a
  like instrument at Prág (or Allahabad). Durgavati, a famous Queen
  on the Nerbada, who fell in battle with the troops of Akbar, is
  asserted in a family inscription to have “severed her own head with
  a scimitar she held in her hand.” According to a wild legend told
  at Ujjain, the great king Vikramajit was in the habit of cutting
  off his own head _daily_, as an offering to Devi. On the last
  performance the head failed to re-attach itself as usual; and it is
  now preserved, petrified, in the temple of Harsuddi at that place.

  I never heard of anybody in Europe performing this extraordinary
  feat except Sir Jonah Barrington’s Irish mower, who made a dig at a
  salmon with the butt of his scythe-handle and dropt his own head in
  the pool! (_Jord._ 33; _I. B._ IV. 246; _Ward_, Madras ed. 249–250;
  _J. A. S. B._ XVII. 833; _Rás Mála_, II. 387.)

  NOTE 9.—Satis were very numerous in parts of S. India. In 1815
  there were one hundred in Tanjore alone. (_Ritter_, VI. 303; _J.
  Cathay_, p. 80.)

  NOTE 10.—“The people in this part of the country (Southern Mysore)
  consider the ox as a living god, who gives them bread; and in
  every village there are one or two bulls to whom weekly or monthly
  worship is performed.” (_F. Buchanan_, II. 174.) “The low-caste
  Hindus, called _Gavi_ by Marco Polo, were probably the caste now
  called _Paraiyar_ (by the English, _Pariahs_). The people of
  this caste do not venture to kill the cow, but when they find
  the carcase of a cow which has died from disease, or any other
  cause, they cook and eat it. The name _Paraiyar_, which means
  ‘Drummers,’ does not appear to be ancient.”[6] (_Note by the Rev.
  Dr. Caldwell_.)

  In the history of Sind called _Chach Namah_, the Hindus revile the
  Mahomedan invaders as _Chandáls_ and cow-eaters. (_Elliot_, I. 172,
  193). The low castes are often styled from their unrestricted diet,
  _e.g._ _Halál-Khor_ (P. “to whom all food is lawful”), _Sab-khawá_
  (H. “omnivorous”).

  Bábú Rájendralál Mitra has published a learned article on _Beef
  in ancient India_, showing that the ancient Brahmans were far
  from entertaining the modern horror of cow-killing. We may cite
  two of his numerous illustrations. _Goghna_, “a guest,” signifies
  literally “a cow-killer,” _i.e._ he for whom a cow is killed. And
  one of the sacrifices prescribed in the _Sútras_ bears the name of
  _Súla-gava_ “spit-cow,” _i.e._ roast-beef. (_J. A. S. B._ XLI. Pt.
  I. p. 174 _seqq._)

  NOTE 11.—The word in the G. T. is _losci dou buef_, which
  Pauthier’s text has converted into _suif de buef_—in reference
  to Hindus, a preposterous statement. Yet the very old Latin of
  the Soc. Géog. also has _pinguedinem_, and in a parallel passage
  about the Jogis (_infra_, ch. xx.), Ramusio’s text describes them as
  daubing themselves with powder of ox-_bones_ (_l’ossa_). Apparently
  _l’osci_ was not understood (It. _uscito_).

  NOTE 12.—Later travellers describe the descendants of St. Thomas’s
  murderers as marked by having one leg of immense size, _i.e._ by
  _elephantiasis_. The disease was therefore called by the Portuguese
  _Pejo de Santo Toma_.

  NOTE 13.—Mr. Nelson says of the Madura country: “The horse is a
  miserable, weedy, and vicious pony; having but one good quality,
  endurance. The breed is not indigenous, but the result of constant
  importations and a very limited amount of breeding.” (_The Madura
  Country_, Pt. II. p. 94.) The ill success in breeding horses was
  exaggerated to impossibility, and made to extend to all India.
  Thus a Persian historian, speaking of an elephant that was born in
  the stables of Khosru Parviz, observes that “never till then had a
  she-elephant borne young in Irán, any more than a lioness in Rúm,
  a tabby cat in China (!), or _a mare in India_.” (_J. A. S._ sér.
  III. tom. iii. p. 127.)

  [Major-General Crawford T. Chamberlain, C.S.I., in a report on Stud
  Matters in India, 27th June 1874, writes: “I ask how it is possible
  that horses could be bred at a moderate cost in the Central
  Division, when everything was against success. I account for the
  narrow-chested, congenitally unfit and malformed stock, also
  for the creaking joints, knuckle over futtocks, elbows in, toes
  out, seedy toe, bad action, weedy frames, and other degeneracy:
  1st, to a damp climate, altogether inimical to horses; 2nd, to
  the operations being intrusted to a race of people inhabiting a
  country where horses are not indigenous, and who therefore have no
  taste for them ...; 5th, treatment of mares. To the impure air in
  confined, non-ventilated hovels, etc.; 6th, improper food; 7th, to
  a chronic system of tall rearing and forcing.” (_MS. Note._—H. Y.)]

  NOTE 14.—This custom is described in much the same way by the
  Arabo-Persian Zakariah Kazwini, by Ludovico Varthema, and by
  Alexander Hamilton. Kazwini ascribes it to Ceylon. “If a debtor
  does not pay, the King sends to him a person who draws a line round
  him, wheresoever he chance to be; and beyond that circle he dares
  not to move until he shall have paid what he owes, or come to an
  agreement with his creditor. For if he should pass the circle the
  King fines him three times the amount of his debt; one-third of
  this fine goes to the creditor and two-thirds to the King.” Père
  Bouchet describes the strict regard paid to the arrest, but does
  not notice the symbolic circle. (_Gildem._ 197; _Varthema_, 147;
  _Ham._ I. 318; _Lett. Edif._ XIV. 370.)

  “The custom undoubtedly prevailed in this part of India at a
  former time. It is said that it still survives amongst the poorer
  classes in out-of-the-way parts of the country, but it is kept up
  by schoolboys in a serio-comic spirit as vigorously as ever. Marco
  does not mention a very essential part of the ceremony. The person
  who draws a circle round another imprecates upon him the name of a
  particular divinity, whose curse is to fall upon him if he breaks
  through the circle without satisfying the claim.” (_MS. Note by the
  Rev. Dr. Caldwell._)

  NOTE 15.—The statement about the only rains falling in June, July,
  and August is perplexing. “It is entirely inapplicable to every
  part of the Coromandel coast, to which alone the name Ma’bar
  seems to have been given, but it is quite true of the _western_
  coast generally.” (_Rev. Dr. C._) One can only suppose that Polo
  inadvertently applied to Maabar that which he knew to be true of
  the regions both west of it and east of it. The Coromandel coast
  derives its chief supply of rain from the north-east monsoon,
  beginning in October, whereas both eastern and western India have
  theirs from the south-west monsoon, between June and September.

  NOTE 16.—Abraham Roger says of the Hindus of the Coromandel coast:
  “They judge of lucky hours and moments also by trivial accidents,
  to which they pay great heed. Thus ’tis held to be a good omen to
  everybody when the bird _Garuda_ (which is a red hawk with a white
  ring round its neck) or the bird _Pala_ flies across the road in
  front of the person from right to left; but as regards other birds
  they have just the opposite notion.... If they are in a house
  anywhere, and have moved to go, and then any one should sneeze,
  they will go in again, regarding it as an ill omen,” etc. (_Abr.
  Roger_, pp. 75–76.)

  NOTE 17.—Quoth Wassáf: “It is a strange thing that when these
  horses arrive there, instead of giving them raw barley, they give
  them roasted barley and grain dressed with butter, and boiled cow’s
  milk to drink:—

      “Who gives sugar to an owl or a crow?
       Or who feeds a parrot with a carcase?
       A crow should be fed with carrion,
       And a parrot with candy and sugar.
       Who loads jewels on the back of an ass?
       Or who would approve of giving dressed almonds to a cow?”
                                                   —_Elliot_, III. 33.

  “Horses,” says Athanasius Nikitin, “are fed on peas; also on
  _Kicheri_, boiled with sugar and oil; early in the morning they get
  _shishenivo_.” This last word is a mystery. (_India in the XVth
  Century_, p. 10.)

  “Rice is frequently given by natives to their horses to fatten
  them, and a sheep’s head occasionally to strengthen them.” (_Note
  by Dr. Caldwell_.)

  The sheep’s head is peculiar to the Deccan, but _ghee_ (boiled
  butter) is given by natives to their horses, I believe, all over
  India. Even in the stables of Akbar an imperial horse drew daily
  2 lbs. of flour, 1½ lb. of sugar, and in winter ½ lb. of _ghee_!
  (_Ain. Akb._ 134.)

  It is told of Sir John Malcolm that at an English table where he
  was present, a brother officer from India had ventured to speak of
  the sheep’s head custom to an unbelieving audience. He appealed to
  Sir John, who only shook his head deprecatingly. After dinner the
  unfortunate story-teller remonstrated, but Sir John’s answer was
  only, “My dear fellow, they took you for one Munchausen; they would
  merely have taken me for another!”

  NOTE 18.—The nature of the institution of the Temple dancing-girls
  seems to have been scarcely understood by the Traveller. The like
  existed at ancient Corinth under the name of ἰερόδουλοι, which is
  nearly a translation of the Hindi name of the girls, _Deva-dási_.
  (_Strabo_, VIII. 6, § 20.) “Each (Dási) is married to an idol when
  quite young. The female children are generally brought up to the
  trade of the mothers. It is customary with a few castes to present
  their superfluous daughters to the Pagodas.” (_Nelson’s Madura
  Country_, Pt. II. 79.) A full account of this matter appears to
  have been read by Dr. Shortt of Madras before the Anthropological
  Society. But I have only seen a newspaper notice of it.

  NOTE 19.—The first part of this paragraph is rendered by Marsden:
  “The natives make use of a kind of bedstead or cot of very light
  canework, so ingeniously contrived that when they repose on them,
  and are inclined to sleep, _they can draw close the curtains about
  them by pulling a string_.” This is not translation. An approximate
  illustration of the real statement is found in Pyrard de Laval, who
  says (of the Maldive Islanders): “Their beds are hung up by four
  cords to a bar supported by two pillars.... The beds of the king,
  the grandees, and rich folk are made thus that they may be swung
  and rocked with facility.” (_Charton_, IV. 277.) In the _Rás Mála_
  swinging cots are several times alluded to. (I. 173, 247, 423.) In
  one case the bed is mentioned as suspended to the ceiling by chains.

    DISCOURSING OF THE PLACE WHERE LIETH THE BODY OF ST. THOMAS THE
                 APOSTLE; AND OF THE MIRACLES THEREOF.


[Illustration: Ancient Cross with Pehlevi Inscription on St. Thomas’s
  Mount, near Madras. (From Photograph.)]

The Body of Messer St. Thomas the Apostle lies in this province of
Maabar at a certain little town having no great population. ’Tis a
place where few traders go, because there is very little merchandize to
be got there, and it is a place not very accessible.{1} Both Christians
and Saracens, however, greatly frequent it in pilgrimage. For the
Saracens also do hold the Saint in great reverence, and say that he was
one of their own Saracens and a great prophet, giving him the title of
_Avarian_, which is as much as to say “Holy Man.”{2} The Christians
who go thither in pilgrimage take of the earth from the place where the
Saint was killed, and give a portion thereof to any one who is sick of
a quartan or a tertian fever; and by the power of God and of St. Thomas
the sick man is incontinently cured.{3} The earth, I should tell you,
is red. A very fine miracle occurred there in the year of Christ, 1288,
as I will now relate.

A certain Baron of that country, having great store of a certain kind
of corn that is called _rice_, had filled up with it all the houses
that belonged to the church, and stood round about it. The Christian
people in charge of the church were much distressed by his having thus
stuffed their houses with his rice; the pilgrims too had nowhere to lay
their heads; and they often begged the pagan Baron to remove his grain,
but he would do nothing of the kind. So one night the Saint himself
appeared with a fork in his hand, which he set at the Baron’s throat,
saying: “If thou void not my houses, that my pilgrims may have room,
thou shalt die an evil death,” and therewithal the Saint pressed him so
hard with the fork that he thought himself a dead man. And when morning
came he caused all the houses to be voided of his rice, and told
everybody what had befallen him at the Saint’s hands. So the Christians
were greatly rejoiced at this grand miracle, and rendered thanks to God
and to the blessed St. Thomas. Other great miracles do often come to
pass there, such as the healing of those who are sick or deformed, or
the like, especially such as be Christians.

[The Christians who have charge of the church have a great number of
the Indian Nut trees, whereby they get their living; and they pay to
one of those brother Kings six groats for each tree every month.[1]]

Now, I will tell you the manner in which the Christian brethren who
keep the church relate the story of the Saint’s death.

They tell that the Saint was in the wood outside his hermitage saying
his prayers; and round about him were many peacocks, for these are more
plentiful in that country than anywhere else. And one of the Idolaters
of that country being of the lineage of those called _Govi_ that I
told you of, having gone with his bow and arrows to shoot peafowl, not
seeing the Saint, let fly an arrow at one of the peacocks; and this
arrow struck the holy man in the right side, insomuch that he died of
the wound, sweetly addressing himself to his Creator. Before he came to
that place where he thus died he had been in Nubia, where he converted
much people to the faith of Jesus Christ.{4}

The children that are born here are black enough, but the blacker they
be the more they are thought of; wherefore from the day of their birth
their parents do rub them every week with oil of sesamé, so that they
become as black as devils. Moreover, they make their gods black and
their devils white, and the images of their saints they do paint black
all over.{5}

They have such faith in the ox, and hold it for a thing so holy, that
when they go to the wars they take of the hair of the wild-ox, whereof
I have elsewhere spoken, and wear it tied to the necks of their horses;
or, if serving on foot, they hang this hair to their shields, or attach
it to their own hair. And so this hair bears a high price, since
without it nobody goes to the wars in any good heart. For they believe
that any one who has it shall come scatheless out of battle.{6}


  NOTE 1.—The little town where the body of St. Thomas lay was
  MAILAPÚR, the name of which is still applied to a suburb of Madras
  about 3½ miles south of Fort St. George.

  NOTE 2.—The title of _Avarian_, given to St. Thomas by the
  Saracens, is judiciously explained by Joseph Scaliger to be the
  Arabic _Ḥawáriy_ (pl. _Ḥawáriyún_), ‘An Apostle of the Lord Jesus
  Christ.’ Scaliger somewhat hypercritically for the occasion finds
  fault with Marco for saying the word means “a holy man.” (_De
  Emendatione Temporum_, Lib. VII., Geneva, 1629, p. 680.)

  NOTE 3.—The use of the earth from the tomb of St. Thomas for
  miraculous cures is mentioned also by John Marignolli, who was there
  about 1348–1349. Assemani gives a special formula of the Nestorians
  for use in the application of this dust, which was administered to
  the sick in place of the unction of the Catholics. It ends with the
  words “_Signatur et sanctificatur hic_ Hanana _(pulvis) cum hac_
  Taibutha _(gratiâ) Sancti Thomae Apostoli in sanitatem et medelam
  corporis et animae, in nomen P. et F. et S.S._” (III. Pt. 2, 278.)
  The Abyssinians make a similar use of the earth from the tomb of
  their national Saint Tekla Haimanot. (_J. R. G. S._ X. 483.) And
  the Shíahs, on solemn occasions, partake of water in which has been
  mingled the dust of Kerbela.

  Fa-hian tells that the people of Magadha did the like, for the
  cure of headache, with earth from the place where lay the body of
  Kasyapa, a former Buddha. (_Beal_, p. 133.)

  [Illustration: The Little Mount of St. Thomas, near Madras.]

  NOTE 4.—Vague as is Polo’s indication of the position of the Shrine
  of St. Thomas, it is the first geographical identification of it
  that I know of, save one. At the very time of Polo’s homeward
  voyage, John of Monte Corvino on his way to China spent thirteen
  months in Maabar, and in a letter thence in 1292–1293 he speaks of
  the church of St. Thomas there, having buried in it the companion
  of his travels, Friar Nicholas of Pistoia.

  But the tradition of Thomas’s preaching in India is very old, so
  old that it probably is, in its simple form, true. St. Jerome
  accepts it, speaking of the Divine Word as being everywhere present
  in His fullness: “_cum Thomâ in India_, cum Petro Romae, cum Paulo
  in Illyrico,” etc. (_Scti. Hieron. Epistolae_, LIX., _ad Marcellam_.)
  So dispassionate a scholar as Professor H. H. Wilson speaks of the
  preaching and martyrdom of St. Thomas in S. India as “occurrences
  very far from invalidated by any arguments yet adduced against the
  truth of the tradition.” I do not know if the date is ascertainable
  of the very remarkable legend of St. Thomas in the apocryphal
  Acts of the Apostles, but it is presumably very old, though
  subsequent to the translation of the relics (real or supposed) to
  Edessa, in the year 394, which is alluded to in the story. And
  it is worthy of note that this legend places the martyrdom and
  original burial-place of the Saint _upon a mount_. Gregory of
  Tours (A.D. 544–595) relates that “in that place in India where
  the body of Thomas lay before it was transported to Edessa, there
  is a monastery and a temple of great size and excellent structure
  and ornament. In it God shows a wonderful miracle; for the lamp
  that stands alight before the place of sepulture keeps burning
  perpetually, night and day, by divine influence, for neither oil
  nor wick are ever renewed by human hands;” and this Gregory learned
  from one Theodorus, who had visited the spot.

  The apocryphal history of St. Thomas relates that while the Lord
  was still upon earth a certain King of India, whose name was
  Gondaphorus, sent to the west a certain merchant called Abban
  to seek a skilful architect to build him a palace, and the Lord
  sold Thomas to him as a slave of His own who was expert in such
  work. Thomas eventually converts King Gondaphorus, and proceeds to
  another country of India ruled by King _Meodeus_, where he is put
  to death by lances. M. Reinaud first, I believe, pointed out the
  remarkable fact that the name of the King Gondaphorus of the legend
  is the same with that of a King who has become known from the
  Indo-Scythian coins, _Gondophares_, Yndoferres, or _Gondaferres_.
  This gives great interest to a votive inscription found near
  Pesháwar, and now in the Lahore Museum, which appears to bear the
  name of the same King. This Professor Dowson has partially read:
  “In the 26th year of the great King Guna ... pharasa, on the
  seventh day of the month Vaisákha.”... General Cunningham has
  read the date with more claim to precision: “In the 26th year of
  King Guduphara, in the Samvat year 103, in the month of Vaisákh,
  the 4th day.”... But Professor Dowson now comes much closer to
  General Cunningham, and reads: “26th year of the King, the year
  100 of Samvat, 3rd day of Vaisákha.” (See _Rep. of R. As. Soc._,
  18th January, 1875.) In ordinary application of _Samvat_ (to era of
  Vikramaditya) A.S. 100 = A.D. 43; but the era meant here is as yet
  doubtful. Lassen put Yndoferres about 90 B.C., as Cunningham did
  formerly about 26 B.C. The chronology is very doubtful, but the
  evidence does not appear to be strong against the synchronism of
  the King and the legend. (See _Prinsep’s Essays_, II. 176, 177, and
  Mr. Thomas’s remarks at p. 214; _Trübner’s Record_, 30th June, 187;
  Cunningham’s _Desc. List of Buddhist Sculptures in Lahore Central
  Museum; Reinaud, Inde_, p. 95.)

  Here then may be a faint trace of a true apostolic history. But
  in the 16th and 17th centuries Roman Catholic ecclesiastical
  story-tellers seem to have striven in rivalry who should most
  recklessly expand the travels of St. Thomas. According to an
  abstract given by P. Vincenzo Maria, his preaching began in
  Mesopotamia, and extended through Bactria, etc., to China, “the
  States of the Great Mogul” (!) and Siam; he then revisited his
  first converts, and passed into Germany, thence to Brazil, “as
  relates P. Emanuel Nobriga,” and from that to Ethiopia. After thus
  carrying light to the four quarters of the World, the indefatigable
  Traveller and Missionary retook his way to India, converting
  Socotra as he passed, and then preached in Malabar, and on the
  Coromandel Coast, where he died, as already stated.

  Some parts of this strange rhapsody, besides the Indian mission,
  were no doubt of old date; for the Chaldaean breviary of the
  Malabar Church in its office of St. Thomas contains such passages
  as this: “By St. Thomas were the Chinese and the Ethiopians
  converted to the Truth;” and in an Anthem: “The Hindus, the
  Chinese, the Persians, and all the people of the Isles of the Sea,
  they who dwell in Syria and Armenia, in Javan and Romania, call
  Thomas to remembrance, and adore Thy Name, O Thou our Redeemer!”

  The Roman Martyrology calls the city of Martyrdom _Calamina_, but
  there is (I think) a fair presumption that the spot alluded to by
  Gregory of Tours was Mailapúr, and that the Shrine visited by King
  Alfred’s envoy, Sighelm, may have been the same.

  Marco, as we see, speaks of certain houses belonging to the church,
  and of certain Christians who kept it. Odoric, some thirty years
  later, found beside the church, “some 15 houses of Nestorians,”
  but the Church itself filled with idols. Conti, in the following
  century, speaks of the church in which St. Thomas lay buried, as
  large and beautiful, and says there were 1000 Nestorians in the
  city. Joseph of Cranganore, the Malabar Christian who came to
  Europe in 1501, speaks like our traveller of the worship paid to
  the Saint, even by the heathen, and compares the church to that
  of St. John and St. Paul at Venice. Certain Syrian bishops sent
  to India in 1504, whose report is given by Assemani, heard that
  the church had _begun_ to be occupied by some Christian people.
  But Barbosa, a few years later, found it half in ruins and in the
  charge of a Mahomedan Fakir, who kept a lamp burning.

  There are two St. Thomas’s Mounts in the same vicinity, the Great
  and the Little Mount. A church was built upon the former by the
  Portuguese and some sanctity attributed to it, especially in
  connection with the cross mentioned below, but I believe there is
  no doubt that the _Little Mount_ was the site of the ancient church.

  The Portuguese ignored the ancient translation of the Saint’s
  remains to Edessa, and in 1522, under the Viceroyalty of Duarte
  Menezes, a commission was sent to Mailapúr, or San Tomé as
  they called it, to search for the body. The narrative states
  circumstantially that the Apostle’s bones were found, besides
  those of the king whom he had converted, etc. The supposed relics
  were transferred to Goa, where they are still preserved in the
  Church of St. Thomas in that city. The question appears to have
  become a party one among Romanists in India, in connection with
  other differences, and I see that the authorities now ruling the
  Catholics at Madras are strong in disparagement of the special
  sanctity of the localities, and of the whole story connecting St.
  Thomas with Mailapúr. (_Greg. Turon. Lib. Mirac._ I. p. 85; _Tr. R.
  A. S._ I. 761; _Assemani_, III. Pt. II. pp. 32, 450; _Novus Orbis_
  (ed. 1555), p. 210; _Maffei_, Bk. VIII.; _Cathay_, pp. 81, 197,
  374–377, etc.)

  The account of the Saint’s death was no doubt that current among
  the native Christians, for it is told in much the same way by
  Marignolli and by Barbosa, and was related also in the same manner
  by one Diogo Fernandes, who gave evidence before the commission of
  Duarte Menezes, and who claimed to have been the first Portuguese
  visitor of the site. (See _De Couto_, Dec. V. Liv. vi. cap. 2, and
  Dec. VII. Liv. x. cap. 5.)

  [Illustration: St. Thomas Localities at Madras.]

  As Diogo de Couto relates the story of the localities, in the shape
  which it had taken by the middle of the 16th century, both Little
  and Great Mounts were the sites of Oratories which the Apostle
  had frequented; during prayer on the Little Mount he was attacked
  and wounded, but fled to the Great Mount, where he expired. In
  repairing a hermitage which here existed, in 1547, the workmen came
  upon a stone slab with a cross and inscription carved upon it. The
  story speedily developed itself that this was the cross which had
  been embraced by the dying Apostle, and its miraculous virtues soon
  obtained great fame. It was eventually set up over an altar in the
  Church of the Madonna, which was afterwards erected on the Great
  Mount, and there it still exists. A Brahman impostor professed to
  give an interpretation of the inscription as relating to the death
  of St. Thomas, etc., and this was long accepted. The cross seemed
  to have been long forgotten, when lately Mr. Burnell turned his
  attention to these and other like relics in Southern India. He has
  shown the inscription to be _Pehlvi_, and probably of the 7th or
  8th century. Mr. Fergusson considers the architectural character to
  be of the 9th. The interpretations of the Inscription as yet given
  are tentative and somewhat discrepant. Thus Mr. Burnell reads: “In
  punishment (?) by the cross (was) the suffering to this (one): (He)
  who is the true Christ and God above, and Guide for ever pure.”
  Professor Haug: “Whoever believes in the Messiah, and in God above,
  and also in the Holy Ghost, is in the grace of Him who bore the
  pain of the Cross.” Mr. Thomas reads the central part, between
  two small crosses, “✛ In the Name of Messiah ✛.” See _Kircher,
  China Illustrata_, p. 55 _seqq._; _De Couto_, u.s. (both of these
  have inaccurate representations of the cross); _Academy_, vol. v.
  (1874), p. 145, etc.; and Mr. Burnell’s pamphlet “_On some Pahlavi
  Inscriptions in South India_.” To his kindness I am indebted for
  the illustration (p. 351).

  15.)—_MS. Note._—H. Y.]

  The etymology of the name _Mayiláppúr_, popular among the native
  Christians, is “Peacock-Town,” and the peafowl are prominent in
  the old legend of St. Thomas. Polo gives it no name; Marignolli
  (_circa_ 1350) calls it _Mirapolis_, the Catalan Map (1375)
  _Mirapor_; Conti (_circa_ 1440) _Malepor_; Joseph of Cranganore
  (1500) _Milapar_ (or _Milapor_); De Barros and Couto, _Meliapor_.
  Mr. Burnell thinks it was probably _Malai_-ppuram, “Mount-Town”;
  and the same as the Malifatan of the Mahomedan writers; the last
  point needs further enquiry.

  NOTE 5.—Dr. Caldwell, speaking of the devil-worship of the Shanars
  of Tinnevelly (an important part of Ma’bar), says: “Where they
  erect an image in imitation of their Brahman neighbours, the devil
  is generally of Brahmanical lineage. Such images generally accord
  with those monstrous figures with which all over India orthodox
  Hindus depict the enemies of their gods, or the terrific forms of
  Siva or Durga. They are generally made of earthenware, and _painted
  white to look horrible in Hindu eyes_.” (_The Tinnevelly Shanars_,
  Madras, 1849, p. 18.)

  NOTE 6.—The use of the Yak’s tail as a military ornament had
  nothing to do with the sanctity of the Brahmani ox, but is one of
  the Pan-Asiatic usages, of which there are so many. A vivid account
  of the extravagant profusion with which swaggering heroes in South
  India used those ornaments will be found in _P. della Valle_, II.

                             CHAPTER XIX.

                  CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF MUTFILI.


When you leave Maabar and go about 1,000 miles in a northerly direction
you come to the kingdom of MUTFILI. This was formerly under the rule of
a King, and since his death, some forty years past, it has been under
his Queen, a lady of much discretion, who for the great love she bore
him never would marry another husband. And I can assure you that during
all that space of forty years she had administered her realm as well as
ever her husband did, or better; and as she was a lover of justice, of
equity, and of peace, she was more beloved by those of her kingdom than
ever was Lady or Lord of theirs before. The people are Idolaters, and
are tributary to nobody. They live on flesh, and rice, and milk.{1}

It is in this kingdom that diamonds are got; and I will tell you how.
There are certain lofty mountains in those parts; and when the winter
rains fall, which are very heavy, the waters come roaring down the
mountains in great torrents. When the rains are over, and the waters
from the mountains have ceased to flow, they search the beds of the
torrents and find plenty of diamonds. In summer also there are plenty
to be found in the mountains, but the heat of the sun is so great
that it is scarcely possible to go thither, nor is there then a drop
of water to be found. Moreover in those mountains great serpents are
rife to a marvellous degree, besides other vermin, and this owing to
the great heat. The serpents are also the most venomous in existence,
insomuch that any one going to that region runs fearful peril; for many
have been destroyed by these evil reptiles.

Now among these mountains there are certain great and deep valleys, to
the bottom of which there is no access. Wherefore the men who go in
search of the diamonds take with them pieces of flesh, as lean as they
can get, and these they cast into the bottom of a valley. Now there are
numbers of white eagles that haunt those mountains and feed upon the
serpents. When the eagles see the meat thrown down they pounce upon
it and carry it up to some rocky hill-top where they begin to rend
it. But there are men on the watch, and as soon as they see that the
eagles have settled they raise a loud shouting to drive them away. And
when the eagles are thus frightened away the men recover the pieces of
meat, and find them full of diamonds which have stuck to the meat down
in the bottom. For the abundance of diamonds down there in the depths
of the valleys is astonishing, but nobody can get down; and if one
could, it would be only to be incontinently devoured by the serpents
which are so rife there.

There is also another way of getting the diamonds. The people go to
the nests of those white eagles, of which there are many, and in their
droppings they find plenty of diamonds which the birds have swallowed
in devouring the meat that was cast into the valleys. And, when the
eagles themselves are taken, diamonds are found in their stomachs.

So now I have told you three different ways in which these stones are
found. No other country but this kingdom of Mutfili produces them, but
there they are found both abundantly and of large size. Those that are
brought to our part of the world are only the refuse, as it were, of
the finer and larger stones. For the flower of the diamonds and other
large gems, as well as the largest pearls, are all carried to the
Great Kaan and other Kings and Princes of those regions; in truth they
possess all the great treasures of the world.{2}

In this kingdom also are made the best and most delicate buckrams, and
those of highest price; in sooth they look like tissue of spider’s
web! There is no King nor Queen in the world but might be glad to wear
them.{3} The people have also the largest sheep in the world, and great
abundance of all the necessaries of life.

There is now no more to say; so I will next tell you about a province
called Lar from which the Abraiaman come.


  NOTE 1.—There is no doubt that the kingdom here spoken of is that
  of TELINGANA (_Tiling_ of the Mahomedan writers), then ruled by
  the Kákateya or Ganapati dynasty reigning at Warangol, north-east
  of Hyderabad. But Marco seems to give the kingdom the name of that
  place in it which was visited by himself or his informants. MUTFILI
  is, with the usual Arab modification (_e.g._ Perlec, Ferlec—Pattan,
  Faitan), a port called MOTUPALLÉ, in the Gantúr district of the
  Madras Presidency, about 170 miles north of Fort St. George. Though
  it has dropt out of most of our modern maps it still exists, and a
  notice of it is to be found in W. Hamilton, and in Milburne. The
  former says: “_Mutapali_, a town situated near the S. extremity
  of the northern Circars. A considerable coasting trade is carried
  on from hence in the craft navigated by natives,” which can
  come in closer to shore than at other ports on that coast.—[Cf.
  _Hunter_, _Gaz. India_, _Motupalli_, “now only an obscure fishing
  village.”—It is marked in _Constable’s Hand Atlas of India_.—H. C.]

  The proper territory of the Kingdom of Warangol lay inland, but the
  last reigning prince before Polo’s visit to India, by name Kakateya
  Pratapa Ganapati Rudra Deva, had made extensive conquests on the
  coast, including Nellore, and thence northward to the frontier of
  Orissa. This prince left no male issue, and his widow, RUDRAMA
  DEVI, daughter of the Raja of Devagiri, assumed the government
  and continued to hold it for twenty-eight, or, as another record
  states, for thirty-eight years, till the son of her daughter had
  attained majority. This was in 1292, or by the other account
  1295, when she transferred the royal authority to this grandson
  Pratapa Vira Rudra Deva, the “Luddur Deo” of Firishta, and the last
  Ganapati of any political moment. He was taken prisoner by the
  Delhi forces about 1323. We have evidently in Rudrama Devi the just
  and beloved Queen of our Traveller, who thus enables us to attach
  colour and character to what was an empty name in a dynastic list.
  (Compare _Wilson’s Mackenzie_, I. cxxx.; _Taylor’s Or. Hist. MSS._
  I. 18; _Do.’s Catalogue Raisonné_, III. 483.)

  Mutfili appears in the _Carta Catalana_ as _Butiflis_, and is there
  by some mistake made the site of St. Thomas’s Shrine. The distance
  from Maabar is in Ramusio only 500 miles—a preferable reading.

  NOTE 2.—Some of the Diamond Mines once so famous under the name of
  Golconda are in the alluvium of the Kistna River, some distance
  above the Delta, and others in the vicinity of Kaḍapa and Karnúl,
  both localities being in the territory of the kingdom we have been
  speaking of.

  The strange legend related here is very ancient and widely
  diffused. Its earliest known occurrence is in the Treatise of St.
  Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis in Cyprus, concerning the twelve
  Jewels in the _Rationale_ or Breastplate of the Hebrew High
  Priest, a work written before the end of the 4th century, wherein
  the tale is told of the _Jacinth_. It is distinctly referred to
  by Edrisi, who assigns its locality to the land of the _Kirkhîr_
  (probably Khirghiz) in Upper Asia. It appears in Kazwini’s _Wonders
  of Creation_, and is assigned by him to the Valley of the Moon
  among the mountains of Serendib. Sindbad the Sailor relates the
  story, as is well known, and his version is the closest of all to
  our author’s. [So _Les Merveilles de l’Inde_, pp. 128–129.—H. C.]
  It is found in the Chinese Narrative of the Campaigns of Hulaku,
  translated by both Rémusat and Pauthier. [We read in the _Si Shi
  Ki_, of Ch’ang Te, Chinese Envoy to Hulaku (1259), translated by
  Dr. Bretschneider (_Med. Res._ I. p. 151): “The _kin-kang tsuan_
  (diamonds) come from _Yin-du_ (Hindustan). The people take flesh
  and throw it into the great valleys (of the mountains). Then birds
  come and eat this flesh, after which diamonds are found in their
  excrements.”—H. C.] It is told in two different versions, once of
  the Diamond, and again of the Jacinth of Serendib, in the work on
  precious stones by Ahmed Taifáshi. It is one of the many stories in
  the scrap-book of Tzetzes. Nicolo Conti relates it of a mountain
  called Albenigaras, fifteen days’ journey in a northerly direction
  from Vijayanagar; and it is told again, apparently after Conti, by
  Julius Caesar Scaliger. It is related of diamonds and Balasses in
  the old Genoese MS., called that of Usodimare. A feeble form of the
  tale is quoted contemptuously by Garcias from one Francisco de
  Tamarra. And Haxthausen found it as a popular legend in Armenia.

  The story has a considerable resemblance to that which Herodotus
  tells of the way in which cinnamon was got by the Arabs (III. 111).
  No doubt the two are ramifications of the same legend.

  NOTE 3.—Here _buckram_ is clearly applied to fine cotton stuffs.
  The districts about Masulipatam were long famous both for muslins
  and for coloured chintzes. The fine muslins of _Masalia_ are
  mentioned in the Periplus. Indeed even in the time of Sakya Muni
  Kalinga was already famous for diaphanous muslins, as may be seen
  in a story related in the Buddhist Annals. (_J. A. S. B._ VI. 1086.)




                              CHAPTER XX.

       CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF LAR WHENCE THE BRAHMINS COME.


Lar is a Province lying towards the west when you quit the place where
the Body of St. Thomas lies; and all the _Abraiaman_ in the world come
from that province.{1}

You must know that these Abraiaman are the best merchants in the world,
and the most truthful, for they would not tell a lie for anything on
earth. [If a foreign merchant who does not know the ways of the country
applies to them and entrusts his goods to them, they will take charge
of these, and sell them in the most loyal manner, seeking zealously the
profit of the foreigner and asking no commission except what he pleases
to bestow.] They eat no flesh, and drink no wine, and live a life of
great chastity, having intercourse with no women except with their
wives; nor would they on any account take what belongs to another; so
their law commands. And they are all distinguished by wearing a thread
of cotton over one shoulder and tied under the other arm, so that it
crosses the breast and the back.

They have a rich and powerful King who is eager to purchase precious
stones and large pearls; and he sends these Abraiaman merchants into
the kingdom of Maabar called SOLI, which is the best and noblest
Province of India, and where the best pearls are found, to fetch him as
many of these as they can get, and he pays them double the cost price
for all. So in this way he has a vast treasure of such valuables.{2}

These Abraiaman are Idolaters; and they pay greater heed to signs
and omens than any people that exists. I will mention as an example
one of their customs. To every day of the week they assign an augury
of this sort. Suppose that there is some purchase in hand, he who
proposes to buy, when he gets up in the morning takes note of his own
shadow in the sun, which he says ought to be on that day of such and
such a length; and if his shadow be of the proper length for the day
he completes his purchase; if not, he will on no account do so, but
waits till his shadow corresponds with that prescribed. For there is a
length established for the shadow for every individual day of the week;
and the merchant will complete no business unless he finds his shadow
of the length set down for that particular day. [Also to each day in
the week they assign one unlucky hour, which they term _Choiach_. For
example, on Monday the hour of Half-tierce, on Tuesday that of Tierce,
on Wednesday Nones, and so on.{3}]

Again, if one of them is in the house, and is meditating a purchase,
should he see a tarantula (such as are very common in that country) on
the wall, provided it advances from a quarter that he deems lucky, he
will complete his purchase at once; but if it comes from a quarter that
he considers unlucky he will not do so on any inducement. Moreover,
if in going out, he hears any one sneeze, if it seems to him a good
omen he will go on, but if the reverse he will sit down on the spot
where he is, as long as he thinks that he ought to tarry before going
on again. Or, if in travelling along the road he sees a swallow fly
by, should its direction be lucky he will proceed, but if not he will
turn back again; in fact they are worse (in these whims) than so many
Patarins!{4}

These Abraiaman are very long-lived, owing to their extreme abstinence
in eating. And they never allow themselves to be let blood in any part
of the body. They have capital teeth, which is owing to a certain herb
they chew, which greatly improves their appearance, and is also very
good for the health.

There is another class of people called _Chughi_, who are indeed
properly Abraiaman, but they form a religious order devoted to the
Idols. They are extremely long-lived, every man of them living to 150
or 200 years. They eat very little, but what they do eat is good; rice
and milk chiefly. And these people make use of a very strange beverage;
for they make a potion of sulphur and quicksilver mixt together and
this they drink twice every month. This, they say, gives them long
life; and it is a potion they are used to take from their childhood.{5}

There are certain members of this Order who lead the most ascetic life
in the world, going stark naked; and these worship the Ox. Most of
them have a small ox of brass or pewter or gold which they wear tied
over the forehead. Moreover they take cow-dung and burn it, and make a
powder thereof; and make an ointment of it, and daub themselves withal,
doing this with as great devotion as Christians do show in using Holy
Water. [Also if they meet any one who treats them well, they daub a
little of this powder on the middle of his forehead.{6}]

They eat not from bowls or trenchers, but put their victuals on leaves
of the Apple of Paradise and other big leaves; these, however, they
use dry, never green. For they say the green leaves have a soul in
them, and so it would be a sin. And they would rather die than do what
they deem their Law pronounces to be sin. If any one asks how it comes
that they are not ashamed to go stark naked as they do, they say, “We
go naked because naked we came into the world, and we desire to have
nothing about us that is of this world. Moreover, we have no sin of
the flesh to be conscious of, and therefore we are not ashamed of our
nakedness, any more than you are to show your hand or your face. You
who are conscious of the sins of the flesh do well to have shame, and
to cover your nakedness.”

They would not kill an animal on any account, not even a fly, or a
flea, or a louse,{7} or anything in fact that has life; for they
say these have all souls, and it would be sin to do so. They eat no
vegetable in a green state, only such as are dry. And they sleep on
the ground stark naked, without a scrap of clothing on them or under
them, so that it is a marvel they don’t all die, in place of living so
long as I have told you. They fast every day in the year, and drink
nought but water. And when a novice has to be received among them they
keep him awhile in their convent, and make him follow their rule of
life. And then, when they desire to put him to the test, they send for
some of those girls who are devoted to the Idols, and make them try
the continence of the novice with their blandishments. If he remains
indifferent they retain him, but if he shows any emotion they expel him
from their society. For they say they will have no man of loose desires
among them.

They are such cruel and perfidious Idolaters that it is very devilry!
They say that they burn the bodies of the dead, because if they were
not burnt worms would be bred which would eat the body; and when no
more food remained for them these worms would die, and the soul
belonging to that body would bear the sin and the punishment of their
death. And that is why they burn their dead!

Now I have told you about a great part of the people of the great
Province of Maabar and their customs; but I have still other things to
tell of this same Province of Maabar, so I will speak of a city thereof
which is called Cail.


  NOTE 1.—The form of the word _Abraiaman, -main or -min_, by which
  Marco here and previously denotes the Brahmans, probably represents
  an incorrect Arabic plural, such as _Abráhamín_; the correct Arabic
  form is _Baráhimah_.

  What is said here of the Brahmans coming from “_Lar_, a province
  west of St. Thomas’s,” of their having a special King, etc., is all
  very obscure, and that I suspect through erroneous notions.

  LAR-DESA, “The Country of Lár,” properly _Láṭ-desa_, was an
  early name for the territory of Guzerat and the northern Konkan,
  embracing _Saimur_ (the modern Chaul, as I believe), Tana, and
  Baroch. It appears in Ptolemy in the form _Larike_. The sea to the
  west of that coast was in the early Mahomedan times called the Sea
  of Lár, and the language spoken on its shores is called by Mas’udi
  _Lári_. Abulfeda’s authority, Ibn Said, speaks of Lár and Guzerat
  as identical. That position would certainly be very ill described
  as lying west of Madras. The kingdom most nearly answering to
  that description in Polo’s age would be that of the Bellál Rajas
  of Dwara Samudra, which corresponded in a general way to modern
  Mysore. (_Mas’udi_, I. 330, 381; II. 85; _Gildem._ 185; _Elliot_,
  I. 66.)

  That Polo’s ideas on this subject were incorrect seems clear
  from his conception of the Brahmans as a class of _merchants_.
  Occasionally they may have acted as such, and especially as agents;
  but the only case I can find of Brahmans as a class adopting
  trade is that of the Konkani Brahmans, and they are said to have
  taken this step when expelled from Goa, which was their chief
  seat, by the Portuguese. Marsden supposes that there has been
  confusion between Brahmans and Banyans; and, as Guzerat or Lár
  was the country from which the latter chiefly came, there is much
  probability in this.

  The high virtues ascribed to the Brahmans and Indian merchants were
  perhaps in part matter of tradition, come down from the stories
  of Palladius and the like; but the eulogy is so constant among
  mediæval travellers that it must have had a solid foundation.
  In fact it would not be difficult to trace a chain of similar
  testimony from ancient times down to our own. Arrian says no Indian
  was ever accused of falsehood. Hiuen Tsang ascribes to the people
  of India eminent uprightness, honesty, and disinterestedness. Friar
  Jordanus (_circa_ 1330) says the people of Lesser India (Sind
  and Western India) were true in speech and eminent in justice;
  and we may also refer to the high character given to the Hindus
  by Abu’l Fazl. After 150 years of European trade indeed we find
  a sad deterioration. Padre Vincenzo (1672) speaks of fraud as
  greatly prevalent among the Hindu traders. It was then commonly
  said at Surat that it took three Jews to make a Chinaman, and
  three Chinamen to make a Banyan. Yet Pallas, in the last century,
  noticing the Banyan colony at Astrakhan, says its members were
  notable for an upright dealing that made them greatly preferable to
  Armenians. And that wise and admirable public servant, the late Sir
  William Sleeman, in our own time, has said that he knew no class
  of men in the world more strictly honourable than the mercantile
  classes of India.

  We know too well that there is a very different aspect of the
  matter. All extensive intercourse between two races far asunder
  in habits and ideas, seems to be demoralising in some degrees
  to both parties, especially to the weaker. But can we say that
  deterioration has been all on one side? In these days of lying
  labels and plastered shirtings does the character of English trade
  and English goods stand as high in Asia as it did half a century
  ago! (_Pèl. Boudd._ II. 83; _Jordanus_, p. 22; _Ayeen Akb._ III. 8;
  _P. Vincenzo_, p. 114; _Pallas, Beyträge_, III. 85; _Rambles and
  Recns._ II. 143.)

  NOTE 2.—The kingdom of Maabar called _Soli_ is CHOLA or SOLADESAM,
  of which Kanchi (Conjeveram) was the ancient capital.[1] In the
  Ceylon Annals the continental invaders are frequently termed
  _Solli_. The high terms of praise applied to it as “the best and
  noblest province of India,” seem to point to the well-watered
  fertility of Tanjore; but what is said of the pearls would extend
  the territory included to the shores of the Gulf of Manár.

  NOTE 3.—Abraham Roger gives from the Calendar of the Coromandel
  Brahmans the character, lucky or unlucky, of every hour of every
  day of the week; and there is also a chapter on the subject in
  _Sonnerat_ (I. 304 _seqq._). For a happy explanation of the term
  _Choiach_ I am indebted to Dr. Caldwell: “This apparently difficult
  word can be identified much more easily than most others. Hindu
  astrologers teach that there is an unlucky hour every day in the
  month, _i.e._ during the period of the moon’s abode in every
  _nákshatra_, or lunar mansion, throughout the lunation. This
  inauspicious period is called _Tyâjya_, ‘rejected.’ Its mean length
  is one hour and thirty-six minutes, European time. The precise
  moment when this period commences differs in each nákshatra, or
  (which comes to the same thing) in every day in the lunar month.
  It sometimes occurs in the daytime and sometimes at night;—see
  _Colonel Warren’s Kala Sankatila_, Madras, 1825, p. 388. The Tamil
  pronunciation of the word is _tiyâcham_, and when the nominative
  case-termination of the word is rejected, as all the Tamil
  case-terminations were by the Mahomedans, who were probably Marco
  Polo’s informants, it becomes _tiyâch_, to which form of the word
  Marco’s _Choiach_ is as near as could be expected.” (_MS. Note._)[2]

  The phrases used in the passage from Ramusio to express the time
  of day are taken from the canonical hours of prayer. The following
  passage from _Robert de Borron’s Romance of Merlin_ illustrates
  these terms: Gauvain “quand il se levoit le matin, avoit la force
  al millor chevalier del monde; et quant vint à heure de prime si
  li doubloit, et à heure de tierce aussi; et quant il vint à eure
  de midi si revenoit à sa première force ou il avoit esté le matin;
  et quant vint à eure de nonne et à toutes les seures de la nuit
  estoit-il toudis en sa première force.” (Quoted in introd. to
  _Messir Gauvain_, etc., edited by _C. Hippeau_, Paris, 1862, pp.
  xii.–xiii.) The term _Half-Tierce_ is frequent in mediæval Italian,
  _e.g._ in Dante:—

      “_Lèvati su, disse’l Maestro, in piede:
         La via è lunga, e’l cammino è malvagio:
       E già il Sole a_ mezza terza _riede._”  (Inf. xxxiv,)

  _Half-prime_ we have in Chaucer:—

      “Say forth thy tale and tary not the time
       Lo Depëford, and it is half way prime.”
                                  —(_Reeve’s Prologue._)

  Definitions of these terms as given by Sir H. Nicolas and Mr.
  Thomas Wright (_Chron. of Hist._ p. 195, and _Marco Polo_, p. 392)
  do not agree with those of Italian authorities; perhaps in the
  north they were applied with variation. Dante dwells on the matter
  in two passages of his _Convito_ (Tratt. III. cap. 6, and Tratt.
  IV. cap. 23); and the following diagram elucidates the terms in
  accordance with his words, and with other Italian authority, oral
  and literary:—

  NOTE 4.—Valentyn mentions among what the Coromandel Hindus
  reckon unlucky rencounters which will induce a man to turn back
  on the road: an empty can, buffaloes, donkeys, a dog or he-goat
  _without_ food in his mouth, a monkey, a loose hart, a goldsmith, a
  carpenter, a barber, a tailor, a cotton-cleaner, a smith, a widow,
  a corpse, a person coming from a funeral without having washed or
  changed, men carrying butter, oil, sweet milk, molasses, acids,
  iron, or weapons of war. Lucky objects to meet are an elephant, a
  camel, a laden cart, an unladen horse, a cow or bullock laden with
  water (if unladen ’tis an ill omen), a dog or he-goat _with_ food
  in the mouth, a cat on the right hand, one carrying meat, curds, or
  sugar, etc., etc. (p. 91). (See also _Sonnerat_, I. 73.)

  NOTE 5.—_Chughi_ of course stands for JOGI, used loosely for any
  Hindu ascetic. Arghun Khan of Persia (see Prologue, ch. xvii.),
  who was much given to alchemy and secret science, had asked of the
  Indian Bakhshis how they prolonged their lives to such an extent.
  They assured him that a mixture of sulphur and mercury was the
  Elixir of Longevity. Arghun accordingly took this precious potion
  for eight months;—and died shortly after! (See _Hammer_, _Ilkhans_,
  I. 391–393, and _Q. R._ p. 194.) Bernier mentions wandering Jogis
  who had the art of preparing mercury so admirably that one or two
  grains taken every morning restored the body to perfect health (II.
  130). The _Mercurius Vitae_ of Paracelsus, which, according to
  him, renewed youth, was composed chiefly of mercury and antimony.
  (_Opera_, II. 20.) Sulphur and mercury, combined under different
  conditions and proportions, were regarded by the Alchemists both
  of East and West as the origin of all the metals. Quicksilver
  was called the mother of the metals, and sulphur the father.

  who lead austere lives like the Taoists of China, but who, however,
  are married. These men from the time they are born do not have
  their heads shaved or combed, but plait their hair into several
  tails, which hang over their shoulders; they wear no clothes, but
  round their waists they fasten a strip of rattan, over which they
  hang a piece of white calico; they carry a conch-shell, which they
  blow as they go along the road; they are accompanied by their
  wives, who simply wear a small bit of cotton cloth round their
  loins. Alms of rice and money are given to them by the people whose
  houses they visit.”

  “I have read in a book that certain chiefs of Turkistán sent

  in India drugs were procurable which possessed the property of
  prolonging human life, by the use of which the King of India
  attained to a very great age ... and the chiefs of Turkistán
  begged that some of this medicine might be sent to them, and also
  information as to the method by which the Ráís preserved their
  health so long.” (_Elliot_, II. p. 174.)—H. C.]

  “The worship of the ox is still common enough, but I can find no

  I may add that the _Jangams_, a Linga-worshipping sect of Southern
  India, wear a copper or silver _linga_ either round the neck _or on

                             CHAPTER XXI.

                     CONCERNING THE CITY OF CAIL.


Cail is a great and noble city, and belongs to ASHAR, the eldest of
the five brother Kings. It is at this city that all the ships touch
that come from the west, as from Hormos and from Kis and from Aden, and
all Arabia, laden with horses and with other things for sale. And this
brings a great concourse of people from the country round about, and so
there is great business done in this city of Cail.{1}

The King possesses vast treasures, and wears upon his person great
store of rich jewels. He maintains great state and administers his
kingdom with great equity, and extends great favour to merchants and
foreigners, so that they are very glad to visit his city.{2}

This King has some 300 wives; for in those parts the man who has most
wives is most thought of.

As I told you before, there are in this great province of Maabar five
crowned Kings, who are all own brothers born of one father and of one
mother, and this king is one of them. Their mother is still living.
And when they disagree and go forth to war against one another, their
mother throws herself between them to prevent their fighting. And
should they persist in desiring to fight, she will take a knife and
threaten that if they will do so she will cut off the paps that suckled
them and rip open the womb that bare them, and so perish before their
eyes. In this way hath she full many a time brought them to desist. But
when she dies it will most assuredly happen that they will fall out and
destroy one another.{3}

[All the people of this city, as well as of the rest of India, have
a custom of perpetually keeping in the mouth a certain leaf called
_Tembul_, to gratify a certain habit and desire they have, continually
chewing it and spitting out the saliva that it excites. The Lords and
gentlefolks and the King have these leaves prepared with camphor and
other aromatic spices, and also mixt with quicklime. And this practice
was said to be very good for the health.{4} If any one desires to offer
a gross insult to another, when he meets him he spits this leaf or its
juice in his face. The other immediately runs before the King, relates
the insult that has been offered him, and demands leave to fight the
offender. The King supplies the arms, which are sword and target, and
all the people flock to see, and there the two fight till one of them
is killed. They must not use the point of the sword, for this the King
forbids.]{5}


  NOTE 1.—KAIL, now forgotten, was long a famous port on the coast
  of what is now the Tinnevelly District of the Madras Presidency.
  It is mentioned as a port of Ma’bar by our author’s contemporary
  Rashiduddin, though the name has been perverted by careless
  transcription into _Báwal_ and _Kábal_. (See _Elliot_, I. pp.
  69, 72.) It is also mistranscribed as _Kábil_ in Quatremère’s
  publication of Abdurrazzák, who mentions it as “a place situated
  opposite the island of Serendib, otherwise called Ceylon,” and as
  being the extremity of what he was led to regard as Malabar (p.
  19). It is mentioned as _Cahila_, the site of the pearl-fishery,
  by Nicolo Conti (p. 7). The _Roteiro_ of Vasco da Gama notes it as
  _Caell_, a state having a Mussulman King and a Christian (for which
  read _Káfir_) people. Here were many pearls. Giovanni d’Empoli
  notices it (_Gael_) also for the pearl-fishery, as do Varthema and
  Barbosa. From the latter we learn that it was still a considerable
  seaport, having rich Mahomedan merchants, and was visited by many
  ships from Malabar, Coromandel, and Bengal. In the time of the last
  writers it belonged to the King of Kaulam, who generally resided at
  Kail.

  The real site of this once celebrated port has, I believe, till
  now never been identified in any published work. I had supposed
  the still existing Káyalpaṭṭanam to have been in all probability
  the place, and I am again indebted to the kindness of the Rev. Dr.
  Caldwell for conclusive and most interesting information on this
  subject. He writes:

  “There are no relics of ancient greatness in Káyalpaṭṭanam, and no
  traditions of foreign trade, and it is admitted by its inhabitants
  to be a place of recent origin, which came into existence after
  the abandonment of the true Káyal. They state also that the
  name of Káyalpaṭṭanam has only recently been given to it, as a
  reminiscence of the older city, and that its original name was
  Sônagarpaṭṭanam.[1] There is another small port in the same
  neighbourhood, a little to the north of Káyalpaṭṭanam, called Pinna
  Cael in the maps, properly Punnei-Káyal, from _Punnei_, the Indian
  Laurel; but this is also a place of recent origin, and many of the
  inhabitants of this place, as of Káyalpaṭṭanam, state that their
  ancestors came originally from Káyal, subsequently to the removal
  of the Portuguese from that place to Tuticorin.

  “The Cail of Marco Polo, commonly called in the neighbourhood _Old
  Káyal_, and erroneously named _Koil_ in the Ordnance Map of India,
  is situated on the Tâmraparnî River, about a mile and a half from
  its mouth. The Tamil word _káyal_ means ‘a backwater, a lagoon,’
  and the map shows the existence of a large number of these _káyals_
  or backwaters near the mouth of the river. Many of these kayals
  have now dried up more or less completely, and in several of them
  salt-pans have been established. The name of Káyal was naturally
  given to a town erected on the margin of a _káyal_; and this
  circumstance occasioned also the adoption of the name of Punnei
  Káyal, and served to give currency to the name of Káyalpaṭṭanam
  assumed by Sônagarpaṭṭanam, both those places being in the vicinity
  of kayals.

  “KAYAL stood originally on or near the sea-beach, but it is now
  about a mile and a half inland, the sand carried down by the river
  having silted up the ancient harbour, and formed a waste sandy
  tract between the sea and the town. It has now shrunk into a petty
  village, inhabited partly by Mahommedans and partly by Roman
  Catholic fishermen of the Parava caste, with a still smaller hamlet
  adjoining inhabited by Brahmans and Vellalars; but unlikely as
  the place may now seem to have been identical with ‘the great and
  noble city’ described by Marco Polo, its identity is established by
  the relics of its ancient greatness which it still retains. Ruins
  of old fortifications, temples, storehouses, wells and tanks, are
  found everywhere along the coast for two or three miles north of
  the village of Kayal, and a mile and a half inland; the whole plain
  is covered with broken tiles and remnants of pottery, chiefly of
  China manufacture, and several mounds are apparent, in which,
  besides the shells of the pearl-oyster and broken pottery, mineral
  drugs (cinnabar, brimstone, etc.), such as are sold in the bazaars
  of sea-port towns, and a few ancient coins have been found. I send
  you herewith an interesting coin discovered in one of those mounds
  by Mr. R. Puckle, collector of Tinnevelly.[2]

  “The people of the place have forgotten the existence of any trade
  between Kayal and China, though the China pottery that lies all
  about testifies to its existence at some former period; but they
  retain a distinct tradition of its trade with the Arabian and
  Persian coasts, as vouched for by Marco Polo, that trade having
  in some degree survived to comparatively recent times.... Captain
  Phipps, the Master Attendant at Tuticorin, says: ‘The roadstead of
  Old Cael (Káyal) is still used by native craft when upon the coast
  and meeting with south winds, from which it is sheltered. The depth
  of water is 16 to 14 feet; I fancy years ago it was deeper....
  There is a surf on the bar at the entrance (of the river), but
  boats go through it at all times.’

                   *       *       *       *       *

  “I am tempted to carry this long account of Kayal a little further,
  so as to bring to light the _Kolkhoi_ [κόλχοι ἐμπόριον] of the
  Greek merchants, the situation of the older city being nearly
  identical with that of the more modern one. _Kolkhoi_, described
  by Ptolemy and the author of the Periplus as an emporium of the
  pearl-trade, as situated on the sea-coast to the east of Cape
  Comorin, and as giving its name to the Kolkhic Gulf or Gulf of
  Manaar, has been identified by Lassen with Keelkarei; but this
  identification is merely conjectural, founded on nothing better
  than a slight apparent resemblance in the names. Lassen could not
  have failed to identify Kolkhoi with KORKAI, the mother-city of
  Kayal, if he had been acquainted with its existence and claims.
  Korkai, properly KOLKAI (the _l_ being changed into _r_ by a
  modern refinement—it is still called _Kolka_ in Malayalam), holds
  an important place in Tamil traditions, being regarded as the
  birthplace of the Pandyan Dynasty, the place where the princes
  of that race ruled previously to their removal to Madura. One of
  the titles of the Pandyan Kings is ‘Ruler of Korkai.’ Korkai is
  situated two or three miles inland from Kayal, higher up the river.
  It is not marked in the Ordnance Map of India, but a village in
  the immediate neighbourhood of it, called _Mâramangalam_, ‘the
  Good-fortune of the Pandyas,’ will be found in the map. This
  place, together with several others in the neighbourhood, on both
  sides of the river, is proved by inscriptions and relics to have
  been formerly included in Korkai, and the whole intervening space
  between Korkai and Kayal exhibits traces of ancient dwellings. The
  people of Kayal maintain that their city was originally so large
  as to include Korkai, but there is much more probability in the
  tradition of the people of Korkai, which is to the effect that
  Korkai itself was originally a sea-port; that as the sea retired it
  became less and less suitable for trade, that Kayal rose as Korkai
  fell, and that at length, as the sea continued to retire, Kayal
  also was abandoned. They add that the trade for which the place was
  famous in ancient times was the trade in pearls.” In an article
  in the _Madras Journal_ (VII. 379) it is stated that at the great
  Siva Pagoda at Tinnevelly the earth used ceremonially at the annual
  festival is brought from Korkai, but no position is indicated.

  NOTE 2.—Dr. Caldwell again brings his invaluable aid:—

  “Marco Polo represents Kayal as being governed by a king whom he
  calls _Asciar_ (a name which you suppose to be intended to be
  pronounced _Ashar_), and says that this king of Kayal was the elder
  brother of Sonderbandi, the king of that part of the district of
  Maabar where he landed. There is a distinct tradition, not only
  amongst the people now inhabiting Kayal, but in the district
  of Tinnevelly generally, that Kayal, during the period of its
  greatness, was ruled by a king. This king is sometimes spoken of as
  one of ‘the Five Kings’ who reigned in various parts of Tinnevelly,
  but whether he was independent of the King of Madura, or only a
  viceroy, the people cannot now say.... The tradition of the people
  of Kayal is that ... _Sûr-Raja_ was the name of the last king of
  the place. They state that this last king was a Mahommedan, ...
  but though Sûr-Raja does not sound like the name of a Mahommedan
  prince, they all agree in asserting that this was his name.... Can
  this Sûr be the person whom Marco calls Asciar? Probably not, as
  Asciar seems to have been a Hindu by religion. I have discovered
  what appears to be a more probable identification in the name of
  a prince mentioned in an inscription on the walls of a temple at
  Sri-Vaikuntham, a town on the Tamraparni R., about 20 miles from
  Kayal. In the inscription in question a donation to the temple
  is recorded as having been given in the time of ‘_Asaḍia-deva
  called also Surya-deva_.’ This name ‘Asaḍia’ is neither Sanskrit
  nor Tamil; and as the hard _ḍ_ is often changed into _r_, Marco’s
  _Ashar_ may have been an attempt to render this _Asaḍ_. If this
  Asaḍia or Surya-deva were really Sundara-pandi-deva’s brother, he
  must have ruled over a narrow range of country, probably over Kayal
  alone, whilst his more eminent brother was alive; for there is an
  inscription on the walls of a temple at Sindamangalam, a place only
  a few miles from Kayal, which records a donation made to the place
  ‘in the reign of Sundara-pandi-deva.’”[3]

  NOTE 3.—[“O aljofar, e perolas, que me manda que lha enuie, nom
  as posso auer, que as ha em Ceylão e Caille, que são as fontes
  dellas: compralashia do meu sangue, a do meu dinheiro, que o
  tenho porque vós me daes.” (Letter of the Viceroy Dom Francisco
  to the King, Anno de 1508). (_G. Correa, Lendas da India_, I. pp.
  908–909.)—_Note by Yule_.]

  NOTE 4.—_Tembúl_ is the Persian name for the betel-leaf or _pán_,
  from the Sanskrit _Támbúla_. The latter is also used in Tamul,
  though _Vettilei_ is the proper Tamul word, whence _Betel_ (_Dr.
  Caldwell_). Marsden supposes the mention of camphor among the
  ingredients with which the pán is prepared to be a mistake, and
  suggests as a possible origin of the error that _kápúr_ in the
  Malay language means not only camphor but quicklime. This is
  curious, but in addition to the fact that the lime is mentioned in
  the text, there seems ample evidence that his doubt about camphor
  is unfounded.

  Garcia de Orta says distinctly: “In chewing _betre_ ... they mix
  areca with it and a little lime.... Some add _Licio_ (_i.e._
  catechu), _but the rich and grandees add some Borneo camphor_,
  and some also lign-aloes, musk, and ambergris” (31 v. and 32).
  Abdurrazzák also says: “The manner of eating it is as follows:
  They bruise a portion of _faufel_ (areca), otherwise called
  _sipari_, and put it in the mouth. Moistening a leaf of the betel,
  together with a grain of lime, they rub the one upon the other,
  roll them together, and then place them in the mouth. They thus
  take as many as four leaves of betel at a time and chew them.
  _Sometimes they add camphor to it_” (p. 32). And Abu’l Fazl: “They
  also put some betel-nut and _kath_ (catechu) on one leaf, and some
  lime-paste on another, and roll them up; this is called _a berah.
  Some put camphor and musk into it_, and tie both leaves with a silk
  thread,” etc. (See _Blochmann’s Transl._ p. 73.) Finally one of the
  Chinese notices of Kamboja, translated by Abel Rémusat, says: “When
  a guest comes it is usual to present him with _areca, camphor, and
  other aromatics_.” (_Nouv. Mél._ I. 84.)

  NOTE 5.—This is the only passage of Ramusio’s version, so far as
  I know, that suggests interpolation from a recent author, as
  distinguished from mere editorial modification. There is in Barbosa
  a description of the _duello_ as practised in Canara, which is
  rather too like this one.

                             CHAPTER XXII.

                       OF THE KINGDOM OF COILUM.


When you quit Maabar and go 500 miles towards the south-west you come
to the kingdom of COILUM. The people are Idolaters, but there are also
some Christians and some Jews. The natives have a language of their
own, and a King of their own, and are tributary to no one.{1}

A great deal of brazil is got here which is called _brazil Coilumin_
from the country which produces it; ’tis of very fine quality.{2}
Good ginger also grows here, and it is known by the same name of
_Coilumin_ after the country.{3} Pepper too grows in great abundance
throughout this country, and I will tell you how. You must know that
the pepper-trees are (not wild but) cultivated, being regularly planted
and watered; and the pepper is gathered in the months of May, June,
and July. They have also abundance of very fine indigo. This is made
of a certain herb which is gathered, and [after the roots have been
removed] is put into great vessels upon which they pour water and then
leave it till the whole of the plant is decomposed. They then put this
liquid in the sun, which is tremendously hot there, so that it boils
and coagulates, and becomes such as we see it. [They then divide it
into pieces of four ounces each, and in that form it is exported to our
parts.]{4} And I assure you that the heat of the sun is so great there
that it is scarcely to be endured; in fact if you put an egg into one
of the rivers it will be boiled, before you have had time to go any
distance, by the mere heat of the sun!

The merchants from Manzi, and from Arabia, and from the Levant come
thither with their ships and their merchandise and make great profits
both by what they import and by what they export.

There are in this country many and divers beasts quite different from
those of other parts of the world. Thus there are lions black all over,
with no mixture of any other colour; and there are parrots of many
sorts, for some are white as snow with red beak and feet, and some are
red, and some are blue, forming the most charming sight in the world;
there are green ones too. There are also some parrots of exceeding
small size, beautiful creatures.{5} They have also very beautiful
peacocks, larger than ours, and different; and they have cocks and
hens quite different from ours; and what more shall I say? In short,
everything they have is different from ours, and finer and better.
Neither is their fruit like ours, nor their beasts, nor their birds;
and this difference all comes of the excessive heat.

Corn they have none but rice. So also their wine they make from
[palm-]sugar; capital drink it is, and very speedily it makes a man
drunk. All other necessaries of man’s life they have in great plenty
and cheapness. They have very good astrologers and physicians. Man and
woman, they are all black, and go naked, all save a fine cloth worn
about the middle. They look not on any sin of the flesh as a sin. They
marry their cousins german, and a man takes his brother’s wife after
the brother’s death; and all the people of India have this custom.{6}

There is no more to tell you there; so we will proceed, and I will tell
you of another country called Comari.


  NOTE 1.—Futile doubts were raised by Baldelli Boni and Hugh Murray
  as to the position of COILUM, because of Marco’s mentioning it
  before Comari or Cape Comorin; and they have insisted on finding
  a Coilum to the _east_ of that promontory. There is, however, in
  reality, no room for any question on this subject. For ages Coilum,
  Kaulam, or, as we now write it, Quilon, and properly Kollam, was
  one of the greatest ports of trade with Western Asia.[1] The
  earliest mention of it that I can indicate is in a letter written
  by the Nestorian Patriarch, Jesujabus of Adiabene, who died A.D.
  660, to Simon Metropolitan of Fars, blaming his neglect of duty,
  through which he says, not only is India, “which extends from
  the coast of the Kingdom of Fars to COLON, a distance of 1200
  parasangs, deprived of a regular ministry, but Fars itself is
  lying in darkness.” (_Assem._ III. pt. ii. 437.) The same place
  appears in the earlier part of the Arab _Relations_ (A.D. 851) as
  _Kaulam-Malé_, the port of India made by vessels from Maskat, and
  already frequented by great Chinese Junks.

  Abulfeda defines the position of Kaulam as at the extreme end of
  _Balad-ul-Falfal_, _i.e._ the Pepper country or Malabar, as you
  go eastward, standing on an inlet of the sea, in a sandy plain,
  adorned with many gardens. The brazil-tree grew there, and the
  Mahomedans had a fine mosque and square. Ibn Batuta also notices
  the fine mosque, and says the city was one of the finest in
  Malabar, with splendid markets and rich merchants, and was the
  chief resort of the Chinese traders in India. Odoric describes it
  as “at the extremity of the Pepper Forest towards the south,” and
  astonishing in the abundance of its merchandise. Friar Jordanus
  of Séverac was there as a missionary some time previous to 1328,
  in which year he was at home; [on the 21st of August, 1329, he]
  was nominated Bishop of the See of Kaulam, Latinised as _Columbum_
  or _Columbus_ [created by John XXII. on the 9th of August of the
  same year—H. C.]. Twenty years later John Marignolli visited “the
  very noble city of Columbum, where the whole world’s pepper is
  produced,” and found there a Latin church of St. George, probably
  founded by Jordanus.[2] Kaulam or Coilon continued to be an
  important place to the beginning of the 16th century, when Varthema
  speaks of it as a fine port, and Barbosa as “a very great city,”
  with a very good haven, and with many great merchants, Moors and
  Gentoos, whose ships traded to all the Eastern ports as far as
  Bengal, Pegu, and the Archipelago. But after this its decay must
  have been rapid, and in the following century it had sunk into
  entire insignificance. Throughout the Middle Ages it appears to
  have been one of the chief seats of the St. Thomas Christians.
  Indeed both it and Káyal were two out of the seven ancient churches
  which Indo-Syrian tradition ascribed to St. Thomas himself.[3]

  I have been desirous to give some illustration of the churches
  of that interesting body, certain of which must date from a very
  remote period, but I have found unlooked-for difficulties in
  procuring such illustration. Several are given in the Life of Dr.
  Claudius Buchanan from his own sketches, and a few others in the
  Life of Bishop D. Wilson. But nearly all represent the churches
  as they were perverted in the 17th century and since, by a coarse
  imitation of a style of architecture bad enough in its genuine
  form. I give, after Buchanan, the old church at Parúr, not far from
  Cranganore, which had escaped masquerade, with one from Bishop
  Wilson’s Life, showing the quasi-Jesuit deformation alluded to,
  and an interior also from the latter work, which appears to have
  some trace of genuine character. Parúr church is probably _Pálúr_,
  or _Pázhúr_, which is one of those ascribed to St. Thomas; for Dr.
  Buchanan says it bears the name of the Apostle, and “is supposed to
  be the oldest in Malabar.” (_Christ. Res._ p. 113.)

  _How_ Polo comes to mention Coilum before Comari is a question that
  will be treated further on, with other misplacements of like kind
  that occur in succeeding chapters.

  Kúblái had a good deal of diplomatic intercourse of his usual
  kind with Kaulam. De Mailla mentions the arrival at T’swan-chau
  (or Zayton) in 1282 of envoys from KIULAN, an Indian State,
  bringing presents of various rarities, including a black ape as
  big as a man. The Emperor had three times sent thither an officer
  called Yang Ting-pi (IX. 415). Some rather curious details of
  these missions are extracted by Pauthier from the Chinese Annals.
  The royal residence is in these called _A-pu-’hota_.[4] The king
  is styled _Pinati_. I may note that Barbosa also tells us that
  the King of Kaulam was called Benate-deri (_devar_?). And Dr.
  Caldwell’s kindness enables me to explain this title. _Pinati_
  or _Benate_ represents _Venáḍan_, “the Lord of the Venáḍu,” or
  _Venaṭṭu_, that being the name of the district to which belonged
  the family of the old kings of Kollam, and _Venáḍan_ being their
  regular dynastic name. The Rajas of Travancore who superseded the
  Kings of Kollam, and inherit their titles, are still poetically
  styled Venáḍan. (_Pauthier_, p. 603 _seqq._; _Ram._ I. f. 304.)

  NOTE 2.—The brazil-wood of Kaulam appears in the Commercial
  Handbook of Pegolotti (_circa_ 1340) as _Verzino Colombino_, and
  under the same name in that of Giov. d’Uzzano a century later.
  Pegolotti in one passage details kinds of brazil under the names
  of _Verzino salvatico_, _dimestico_, and _columbino_. In another
  passage, where he enters into particulars as to the respective
  values of different qualities, he names three kinds, as _Colomni_,
  _Ameri_, and _Seni_, of which the _Colomni_ (or Colombino) was
  worth a sixth more than the _Ameri_ and three times as much as
  the _Seni_. I have already conjectured that _Ameri_ may stand for
  _Lameri_ referring to Lambri in Sumatra (_supra_ ch. xi., note 1);
  and perhaps _Seni_ is _Sini_ or Chinese, indicating an article
  brought to India by the Chinese traders, probably from Siam.

  We have seen in the last note that the Kaulam brazil is spoken of
  by Abulfeda; and Ibn Batuta, in describing his voyage by the back
  waters from Calicut to Kaulam, says: “All the trees that grow by
  this river are either cinnamon or brazil trees. They use these
  for firewood, and we cooked with them throughout our journey.”
  Friar Odoric makes the same hyperbolic statement: “Here they burn
  brazil-wood for fuel.”

  It has been supposed popularly that the brazil-wood of commerce
  took its name from the great country so called; but the _verzino_
  of the old Italian writers is only a form of the same word, and
  _bresil_ is in fact the word used by Polo. So Chaucer:—

      “Him nedeth not his colour for to dien
       With _brazil_, ne with grain of Portingale.”
                                      —_The Nun’s Priest’s Tale_.

  The _Eastern_ wood in question is now known in commerce by its
  Malay name of _Sappan_ (properly _Sapang_), which again is
  identical with the Tamil name _Sappangi_. This word properly means
  _Japan_, and seems to have been given to the wood as a supposed
  product of that region.[5] It is the wood of the _Caesalpinia
  Sapan_, and is known in Arabic (and in Hindustani) as _Băḳăm_.
  It is a thorny tree, indigenous in Western India from Goa to
  Trevandrum, and growing luxuriantly in South Malabar. It is
  extensively used by native dyers, chiefly for common and cheap
  cloths, and for fine mats. The dye is precipitated dark-brown with
  iron, and red with alum. It is said, in Western India, to furnish
  the red powder thrown about on the Hindu feast of the _Húli_. The
  tree is both wild and cultivated, and is grown rather extensively
  by the Mahomedans of Malabar, called _Moplahs_ (_Mapillas_, see p.
  372), whose custom it is to plant a number of seeds at the birth of
  a daughter. The trees require fourteen or fifteen years to come to
  maturity, and then become the girl’s dowry.

  Though to a great extent superseded by the kindred wood from
  Pernambuco, the sappan is still a substantial object of importation
  into England. That American dye-stuff which _now_ bears the name
  of brazil-wood is believed to be the produce of at least two
  species of Caesalpinia, but the question seems to partake of the
  singular obscurity which hangs over the origin of so many useful
  drugs and dye-stuffs. The variety called _Braziletto_ is from _C.
  bahamensis_, a native of the Bahamas.

  The name of Brazil has had a curious history. Etymologists refer it
  to the colour of _braise_ or hot coals, and its first application
  was to this dye-wood from the far East. Then it was applied to a
  newly-discovered tract of South America, perhaps because producing
  a kindred dye-wood in large quantities: finally the original wood
  is robbed of its name, which is monopolised by that imported from
  the new country. The Region of Brazil had been originally styled
  _Santa Cruz_, and De Barros attributes the change of name to the
  suggestion of the Evil One, “as if the name of a wood for colouring
  cloth were of more moment than that of the Wood which imbues the
  Sacraments with the tincture of Salvation.”

  There may perhaps be a doubt if the Land of Brazil derived its
  name from the dye-wood. For the Isle of Brazil, long before the
  discovery of America, was a name applied to an imaginary Island
  in the Atlantic. This island appears in the map of Andrea Bianco
  and in many others, down at least to Coronelli’s splendid Venetian
  Atlas (1696); the Irish used to fancy that they could see it from
  the Isles of Arran; and the legend of this Island of Brazil still
  persisted among sailors in the last century.[6] The story was no
  doubt the same as that of the green Island, or Island of Youth,
  which Mr. Campbell tells us the Hebrideans see to the west of their
  own Islands. (See _Pop. Tales of West Highlands_, IV. 163. For
  previous references, _Della Decima_, III. 298, 361; IV. 60; _I. B._
  IV. 99; _Cathay_, p. 77; _Note by Dr. H. Gleghorn_; _Marsh’s ed. of
  Wedgwood’s Etym. Dict._ I. 123; _Southey, H. of Brazil_, I. 22.)

  NOTE 3.—This is the _Colombine_ ginger which appears not
  unfrequently in mediæval writings. Pegolotti tells us that
  “ginger is of several sorts, to wit, _Belledi_, _Colombino_,
  and _Mecchino_. And these names are bestowed from the producing
  countries, at least this is the case with the _Colombino_ and
  _Mecchino_, for the _Belledi_ is produced in many districts of
  India. The Colombino grows in the Island of Colombo of India, and
  has a smooth, delicate, ash-coloured rind; whilst the Mecchino
  comes from the districts about Mecca and is a small kind, hard
  to cut,” etc. (_Della Dec._ III. 359.) A century later, in G. da
  Uzzano, we still find the _Colombino_ and _Belladi_ ginger (IV.
  111, 210, etc.). The _Baladi_ is also mentioned by Rashiduddin
  as an export of Guzerat, and by Barbosa and others as one of
  Calicut in the beginning of the 16th century. The _Mecchino_ too
  is mentioned again in that era by a Venetian traveller as grown
  in the Island of Camran in the Red Sea. Both Columbine (_gigembre
  columbin_) and Baladi ginger (_gig. baladit_) appear among the
  purchases for King John of France, during his captivity in England.
  And we gather from his accounts that the price of the former was
  13_d._ a pound, and of the latter 12_d._, sums representing three
  times the amount of silver that they now indicate, with a higher
  value of silver also, and hence equivalent to about 4_s._ and 4_s._
  4_d._ a pound. The term _Baladi_ (Ar.), Indigenous or “Country”
  ginger, indicated ordinary qualities of no particular repute. The
  word _Baladi_ seems to have become naturalised in Spanish with the
  meaning “of small value.” We have noticed on a former occasion the
  decay of the demand for pepper in China. Ginger affords a similar
  example. This spice, so highly prized and so well known throughout
  Europe in the Middle Ages, I have found to be quite unknown by
  name and qualities to servants in Palermo of more than average
  intelligence. (_Elliot_, I. 67; _Ramusio_, I. f. 275, v. 323; _Dozy
  and Engelm._ pp. 232–233; _Douet d’Arcq_, p. 218; _Philobiblon Soc.
  Miscellanies_, vol. ii. p. 116.)

  NOTE 4.—In Bengal Indigo factories artificial heat is employed
  to promote the drying of the precipitated dye; but this is not
  essential to the manufacture. Marco’s account, though grotesque in
  its baldness, does describe the chief features of the manufacture
  of Indigo by fermentation. The branches are cut and placed stem
  upwards in the vat till it is three parts full; they are loaded,
  and then the vat is filled with water. Fermentation soon begins and
  goes on till in 24 hours _the contents of the vat are so hot that
  the hand cannot be retained in it_. This is what Marco ascribes to
  the sun’s heat. The liquor is then drawn off to another cistern
  and there agitated; the indigo separates in flakes. A quantity of
  lime-water then is added, and the blue is allowed to subside. The
  clear water is drawn off; the sediment is drained, pressed, and cut
  into small squares, etc. (See _Madras Journal_, vol. viii. 198.)

  Indigo had been introduced into Sicily by the Jews during the time
  of Frederick II., in the early part of Polo’s century. Jews and
  Indigo have long vanished from Sicily. The dye is often mentioned
  in Pegolotti’s Book; the finest quality being termed _Indaco
  Baccadeo_, a corruption of _Bághdádi_. Probably it came from India
  by way of Baghdad. In the Barcelona Tariffs it appears as Indigo de
  _Bagadel_. Another quality often mentioned is Indigo _di Golfo_.
  (See _Capmany, Memorias_, II. App. p. 73.) In the bye-laws of the
  London Painters’ Guild of the 13th century, quoted by Sir F.
  Palgrave from the _Liber Horne_, it is forbidden to paint on gold
  or silver except with fine (mineral) colours, “_e nient de_ brasil,
  _ne de_ inde de Baldas, _ne de nul autre mauveise couleur_.” (_The
  Merchant and the Friar_, p. xxiii.) There is now no indigo made
  or exported at Quilon, but there is still some feeble export of
  sappanwood, ginger, and pepper. These, and previous particulars
  as to the present Quilon, I owe to the kindness of Mr. Ballard,
  British Resident at Trevandrum.

  NOTE 5.—Black Tigers and black Leopards are not very rare in
  Travancore (See _Welsh’s Mil. Reminiscences_, II. 102.)

  NOTE 6.—Probably founded on local or caste customs of marriage,
  several of which in South India are very peculiar; _e.g._, see
  _Nelson’s Madura_, Pt. II. p. 51.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] The etymology of the name seems to be doubtful. Dr. Caldwell tells
    me it is an error to connect it (as in the first edition) with
    the word for a Tank, which is _Kuḷam_. The apparent meaning of
    _Kollam_ is “slaughter,” but he thinks the name is best explained
    as “Palace” or “Royal Residence.”

[2] There is still a _Syrian_ church of St. George at Quilon, and
    a mosque of some importance;—the representatives at least of
    those noted above, though no actual trace of antiquity of any
    kind remains at the place. A vague tradition of extensive trade
    with China yet survives. The form _Columbum_ is accounted for
    by an inscription, published by the Prince of Travancore (_Ind.
    Antiq._ II. 360), which shows that the city was called in Sanskrit
    _Kolamba_. May not the real etymology be Sansk. _Kolam_, “Black
    Pepper”?

    On the suggestion ventured in this note Dr. Caldwell writes:

    “I fancy _Kôla_, a name for pepper in Sanskrit, may be derived from
    the name of the country _Kôlam_, North Malabar, which is much more
    celebrated for its pepper than the country around Quilon. This
    _Kôlam_, though resembling _Kollam_, is really a separate word,
    and never confounded with the latter by the natives. The prince
    of Kôlam (North Malabar) is called _Kolastri_ or _Kolattiri_[A].
    Compare also _Kôlagiri_, the name of a hill in the Sanskrit
    dictionaries, called also the _Kôlla giri_. The only possible
    derivations for the Tamil and Malayalim name of Quilon that I am
    acquainted with are these: (1.) From _Kolu_, the ‘Royal Presence’
    or presence-chamber, or hall of audience. _Kollam_ might naturally
    be a derivation of this word; and in confirmation I find that
    other residences of Malabar kings were also called Kollam, _e.g._
    Kodungalur or Cranganore. (2.) From _Kolu_, the same word, but with
    the meaning ‘a height’ or ‘high-ground.’ Hence _Kollei_, a very
    common word in Tamil for a ‘dry grain field, a back-yard.’ _Kolli_
    is also, in the Tamil poets, said to be the name of a hill in the
    Chera country, _i.e._ the Malabar coast. _Kôlam_ in Tamil has not
    the meaning of pepper; it means ‘beauty,’ and it is said also to
    mean the fruit of the jujuba. (3.) It might possibly be derived
    from _Kol_, to slay;—_Kollam_, slaughter, or a place where some
    slaughter happened ... in the absence, however, of any tradition to
    this effect, this derivation seems improbable.”

[3] Burnell.

[4] The translated passage about _’Apuhota_ is a little obscure. The
    name looks like _Kapukada_, which was the site of a palace north of
    _Calicut_ (not in Kaulam), the _Capucate_ of the Portuguese.

[5] _Dr. Caldwell_.

[6] Indeed, Humboldt speaks of Brazil Isle as appearing to the west of
    Ireland in a modern English map—_Purdy’s_; but I do not know its
    date. (See _Examen_, etc., II. 244–245.)

                     OF THE COUNTRY CALLED COMARI.


Comari is a country belonging to India, and there you can see something
of the North Star, which we had not been able to see from the Lesser
Java thus far. In order to see it you must go some 30 miles out to sea,
and then you see it about a cubit above the water.{1}

This is a very wild country, and there are beasts of all kinds there,
especially monkeys of such peculiar fashion that you would take them
for men! There are also _gatpauls_{2} in wonderful diversity, with
bears, lions, and leopards, in abundance.


  NOTE 1.—_Kumári_ is in some versions of the Hindu cosmography the
  most southerly of the nine divisions of Jambodvipa, the Indian
  world. Polo’s Comari can only be the country about Cape COMORIN,
  the κομάρια ἄκρον of Ptolemy, a name derived from the Sanskrit
  _Kumári_, “a Virgin,” an appellation of the goddess Durgá. The
  monthly bathing in her honour, spoken of by the author of the
  _Periplus_, is still continued, though now the pilgrims are few.
  Abulfeda speaks of _Rás Kumhări_ as the limit between Malabar and
  Ma’bar. _Kumări_ is the Tamul pronunciation of the Sanskrit word
  and probably _Comări_ was Polo’s pronunciation.

  At the beginning of the Portuguese era in India we hear of a small
  Kingdom of COMORI, the prince of which had succeeded to the kingdom
  of Kaulam. And this, as Dr. Caldwell points out, must have been the
  state which is now called Travancore. Kumari has been confounded by
  some of the Arabian Geographers, or their modern commentators, with
  _Kumár_, one of the regions supplying aloes-wood, and which was
  apparently _Khmer_ or Kamboja. (_Caldwell’s Drav. Grammar_, p. 67;
  _Gildem._ 185; _Ram._ I. 333.)

  The cut that we give is, as far as I know, the first genuine view
  of Cape Comorin ever published.

  [Mr. Talboys Wheeler, in his _History of India_, vol. iii. (p.
  386), says of this tract:

  “The region derives its name from a temple which was erected there
  in honour of Kumárí, ‘the Virgin’; the infant babe who had been
  exchanged for Krishna, and ascended to heaven at the approach of
  Kansa.” And in a note:

  “Colonel Yule identifies Kumárí with Durgá. This is an error. The
  temple of Kumárí was erected by Krishna Raja of Narsinga, a zealous
  patron of the Vaishnavas.”

  Mr. Wheeler quotes Faria y Souza, who refers the object of worship
  to what is meant for this story (II. 394), but I presume from Mr.
  Wheeler’s mention of the builder of the temple, which does not
  occur in the Portuguese history, that he has other information.
  The application of the Virgin title connected with the name of
  the place, may probably have varied with the ages, and, as there
  is no time to obtain other evidence, I have removed the words
  which identified the _existing temple_ with that of Durgá. But
  my authority for identifying the _object of worship_, in whose
  honour the pilgrims bathe monthly at Cape Comorin, with Durgá, is
  the excellent one of Dr. Caldwell. (See his _Dravidian Grammar_
  as quoted in the passage above.) Krishna Raja of whom Mr. Wheeler
  speaks, reigned after the Portuguese were established in India, but
  it is not probable that the Krishna stories of that class were even
  known in the Peninsula (or perhaps anywhere else) in the time of
  the author of the _Periplus_, 1450 years before; and ’tis as little
  likely that the locality owed its name to Yasoda’s Infant, as that
  it owed it to the Madonna in St. Francis Xavier’s Church that
  overlooks the Cape.

  Fra Paolino, in his unsatisfactory way (_Viaggio_, p. 68), speaks
  of Cape Comorin, “which the Indians call _Canyamuri_, _Virginis
  Promontorium_, or simply _Comarí_ or _Cumarí_ ‘a Virgin,’ because
  they pretend that anciently the goddess _Comari_ ‘the Damsel,’ who
  is the Indian Diana or Hecate, used to bathe” etc. However, we can
  discover from his book elsewhere (see pp. 79, 285) that by the
  Indian Diana he means Párvatí, _i.e._ Durgá.

  Lassen at first[1] identified the Kumárí of the Cape with Párvatí;
  but afterwards connected the name with a story in the Mahábhárata
  about certain _Apsarases_ changed into Crocodiles.[2] On the whole
  there does not seem sufficient ground to deny that Párvatí was the
  _original_ object of worship at Kumárí, though the name may have
  lent itself to various legends.]

    Geological Survey of India.)]

  NOTE 2.—I have not been able to ascertain with any precision what
  animal is meant by _Gat-paul_. The term occurs again, coupled with
  monkeys as here, at p. 240 of the Geog. Text, where, speaking of
  Abyssinia, it is said: “_Il ont_ gat paulz _et autre gat-maimon
  si divisez_,” etc. _Gatto maimone_, for an ape of some kind, is
  common in old Italian, the latter part of the term, from the Pers.
  _Maimún_, being possibly connected with our _Baboon_. And that the
  _Gat-paul_ was also some kind of ape is confirmed by the Spanish
  Dictionaries. Cobarrubias gives: “_Gato-Paus_, a kind of tailed
  monkey. _Gato-paus, Gato pablo_; perhaps as they call a monkey
  ‘Martha,’ they may have called this particular monkey ‘Paul,’” etc.
  (f. 431 v.). So also the _Diccion. de la Lengua Castellana comp.
  por la Real Academia_ (1783) gives: “_Gato Paul_, a kind of monkey
  of a grey colour, black muzzle and very broad tail.” In fact, the
  word is used by Columbus, who, in his own account of his third
  voyage, describes a hill on the coast of Paria as covered with a
  species of _Gatos Paulos_. (See _Navarrete_, Fr. ed. III. 21, also
  147–148.) It also occurs in _Marmol, Desc. General de Affrica_,
  who says that one kind of monkeys has a black face; “_y estas
  comunemente se llaman en España_ Gatos Paules, _las quales se crian
  en la tierra de los Negros_” (I. f. 27). It is worth noting that
  the revisers of the text adopted by Pauthier have not understood
  the word. For they substitute for the “_Il hi a_ gat paul _si
  divisez qe ce estoit mervoille_” of the Geog. Text, “_et si a moult
  de_ granz paluz _et moult grans pantains à merveilles_”—wonderful
  swamps and marshes! The Pipino Latin has adhered to the correct
  reading—“_Ibi sunt_ cati qui dicuntur pauli, _valde diversi ab
  aliis_.”

                             CHAPTER XXIV.

                    CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF ELI.


Eli is a kingdom towards the west, about 300 miles from Comari. The
people are Idolaters and have a king, and are tributary to nobody; and
have a peculiar language. We will tell you particulars about their
manners and their products, and you will better understand things now
because we are drawing near to places that are not so outlandish.{1}

There is no proper harbour in the country, but there are many great
rivers with good estuaries, wide and deep.{2} Pepper and ginger grow
there, and other spices in quantities.{3} The King is rich in treasure,
but not very strong in forces. The approach to his kingdom however is
so strong by nature that no one can attack him, so he is afraid of
nobody.

And you must know that if any ship enters their estuary and anchors
there, having been bound for some other port, they seize her and
plunder the cargo. For they say, “You were bound for somewhere else,
and ’tis God has sent you hither to us, so we have a right to all your
goods.” And they think it no sin to act thus. And this naughty custom
prevails all over these provinces of India, to wit, that if a ship be
driven by stress of weather into some other port than that to which
it was bound, it is sure to be plundered. But if a ship come bound
originally to the place they receive it with all honour and give it due
protection.{4} The ships of Manzi and other countries that come hither
in summer lay in their cargoes in 6 or 8 days and depart as fast as
possible, because there is no harbour other than the river-mouth, a
mere roadstead and sandbanks, so that it is perilous to tarry there.
The ships of Manzi indeed are not so much afraid of these roadsteads as
others are, because they have such huge wooden anchors which hold in
all weather.{5}

There are many lions and other wild beasts here and plenty of game,
both beast and bird.


  NOTE 1.—No city or district is now known by the name of ELY, but
  the name survives in that of Mount _Dely_, properly Monte d’ELY,
  the _Yeli-mala_ of the Malabar people, and called also in the
  legends of the coast _Sapta-shaila_, or the Seven Hills. This is
  the only spur of the Gháts that reaches the sea within the Madras
  territory. It is an isolated and very conspicuous hill, or cluster
  of hills, forming a promontory some 16 miles north of Cananore, the
  first Indian land seen by Vasco da Gama, on that memorable August
  morning in 1498, and formerly very well known to navigators, though
  it has been allowed to drop out of some of our most ambitious
  modern maps. Abulfeda describes it as “a great mountain projecting
  into the sea, and descried from a great distance, called _Ras
  Haili_”; and it appears in Fra Mauro’s map as _Cavo de Eli_.

  Rashiduddin mentions “the country of Hili,” between _Manjarúr_
  (Mangalore) and Fandaraina (miswritten in Elliot’s copy _Sadarsa_).
  Ibn Batuta speaks of Hili, which he reached on leaving Manjarúr,
  as “a great and well-built city, situated on a large estuary
  accessible to great ships. The vessels of China come hither; this,
  Kaulam, and Kalikut, are the only ports that they enter.” From
  Hili he proceeds 12 miles further down the coast to _Jor-fattan_,
  which probably corresponds to Baliapatan. ELLY appears in the
  Carta Catalana, and is marked as a Christian city. Nicolo Conti
  is the last to speak distinctly of the city. Sailing from Cambay,
  in 20 days he arrived at two cities on the sea-shore, _Pacamuria_
  (_Faknúr_, of Rashid and Firishta, _Baccanor_ of old books, and
  now _Bárkúr_, the Malayálim _Vákkanúr_) and HELLI. But we read
  that in 1527 Simon de Melo was sent to burn ships in the River of
  _Marabia_ and at _Monte d’Elli_.[1] When Da Gama on his second
  voyage was on his way from Baticala (in Canara) to Cananor, a
  squall having sprung his mainmast just before reaching Mt. d’Ely,
  “the captain-major anchored in the Bay of Marabia, because he saw
  there several Moorish ships, in order to get a mast from them.” It
  seems clear that this was the bay just behind Mt. d’Ely.

  Indeed the name of Marabia or _Máráwí_ is still preserved in
  _Mádávi_ or Mádái, corruptly termed _Maudoy_ in some of our maps,
  a township upon the river which enters the bay about 7 or 8 miles
  south-east of Mt. d’Ely, and which is called by De Barros the
  _Rio Marabia_. Mr. Ballard informs me that he never heard of
  ruins of importance at Madai, but there is a place on the river
  just mentioned, and within the Madai township, called _Payangádi_
  (“Old Town”), which has the remains of an old fort of the Kolastri
  (or Kolatiri) Rajas. A _palace_ at Madai (perhaps this fort) is
  alluded to by Dr. Gundert in the _Madras Journal_, and a Buddhist
  Vihara is spoken of in an old Malayalim poem as having existed
  at the same place. The same paper speaks of “the famous emporium
  of Cachilpatnam near Mt. d’Ely,” which may have been our city of
  Hili, as the cities Hili and Marawi were apparently separate though
  near.[2]

  [Illustration: Mount d’Ely, from the Sea, in last century.]

  The state of _Hílí-Máráwi_ is also mentioned in the Arabic
  work on the early history of the Mahomedans in Malabar, called
  _Tuhfat-al-Mujáhidín_, and translated by Rowlandson; and as the
  Prince is there called _Kolturee_, this would seem to identify him
  either in family or person with the Raja of Cananor, for that old
  dynasty always bore the name of _Kolatiri_.[3]

  The Ramusian version of Barbosa is very defective here, but in
  Stanley’s version (Hak. Soc. _East African and Malabar Coasts_,
  p. 149) we find the topography in a passage from a Munich MS.
  clear enough: “After passing this place” (the river of Nirapura or
  Nileshwaram) “along the coast is the mountain Dely (of Ely) on the
  edge of the sea; it is a round mountain, very lofty, in the midst
  of low land; all the ships of the Moors and Gentiles that navigate
  in this sea of India sight this mountain when coming from without,
  and make their reckoning by it; ... after this, at the foot of the
  mountain to the south, is a town called _Marave_, very ancient and
  well off, in which live Moors and Gentiles and Jews; these Jews are
  of the language of the country; it is a long time that they have
  dwelt in this place.”

  NOTE 2.—This is from Pauthier’s text, and the map with ch. xxi.
  illustrates the fact of the many wide rivers. The G. T. has “a good
  river with a very good estuary” or mouth. The latter word is in the
  G. T. _faces_, afterwards more correctly _foces_, equivalent to
  _fauces_. We have seen that Ibn Batuta also speaks of the estuary
  or inlet at Hili. It may have been either that immediately east of
  Mount d’Ely, communicating with Kavváyi and the Nileshwaram River,
  or the Madai River. Neither could be entered by vessels now, but
  there have been great littoral changes. The land joining Mt. d’Ely
  to the main is mere alluvium.

  NOTE 3.—Barbosa says that throughout the kingdom of Cananor the
  pepper was of excellent quality, though not in great quantity.
  There was much ginger, not first-rate, which was called _Hely_ from
  its growing about Mount d’Ely, with cardamoms (names of which,
  _Elá_ in Sanskrit, _Hel_ in Persian, I have thought might be connected
  with that of the hill), mirobolans, cassia fistula, zerumbet, and
  zedoary. The two last items are two species of _curcuma_, formerly
  in much demand as aromatics; the last is, I believe, the _setewale_
  of Chaucer:—

      “There was eke wexing many a spice,
       As clowe gilofre and Licorice,
         Ginger and grein de Paradis,
       Canell and setewale of pris,
       And many a spice delitable
       To eaten when men rise from table.”—_R. of the Rose_.

  The Hely ginger is also mentioned by Conti.

  NOTE 4.—This piratical practice is noted by Abdurrazzák also: “In
  other parts (than Calicut) a strange practice is adopted. When
  a vessel sets sail for a certain point, and suddenly is driven
  by a decree of Divine Providence into another roadstead, the
  inhabitants, under the pretext that the wind has driven it thither,
  plunder the ship. But at Calicut every ship, whatever place it
  comes from, or wherever it may be bound, when it puts into this
  port, is treated like other vessels, and has no trouble of any kind
  to put up with” (p. 14). In 1673 Sivaji replied to the pleadings
  of an English embassy, that it was “against the Laws of Conchon”
  (Ptolemy’s _Pirate Coast_!) “to restore any ships or goods that
  were driven ashore.” (_Fryer_, p. 261.)

  NOTE 5.—With regard to the anchors, Pauthier’s text has just the
  opposite of the G. T. which we have preferred: “_Les nefs du Manzi
  portent si grans ancres de fust_, que il seuffrent moult _de grans
  fortunes aus plajes_.” De Mailla says the Chinese consider their
  ironwood anchors to be much better than those of iron, because the
  latter are subject to strain. (_Lett. Edif._ XIV. 10.) Capt. Owen
  has a good word for wooden anchors. (_Narr. of Voyages, etc._, I.
  385.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] The Town of Monte d’Ely appears (_Monte Dil_) in Coronelli’s Atlas
    (1690) from some older source. Mr. Burnell thinks Baliapatan
    (properly _Vaḷarpaṭṭanam_) which is still a prosperous Máppila
    town, on a broad and deep river, must be Hili. I see a little
    difficulty in this. [Marabia at Monte Dely is often mentioned in
    _Correa_, as one of the ports of the Kingdom of Cananor.]

[2] Mr. Burnell thinks _Kachchil_paṭṭanam must be an error (easy in
    Malayálim) for _Kavvil_paṭṭanam, _i.e._ Kavváyi (Kanwai in our map).

[3] As _printed_ by Rowlandson, the name is corrupt (like many others
    in the book), being given as _Hubaee Murawee_. But suspecting what
    this pointed to, I examined the MS. in the R. A. Society’s Library.
    The knowledge of the Arabic _character_ was quite sufficient to
    enable me to trace the name as هيلي ماراوي, _Hílí Máráwi_. (See
    _Rowlandson_, pp. 54, 58–59, and MS. pp. 23 and 26; also _Indian
    Antiquary_, III. p. 213.)




                             CHAPTER XXV.

                  CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF MELIBAR.


Melibar is a great kingdom lying towards the west. The people are
Idolaters; they have a language of their own, and a king of their own,
and pay tribute to nobody.{1}

In this country you see more of the North Star, for it shows two cubits
above the water. And you must know that from this kingdom of Melibar,
and from another near it called Gozurat, there go forth every year more
than a hundred corsair vessels on cruize. These pirates take with them
their wives and children, and stay out the whole summer. Their method
is to join in fleets of 20 or 30 of these pirate vessels together, and
then they form what they call a sea cordon,{2} that is, they drop off
till there is an interval of 5 or 6 miles between ship and ship, so
that they cover something like an hundred miles of sea, and no merchant
ship can escape them. For when any one corsair sights a vessel a signal
is made by fire or smoke, and then the whole of them make for this, and
seize the merchants and plunder them. After they have plundered them
they let them go, saying: “Go along with you and get more gain, and
that mayhap will fall to us also!” But now the merchants are aware of
this, and go so well manned and armed, and with such great ships, that
they don’t fear the corsairs. Still mishaps do befall them at times.{3}

There is in this kingdom a great quantity of pepper, and ginger, and
cinnamon, and turbit, and of nuts of India.{4} They also manufacture
very delicate and beautiful buckrams. The ships that come from the
east bring copper in ballast. They also bring hither cloths of silk
and gold, and sendels; also gold and silver, cloves and spikenard, and
other fine spices for which there is a demand here, and exchange them
for the products of these countries.

Ships come hither from many quarters, but especially from the great
province of Manzi.{5} Coarse spices are exported hence both to Manzi
and to the west, and that which is carried by the merchants to Aden
goes on to Alexandria, but the ships that go in the latter direction
are not one to ten of those that go to the eastward; a very notable
fact that I have mentioned before.

Now I have told you about the kingdom of Melibar; we shall now proceed
and tell you of the kingdom of Gozurat. And you must understand that
in speaking of these kingdoms we note only the capitals; there are
great numbers of other cities and towns of which we shall say nothing,
because it would make too long a story to speak of all.


  NOTE 1.—Here is another instance of that confusion which dislocates
  Polo’s descriptions of the Indian coast; we shall recur to it under
  ch. xxx.

  Malabar is a name given by the Arabs, and varies in its form:
  Ibn Batuta and Kazwini write it المليبار, _al-Malíbár_, Edrisi
  and Abulfeda المنيبار, _al-Maníbár_, etc., and like variations
  occur among the old European travellers. The country so-called
  corresponded to the _Kerala_ of the Brahmans, which in its very
  widest sense extended from about lat. 15° to Cape Comorin. This,
  too, seems to be the extension which Abulfeda gives to Malabar,
  viz., from Hunáwar to Kumhári; Rashiduddin includes Sindábúr,
  _i.e._ Goa. But at a later date a point between Mt. d’Ely and
  Mangalore on the north, and Kaulam on the south, were the limits
  usually assigned to Malabar.

  NOTE 2.—“_Il font_ eschiel _en la mer_” (G. T.). _Eschiel_ is
  the equivalent of the Italian _schera_ or _schiera_, a troop or
  squadron, and thence applied to order of battle, whether by land or
  sea.

  NOTE 3.—The northern part of Malabar, Canara, and the Konkan, have
  been nests of pirates from the time of the ancients to a very
  recent date. Padre Paolino specifies the vicinity of Mt. d’Ely as a
  special haunt of them in his day, the latter half of last century.
  Somewhat further north Ibn Batuta fell into their hands, and was
  stripped to his drawers.

  NOTE 4.—There is something to be said about these Malabar spices.
  The cinnamon of Malabar is what we call cassia, the _canella
  grossa_ of Conti, the _canela brava_ of the Portuguese. Notices
  of it will be found in _Rheede_ (I. 107) and in _Garcia_ (f.
  26 _seqq._). The latter says the Ceylon cinnamon exceeded it in
  value as 4:1. Uzzano discriminates _canella_ lunga, _Salami_, and
  _Mabari_. The _Salami_, I have no doubt, is _Sailani_, Ceylonese;
  and as we do not hear of any cassia from Mabar, probably the last
  was _Malabar_ cinnamon.

  _Turbit: Radex Turpethi_ is still known in pharmacy, at least
  in some parts of the Continent and in India, though in England
  obsolete. It is mentioned in the _Pharmacopœia of India_ (1868) as
  derived from _Ipomœa Turpethum_.

  But it is worthy of note that Ramusio has _cubebs_ instead of
  _turbit_. The former does not seem now to be a product of Western
  India, though Garcia says that a small quantity grew there, and
  a Dutch report of 1675 in Valentyn also mentions it as an export
  of Malabar. (_V., Ceylon_, p. 243.) There is some ambiguity in
  statements about it, because its popular name _Kábab-chíní_ seems
  to be also applied to the cassia bud. Cubeb pepper was much used in
  the Middle Ages as a spice, and imported into Europe as such. But
  the importation had long practically ceased, when its medical uses
  became known during the British occupation of Java, and the demand
  was renewed.

  Budaeus and Salmasius have identified this drug with the
  κώμακον, which Theophrastus joins with cinnamomum and cassia as
  an ingredient in aromatic confections. The inducement to this
  identification was no doubt the singular resemblance which the word
  bears to the Javanese name of cubeb pepper, viz., _Kumukus_. If
  the foundation were a little firmer this would be curious evidence
  of intercourse and trade with Java in a time earlier than that of
  Theophrastus, viz., the 4th century B.C.

  In the detail of 3 cargoes from Malabar that arrived at Lisbon in
  September 1504 we find the following proportions: Pepper, 10,000
  _cantars_; cinnamon, 500; cloves, 450; zz. (_i.e._ _zenzaro_,
  ginger), 130; lac and brazil, 750; camphor, 7; cubebs, 191; mace,
  2½; spikenard, 3; lign-aloes, 1⅓.

  Ital. version, 1576, f. 39–40; _Salmas. Exerc. Plin._ p. 923; _Bud.
  on Theoph._ 1004 and 1010; _Archiv. St. Ital._, Append. II. p. 19.)

  NOTE 5.—We see that Marco speaks of the merchants and ships of
  Manzi, or Southern China, as frequenting Kaulam, Hili, and now
  Malabar, of which Calicut was the chief port. This quite coincides
  with Ibn Batuta, who says those were the three ports of India which
  the Chinese junks frequented, adding Fandaraina (_i.e._ Pandarani,
  or Pantaláni, 16 miles north of Calicut), as a port where they
  used to moor for the winter when they spent that season in India.
  By the winter he means the rainy season, as Portuguese writers
  on India do by the same expression (IV. 81, 88, 96). I have been
  unable to find anything definite as to the date of the cessation
  of this Chinese navigation to Malabar, but I believe it may be
  placed about the beginning of the 15th century. The most distinct
  allusion to it that I am aware of is in the information of Joseph
  of Cranganore, in the _Novus Orbis_ (Ed. of 1555, p. 208). He says:
  “These people of Cathay are men of remarkable energy, and formerly
  drove a first-rate trade at the city of Calicut. But the King of
  Calicut having treated them badly, they quitted that city, and
  returning shortly after inflicted no small slaughter on the people
  of Calicut, and after that returned no more. After that they began
  to frequent Mailapetam, a city subject to the king of Narsingha; a
  region towards the East, ... and there they now drive their trade.”
  There is also in Gaspar Correa’s account of the Voyages of Da Gama
  a curious record of a tradition of the arrival in Malabar more than
  four centuries before of a vast merchant fleet “from the parts
  of Malacca, and China, and the Lequeos” (Lewchew); many from the
  company on board had settled in the country and left descendants.
  In the space of a hundred years none of these remained; but their
  sumptuous idol temples were still to be seen. (_Stanley’s Transl.,
  Hak. Soc._, p. 147.)[1] It is probable that both these stories
  must be referred to those extensive expeditions to the western
  countries with the object of restoring Chinese influence which
  were despatched by the Ming Emperor Ch’êng-Tsu (or Yung-lo), about
  1406, and one of which seems actually to have brought _Ceylon_
  under a partial subjection to China, which endured half a century.
  (See _Tennent_, I. 623 _seqq._; and _Letter of P. Gaubil_ in _J.
  A._ sér. II. tom. x. pp. 327–328.) [“So that at this day there is
  great memory of them in the ilands Philippinas, and on the cost
  of Coromande, which is the cost against the kingdome of Norsinga
  towards the sea of Cengala: whereas is a towne called unto this
  day the soile of the Chinos, for that they did reedifie and make
  the same. The like notice and memory is there in the kingdom of
  Calicut, whereas be many trees and fruits, that the naturals of
  that countrie do say, were brought thither by the Chinos, when
  that they were lords and gouernours of that countrie.” (_Mendoza,
  Parke’s transl._ p. 71.)] De Barros says that the famous city of
  Diu was built by one of the Kings of Guzerat whom he calls in
  one place _Dariar Khan_, and in another _Peruxiah_, in memory of
  victory in a sea-fight with the Chinese who then frequented the
  Indian shores. It is difficult to identify this King, though he is
  represented as the father of the famous toxicophagous Sultan Mahmúd
  Begara (1459–1511). De Barros has many other allusions to Chinese
  settlements and conquests in India which it is not very easy to
  account for. Whatever basis of facts there is must probably refer
  to the expeditions of Ch’êng-Tsu, but not a little probably grew
  out of the confusion of _Jainas_ and _Chinas_ already alluded to;
  and to this I incline to refer Correa’s “sumptuous idol-temples.”

  There must have been some revival of Chinese trade in the last
  century, if P. Paolino is correct in speaking of Chinese vessels
  frequenting Travancore ports for pepper. (_De Barros_, Dec. II.
  Liv. ii. cap. 9, and Dec. IV. Liv. v. cap. 3; _Paolino_, p. 74.)

[1] It appears from a paper in the Mackenzie MSS. that down to Colonel
    Mackenzie’s time there was a tribe in Calicut whose ancestors were
    believed to have been Chinese. (See _Taylor’s Catal. Raisonné_,
    III. 664.) And there is a notable passage in Abdurrazzák which
    says the seafaring population of Calicut were nicknamed _Chíní
    bachagán_, “China boys.” (_India in XVth Cent._ p. 19.)




                             CHAPTER XXVI.

                  CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF GOZURAT.


Gozurat is a great kingdom. The people are Idolaters and have a
peculiar language, and a king of their own, and are tributary to no
one. It lies towards the west, and the North Star is here still more
conspicuous, showing itself at an altitude of about 6 cubits.{1}

The people are the most desperate pirates in existence, and one
of their atrocious practices is this. When they have taken a
merchant-vessel they force the merchants to swallow a stuff called
_Tamarindi_ mixed in sea-water, which produces a violent purging.{2}
This is done in case the merchants, on seeing their danger, should have
swallowed their most valuable stones and pearls. And in this way the
pirates secure the whole.

In this province of Gozurat there grows much pepper, and ginger, and
indigo. They have also a great deal of cotton. Their cotton trees are
of very great size, growing full six paces high, and attaining to an
age of 20 years. It is to be observed however that, when the trees
are so old as that, the cotton is not good to spin, but only to quilt
or stuff beds withal. Up to the age of 12 years indeed the trees give
good spinning cotton, but from that age to 20 years the produce is
inferior.{3}

[Illustration: Mediæval Architecture in Guzerat. (From Fergusson.)]

They dress in this country great numbers of skins of various kinds,
goat-skins, ox-skins, buffalo and wild ox-skins, as well as those of
unicorns and other animals. In fact so many are dressed every year as
to load a number of ships for Arabia and other quarters. They also work
here beautiful mats in red and blue leather, exquisitely inlaid with
figures of birds and beasts, and skilfully embroidered with gold and
silver wire. These are marvellously beautiful things; they are used by
the Saracens to sleep upon, and capital they are for that purpose. They
also work cushions embroidered with gold, so fine that they are worth
six marks of silver a piece, whilst some of those sleeping-mats are
worth ten marks.{4}


  NOTE 1.—Again we note the topographical confusion. Guzerat is
  mentioned as if it were a province adjoining Malabar, and before
  arriving at Tana, Cambay, and Somnath; though in fact it includes
  those three cities, and Cambay was then its great mart. Wassáf,
  Polo’s contemporary, perhaps acquaintance, speaks of Gujarat which
  is commonly called Kambáyat. (_Elliot_, III. 31.)

  NOTE 2.—[“The origin of the name [_Tamarina_] is curious. It is Ar.
  _tamar-u’l-Hind_, ‘date of India,’ or perhaps rather, in Persian
  form, _tamar-i-Hindī_. It is possible that the original name may
  have been _thamar_, (‘fruit’) of India, rather than _tamar_,
  (‘date’).” (_Hobson-Jobson_.)]

  NOTE 3.—The notice of pepper here is hard to explain. But Hiuen
  Tsang also speaks of Indian pepper and incense (see next chapter)
  as grown at _’Ochali_ which seems to be some place on the northern
  border of Guzerat (II. 161).

  Marsden, in regard to the cotton, supposes here some confused
  introduction of the silk-cotton tree (_Bombax_ or _Salmalia_,
  the Semal of Hindustan), but the description would be entirely
  inapplicable to that great forest tree. It is remarkable that
  nearly the same statement with regard to Guzerat occurs in
  Rashiduddin’s sketch of India, as translated in Sir H. Elliot’s
  _History of India_ (_ed. by Professor Dowson_, I. 67): “Grapes
  are produced twice during the year, and the strength of the soil
  is such that cotton-plants grow like willows and plane-trees, and
  yield produce ten years running.” An author of later date, from
  whom extracts are given in the same work, viz., Mahommed Masúm in
  his _History of Sind_, describing the wonders of Síwí, says: “In
  Korzamin and Chhatur, which are districts of Siwi, cotton-plants
  grow as large as trees, insomuch that men pick the cotton mounted”
  (p. 237).

  These would appear to have been plants of the species of true
  cotton called by Royle _Gossipium arboreum_, and sometimes termed
  _G. religiosum_, from its being often grown in South India near
  temples or abodes of devotees; though the latter name has been
  applied also to the nankeen cotton. That of which we speak is,
  however, according to Dr. Cleghorn, termed in Mysore _Deo kapás_,
  of which _G. religiosum_ would be a proper translation. It is
  grown in various parts of India, but generally rather for ornament
  than use. It is stated, however, to be specially used for the
  manufacture of turbans, and for the Brahmanical thread, and
  probably afforded the groundwork of the story told by Philostratus
  of the _wild_ cotton which was used only for the sacred vestments
  of the Brahmans, and refused to lend itself to other uses. One of
  Royle’s authorities (Mr. Vaupell) mentions that it was grown near
  large towns of Eastern Guzerat, and its wool regarded as the finest
  of any, and only used in delicate muslins. Tod speaks of it in
  Bikanír, and this kind of cotton appears to be grown also in China,
  as we gather from a passage in _Amyot’s Mémoires_ (II. 606), which
  speaks of the “Cotonniers arbres, qui ne devoient être fertiles
  qu’après un bon nombre d’années.”

  The height appears to have been a difficulty with Marsden, who
  refers to the _G. arboreum_, but does not admit that it could be
  intended. Yet I see in the _English Cyclopædia_ that to this
  species is assigned a height of 15 to 20 feet. Polo’s six paces
  therefore, even if it means 30 feet as I think, is not a great
  exaggeration. (_Royle, Cult. of Cotton_, 144, 145, 152; _Eng.
  Cycl._ art. _Gossypium_.)

  NOTE 4.—Embroidered and Inlaid leather-work for bed-covers,
  palankin mats and the like, is still a great manufacture in Rajkot
  and other places of Kattiawár in Peninsular Guzerat, as well as in
  the adjoining region of Sind. (Note from _Sir Bartle Frere_.) The
  _embroidery_ of Guzerat is highly commended by Barbosa, Linschoten,
  and A. Hamilton.

  The G. T. adds at the end of this passage: “E qe voz en diroi?
  Sachíés tout voiremant qe en ceste reingne se labore _roiaus
  dereusse_ de cuir et plus sotilment que ne fait en tout lo monde, e
  celz qe sunt de greingnors vailance.”

  The two words in Roman type I cannot explain; qu. _royaux devises_?




                            CHAPTER XXVII.

                    CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF TANA.


Tana is a great kingdom lying towards the west, a kingdom great both in
size and worth. The people are Idolaters, with a language of their own,
and a king of their own, and tributary to nobody.{1} No pepper grows
there, nor other spices, but plenty of incense; not the white kind
however, but brown.{2}

There is much traffic here, and many ships and merchants frequent the
place; for there is a great export of leather of various excellent
kinds, and also of good buckram and cotton. The merchants in their
ships also import various articles, such as gold, silver, copper, and
other things in demand.

With the King’s connivance many corsairs launch from this port to
plunder merchants. These corsairs have a covenant with the King that
he shall get all the horses they capture, and all other plunder shall
remain with them. The King does this because he has no horses of his
own, whilst many are shipped from abroad towards India; for no ship
ever goes thither without horses in addition to other cargo. The
practice is naughty and unworthy of a king.


  NOTE 1.—The town of THÁNA, on the landward side of the island
  of Salsette, still exists, about 20 miles from Bombay. The Great
  Peninsular Railroad here crosses the strait which separates
  Salsette from the Continent.

  The _Konkan_ is no doubt what was intended by the kingdom of
  Thána. Albiruni speaks of that city as the capital of Konkan;
  Rashiduddin calls it _Konkan-Tána_, Ibn Batuta _Kúkin-Tána_, the
  last a form which appears in the Carta Catalana as _Cucintana_.
  Tieffentaller writes _Kokan_, and this is said (_Cunningham’s Anc.
  Geog._ 553) to be the local pronunciation. Abulfeda speaks of it as
  a very celebrated place of trade, producing a kind of cloth which
  was called _Tánasi_, bamboos, and _Tabashír_ derived from the ashes
  of the bamboo.

  As early as the 16th year of the Hijra (A.D. 637) an Arab fleet
  from Oman made a hostile descent on the Island of Thána, _i.e._
  Salsette. The place (_Sri Sthánaka_) appears from inscriptions to
  have been the seat of a Hindu kingdom of the Konkan, in the 11th
  century. In Polo’s time Thána seems to have been still under a
  Hindu prince, but it soon afterwards became subject to the Delhi
  sovereigns; and when visited by Jordanus and by Odoric some thirty
  years after Polo’s voyage, a Mussulman governor was ruling there,
  who put to death four Franciscans, the companions of Jordanus.
  Barbosa gives it the compound name of TANA-MAIAMBU, the latter part
  being the first indication I know of the name of Bombay (_Mambai_).
  It was still a place of many mosques, temples, and gardens, but
  the trade was small. Pirates still did business from the port, but
  on a reduced scale. Botero says that there were the remains of an
  immense city to be seen, and that the town still contained 5000
  velvet-weavers (p. 104). Till the Mahrattas took Salsette in 1737,
  the Portuguese had many fine villas about Thána.

  Polo’s dislocation of geographical order here has misled Fra Mauro
  into placing Tana to the west of Guzerat, though he has a duplicate
  Tana nearer the correct position.

  NOTE 2.—It has often been erroneously supposed that the
  frankincense (_olibanum_) of commerce, for which Bombay and the
  ports which preceded it in Western India have for centuries
  afforded the chief mart, was an Indian product. But Marco is not
  making that mistake; he calls the incense of Western India _brown_,
  evidently in contrast with the _white_ incense or olibanum, which
  he afterwards assigns to its true locality (_infra._ ch. xxxvii.,
  xxxviii.). Nor is Marsden justified in assuming that the brown
  incense of Tana must needs have been _Benzoin_ imported from
  Sumatra, though I observe Dr. Birdwood considers that the term
  _Indian Frankincense_ which occurs in Dioscorides must have
  _included_ Benzoin. Dioscorides describes the so-called Indian
  Frankincense as _blackish_; and Garcia supposes the name merely to
  refer to the colour, as he says the Arabs often gave the name of
  Indian to things of a dark colour.

  There seems to be no proof that Benzoin was known even to the
  older Arab writers. Western India supplies a variety of aromatic
  gum-resins, one of which was probably intended by our traveller:

  I. BOSWELLIA THURIFERA of Colebrooke, whose description led to
  a general belief that this tree produced the Frankincense of
  commerce. The tree is found in Oudh and Rohilkhand, in Bahár,
  Central India, Khandesh, and Kattiawár, etc. The gum-resin is used
  and sold locally as an incense, but is soft and sticky, and is
  _not_ the olibanum of commerce; nor is it collected for exportation.

  The Coromandel _Boswellia glabra_ of Roxburgh is now included (see
  Dr. Birdwood’s Monograph) as a variety under the _B. thurifera_.
  Its gum-resin is a good deal used as incense, in the Tamul regions,
  under the name of _Kundrikam_, with which is apparently connected
  _Kundur_, one of the Arabic words for _olibanum_ (see ch. xxxviii.,
  note 2).

  II. _Vateria Indica_ (Roxb.), producing a gum-resin which when
  recent is known as _Piney Varnish_, and when hardened, is sold
  for export under the names of _Indian Copal_, _White Dammar_, and
  others. Its northern limit of growth is North Canara; but the
  gum is exported from Bombay. The tree is the _Chloroxylon Dupada_
  of Buchanan, and is, I imagine, the _Dupu_ or Incense Tree of
  Rheede. (_Hort. Malab._ IV.) The tree is a fine one, and forms
  beautiful avenues in Malabar and Canara. The Hindus use the resin
  as an incense, and in Malabar it is also made into candles which
  burn fragrantly and with little smoke. It is, or was, also used
  as pitch, and is probably the _thus_ with which Indian vessels,
  according to Joseph of Cranganore (in _Novus Orbis_), were payed.
  Garcia took it for the ancient _Cancamum_, but this Dr. Birdwood
  identifies with the next, viz.:—

  III. _Gardenia lucida_ (Roxb.). It grows in the Konkan districts,
  producing a fragrant resin called _Dikamáli_ in India, and by the
  Arabs _Kankham_.

  IV. _Balsamodendron Mukul_, growing in Sind, Kattiawár and the
  Deesa District, and producing the Indian _Bdellium_, _Muḳl_ of the
  Arabs and Persians, used as an incense and as a cordial medicine.
  It is believed to be the Βδέλλα mentioned in the _Periplus_ as
  exported from the Indus, and also as brought down with _Costus_
  through _Ozene_ (Ujjain) to _Barygaza_ (Baroch—see Müller’s _Geog.
  Græc. Minor._ I. 287, 293). It is mentioned also (_Muḳl_) by
  Albiruni as a special product of Kachh, and is probably the incense
  of that region alluded to by Hiuen Tsang. (See last chapter, note
  3.) It is of a yellow, red, or brownish colour. (_Eng. Cyc._ art.
  _Bdellium_; _Dowson’s Elliot_, I. 66; _Reinaud_ in _J. As._ sér.
  IV. tom. iv. p. 263).

  V. _Canarium strictum_ (Roxb.), of the Western Ghats, affording the
  _Black Dammar_ of Malabar, which when fresh is aromatic and yellow
  in colour. It abounds in the country adjoining Tana. The natives
  use it as incense, and call the tree _Dhúp_ (incense) and _Gugul_
  (Bdellium).

  Besides these resinous substances, the _Costus_ of the Ancients may
  be mentioned (Sansk. _Kushṭh_), being still exported from Western
  India, as well as from Calcutta, to China, under the name of
  _Putchok_, to be burnt as incense in Chinese temples. Its identity
  has been ascertained in our own day by Drs. Royle and Falconer, as
  the root of a plant which they called _Aucklandia Costus_. But the
  identity of the _Pucho_ (which he gives as the Malay name) with
  Costus was known to Garcia. Alex. Hamilton, at the beginning of
  last century, calls it _Ligna Dulcis_ (_sic_), and speaks of it as
  an export from Sind, as did the author of the _Periplus_ 1600 years
  earlier.

  My own impression is that _Muḳl_ or _Bdellium_ was the brown
  incense of Polo, especially because we see from Albiruni that this
  was regarded as a staple export from neighbouring regions. But Dr.
  Birdwood considers that the Black Dammar of _Canarium strictum_ is
  in question. (_Report on Indian Gum-Resins_, by _Mr. Dalzell_ of
  Bot. Gard. Bombay, 1866; _Birdwood’s Bombay Products_, 2nd ed. pp.
  282, 287, etc.; _Drury’s Useful Plants of India_, 2nd ed.; _Garcia;
  A. Hamilton_, I. 127; _Eng. Cyc._, art. _Putchuk; Buchanan’s
  Journey_, II. 44, 335, etc.)




                            CHAPTER XXVIII.

                  CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF CAMBAET.


Cambaet is a great kingdom lying further west. The people are
Idolaters, and have a language of their own, and a king of their own,
and are tributary to nobody.{1}

The North Star is here still more clearly visible; and henceforward
the further you go west the higher you see it.

There is a great deal of trade in this country. It produces indigo in
great abundance; and they also make much fine buckram. There is also a
quantity of cotton which is exported hence to many quarters; and there
is a great trade in hides, which are very well dressed; with many other
kinds of merchandize too tedious to mention. Merchants come here with
many ships and cargoes, but what they chiefly bring is gold, silver,
copper [and tutia].

There are no pirates from this country; the inhabitants are good
people, and live by their trade and manufactures.


  NOTE 1.—CAMBAET is nearer the genuine name of the city than our
  CAMBAY. Its proper Hindu name was, according to Colonel Tod,
  _Khambavati_, “the City of the Pillar.” The inhabitants write it
  _Kambáyat_. The ancient city is 3 miles from the existing Cambay,
  and is now overgrown with jungle. It is spoken of as a flourishing
  place by Mas’udi, who visited it in A.D. 915. Ibn Batuta speaks
  of it also as a very fine city, remarkable for the elegance and
  solidity of its mosques, and houses built by wealthy foreign
  merchants. _Cambeth_ is mentioned by Polo’s contemporary Marino
  Sanudo, as one of the two chief Ocean Ports of India; and in the
  15th century Conti calls it 14 miles in circuit. It was still in
  high prosperity in the early part of the 16th century, abounding
  in commerce and luxury, and one of the greatest Indian marts. Its
  trade continued considerable in the time of Federici, towards the
  end of that century; but it has now long disappeared, the local
  part of it being transferred to Gogo and other ports having deeper
  water. Its chief or sole industry now is in the preparation of
  ornamental objects from agates, cornelians, and the like.

  The Indigo of Cambay was long a staple export, and is mentioned by
  Conti, Nikitin, Santo Stefano, Federici, Linschoten, and Abu’l Fazl.

  The independence of Cambay ceased a few years after Polo’s visit;
  for it was taken in the end of the century by the armies of
  Aláuddín Khilji of Delhi, a king whose name survived in Guzerat
  down to our own day as _Aláuddín Khúní_—Bloody Alauddin. (_Rás
  Málá_, I. 235.)




                             CHAPTER XXIX.

                  CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF SEMENAT.


Semenat is a great kingdom towards the west. The people are Idolaters,
and have a king and a language of their own, and pay tribute to nobody.
They are not corsairs, but live by trade and industry as honest people
ought. It is a place of very great trade. They are forsooth cruel
Idolaters.{1}

[Illustration: “The Gates of Somnath,” preserved in the British Arsenal
  at Agra, from a photograph (converted into elevation).]


  NOTE 1.—SOMNATH is the site of the celebrated Temple on the coast
  of Sauráshtra, or Peninsular Guzerat, plundered by Mahmúd of Ghazni
  on his sixteenth expedition to India (A.D. 1023). The term “great
  kingdom” is part of Polo’s formula. But the place was at this time
  of some importance as a commercial port, and much visited by the
  ships of Aden, as Abulfeda tells us. At an earlier date Albiruni
  speaks of it both as the seat of a great Mahadeo much frequented
  by Hindu pilgrims, and as a port of call for vessels on their way
  from Sofala in Africa to China,—a remarkable incidental notice
  of departed trade and civilisation! He does not give Somnath so
  good a character as Polo does; for he names it as one of the
  chief pirate-haunts. And Colonel Tod mentions that the sculptured
  memorial stones on this coast frequently exhibit the deceased as a
  pirate in the act of boarding. In fact, piratical habits continued
  in the islands off the coast of Kattiawár down to our own day.

  Properly speaking, three separate things are lumped together as
  Somnáth: (1) The Port, properly called Veráwal, on a beautiful
  little bay; (2) the City of Deva-Pattan, Somnáth-Pattan, or
  Prabhás, occupying a prominence on the south side of the bay,
  having a massive wall and towers, and many traces of ancient Hindu
  workmanship, though the vast multitude of tombs around shows the
  existence of a large Mussulman population at some time; and among
  these are dates nearly as old as our Traveller’s visit; (3) The
  famous Temple (or, strictly speaking, the object of worship in that
  Temple) crowning a projecting rock at the south-west angle of the
  city, and close to the walls. Portions of columns and sculptured
  fragments strew the soil around.

  Notwithstanding the famous story of Mahmúd and the image stuffed
  with jewels, there is little doubt that the idol really termed
  Somnáth (Moon’s Lord) was nothing but a huge columnar emblem of
  Mahadeo. Hindu authorities mention it as one of the twelve most
  famous emblems of that kind over India, and Ibn Ásir’s account,
  the oldest extant narrative of Mahmúd’s expedition, is to the same
  effect. Every day it was washed with water newly brought from the
  Ganges. Mahmúd broke it to pieces, and with a fragment a step was
  made at the entrance of the Jámi’ Mosque at Ghazni.

  The temples and idols of Pattan underwent a second visitation at
  the hands of Aláuddin’s forces a few years after Polo’s visit
  (1300),[1] and this seems in great measure to have wiped out the
  memory of Mahmúd. The temple, as it now stands deserted, bears
  evident tokens of having been converted into a mosque. A good
  deal of old and remarkable architecture remains, but mixed with
  Moslem work, and no part of the building as it stands is believed
  to be a survival from the time of Mahmúd; though part may belong
  to a reconstruction which was carried out by Raja Bhima Deva of
  Anhilwara about twenty-five years after Mahmúd’s invasion. It is
  remarkable that Ibn Ásir speaks of the temple plundered by Mahmúd
  as “built upon 56 pillars of teak-wood covered with lead.” Is it
  possible that it was a wooden building?

  In connection with this brief chapter on Somnáth we present a
  faithful representation of those Gates which Lord Ellenborough
  rendered so celebrated in connection with that name, when he caused
  them to be removed from the Tomb of Mahmúd, on the retirement of
  our troops from Kabul in 1842. His intention, as announced in that
  once famous _pæan_ of his, was to have them carried solemnly to
  Guzerat, and there restored to the (long desecrated) temple. Calmer
  reflection prevailed, and the Gates were consigned to the Fort of
  Agra, where they still remain.

  Captain J. D. Cunningham, in his _Hist. of the Sikhs_ (p. 209),
  says that in 1831, when Sháh Shúja treated with Ranjít Singh for
  aid to recover his throne, one of the Mahárája’s conditions was the
  restoration of the Gates to Somnáth. This probably put the scheme
  into Lord Ellenborough’s head. But a remarkable fact is, that the
  Sháh reminded Ranjít of _a prophecy that foreboded the downfall of
  the Sikh Empire on the removal of the Ghazni Gates_. This is quoted
  from a report of Captain Wade’s, dated 21st November, 1831. The
  gates were removed to India in the end of 1842. The “Sikh Empire”
  practically collapsed with the murder of Sher Singh in September,
  1843.

  It is not probable that there was any _real_ connection between
  these Gates, of Saracenic design, carved (it is said) in Himalayan
  cedar, and the Temple of Somnáth. But tradition did ascribe to
  them such a connection, and the eccentric prank of a clever man in
  high place made this widely known. Nor in any case can we regard
  as alien to the scope of this book the illustration of a work
  of mediæval Asiatic art, which is quite as remarkable for its
  own character and indisputable history, as for the questionable
  origin ascribed to it. (_Tod’s Travels_, 385, 504; _Burgess,
  Visit to Somnath_, etc.; _Jacob’s Report on Kattywar_, p. 18;
  _Gildemeister_, 185; _Dowson’s Elliot_, II. 468 _seqq._; _Asiatic
  Journal_, 3rd series, vol. I.).

                             CHAPTER XXX.

                 CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF KESMACORAN.


Kesmacoran is a kingdom having a king of its own and a peculiar
language. [Some of] the people are Idolaters, [but the most part
are Saracens]. They live by merchandize and industry, for they are
professed traders, and carry on much traffic by sea and land in all
directions. Their food is rice [and corn], flesh and milk, of which
they have great store. There is no more to be said about them.{1}

And you must know that this kingdom of Kesmacoran is the last in
India as you go towards the west and north-west. You see, from Maabar
on, this province is what is called the GREATER INDIA, and it is the
best of all the Indies. I have now detailed to you all the kingdoms
and provinces and (chief) cities of this India the Greater, that are
upon the seaboard; but of those that lie in the interior I have said
nothing, because that would make too long a story.{2}

And so now let us proceed, and I will tell you of some of the Indian
Islands. And I will begin by two Islands which are called Male and
Female.


  NOTE 1.—Though M. Pauthier has imagined objections there is no
  room for doubt that _Kesmacoran_ is the province of MEKRAN, known
  habitually all over the East as KIJ-MAKRÁN, from the combination
  with the name of the country of that of its chief town, just as we
  lately met with a converse combination in _Konkan-tana_. This was
  pointed out to Marsden by his illustrious friend Major Rennell. We
  find the term _Kij Makrán_ used by Ibn Batuta (III. 47); by the
  Turkish Admiral Sidi ’Ali (_J. As._, sér. I. tom. ix. 72; and _J.
  A. S. B._ V. 463); by Sharifuddin (_P. de la Croix_, I. 379, II.
  417–418); in the famous Sindian Romeo-and-Juliet tale of Sassi and
  Pannún (_Elliot_, I. 333); by Pietro della Valle (I. 724, II. 358);
  by Sir F. Goldsmid (_J. R. A. S._, N.S., I. 38); and see for other
  examples, _J. A. S. B._ VII. 298, 305, 308; VIII. 764; XIV. 158;
  XVII. pt. ii. 559: XX. 262, 263.

  The argument that Mekrán was not a province of India only amounts
  to saying that Polo has made a mistake. But the fact is that it
  often _was_ reckoned to belong to India, from ancient down to
  comparatively modern times. Pliny says: “Many indeed do not reckon
  the Indus to be the western boundary of India, but include in that
  term also four satrapies on this side the river, the Gedrosi,
  the Arachoti, the Arii, and the Parapomisadae (_i.e._ Mekrán,
  Kandahar, Herat, and Kabul) ... whilst others class all these
  together under the name of Ariana” (VI. 23). Arachosia, according
  to Isidore of Charax, was termed by the Parthians “White India.”
  Aelian calls Gedrosia a part of India. (_Hist. Animal._ XVII.
  6.) In the 6th century the Nestorian Patriarch Jesujabus, as we
  have seen (_supra_, ch. xxii. note 1), considered all to be India
  from the coast of Persia, _i.e._ of Fars, beginning from near the
  Gulf. According to Ibn Khordâdhbeh, the boundary between Persia
  and India was seven days’ sail from Hormuz and eight from Daibul,
  or less than half-way from the mouth of the Gulf to the Indus.
  (_J. As._ sér. VI. tom. v. 283.) Beladhori speaks of the Arabs in
  early expeditions as invading Indian territory about the Lake of
  Sijistan; and Istakhri represents this latter country as bounded
  on the north and _partly on the west_ by portions of India. Kabul
  was still reckoned in India. Chach, the last Hindu king of Sind
  but one, is related to have marched through Mekrán to a river
  which formed the limit between Mekrán and Kermán. On its banks he
  planted date-trees, and set up a monument which bore: _“This was
  the boundary of_ HIND in the time of Chach, the son of Síláij, the
  son of Basábas.” In the Geography of Bakui we find it stated that
  “Hind is a great country which begins at the province of Mekrán.”
  (_N. and E._ II. 54.) In the map of Marino Sanuto India begins from
  Hormuz; and it is plain from what Polo says in quitting that city
  that he considered the next step from it south-eastward would have
  taken him to India (_supra_, i. p. 110).

  [“The name Mekran has been commonly, but erroneously, derived from
  Mahi Khoran, _i.e._ the fish-eaters, or _ichthyophagi_, which was
  the title given to the inhabitants of the Beluchi coast-fringe by
  Arrian. But the word is a Dravidian name, and appears as Makara
  in the _Bṛhat Sanhita_ of Varaha Mihira in a list of the tribes
  contiguous to India on the west. It is also the Μακαρήνη of Stephen
  of Byzantium, and the Makuran of Tabari, and Moses of Chorene. Even
  were it not a Dravidian name, in no old Aryan dialect could it
  signify fish-eaters.” (_Curzon, Persia_, II. p. 261, note.)

  “It is to be noted that Kesmacoran is a combination of Kech or Kej
  and Makrán, and the term is even to-day occasionally used.” (_Major
  P. M. Sykes, Persia_, p. 102.)—H. C.]

  We may add a Romance definition of India from _King Alisaunder_:—

      “Lordynges, also I fynde,
       _At Mede so bigynneth Ynde:_
       Forsothe ich woot, it stretcheth ferest
       Of alle the Londes in the Est,
       And oth the South half sikerlyk,
       To the cee taketh of Affryk;
       And the north half to a Mountayne,
       That is yclepèd Caucasayne.”—L 4824–4831.

  It is probable that Polo merely coasted Mekrán; he seems to know
  nothing of the Indus, and what he says of Mekrán is vague.

  NOTE 2.—As Marco now winds up his detail of the Indian coast, it
  is proper to try to throw some light on his partial derangement of
  its geography. In the following columns the first shows the _real_
  geographical order from east to west of the Indian provinces as
  named by Polo, and the second shows the order as _he_ puts them.
  The Italic names are brief and general identifications.

                   _Real order_.              _Polo’s order_.

                                             13. Kesmacoran.

  It is difficult to suppose that the fleet carrying the bride of
  Arghun went out of its way to Maabar, St. Thomas’s, and Telingana.
  And on the other hand, what is said in chapter xxiii. on Comari,
  about the North Star not having been visible since they approached
  the Lesser Java, would have been grossly inaccurate if in the
  interval the travellers had been north as far as Madras and
  Motupalle. That passage suggests to me strongly that Comari was
  the first Indian land made by the fleet on arriving from the
  Archipelago (exclusive _perhaps_ of Ceylon). Note then that the
  position of Eli is marked by its distance of 300 miles from Comari,
  evidently indicating that this was a run made by the traveller _on
  some occasion_ without an intermediate stoppage. Tana, Cambay,
  Somnath, would follow naturally as points of call.

  In Polo’s order, again, the positions of Comari and Coilum are
  transposed, whilst Melibar is introduced as if it were a country
  _westward_ (as Polo views it, northward we should say)[1] of Coilum
  and Eli, instead of including them, and Gozurat is introduced as a
  country lying _eastward_ (or southward, as we should say) of Tana,
  Cambaet, and Semenat, instead of including them, or at least the
  two latter. Moreover, he names no cities in connection with those
  two countries.

  The following hypothesis, really not a complex one, is the most
  probable that I can suggest to account for these confusions.

  I conceive, then, that Cape Comorin (Comari) was the first Indian
  land made by the fleet on the homeward voyage, and that Hili, Tana,
  Cambay, Somnath, were touched at successively as it proceeded
  towards Persia.

  I conceive that in a former voyage to India on the Great Kaan’s
  business Marco had visited Maabar and Kaulam, and gained partly
  from actual visits and partly from information the substance of the
  notices he gives us of Telingana and St. Thomas’s on the one side
  and of Malabar and Guzerat on the other, and that in combining into
  one series the results of the information acquired on two different
  voyages he failed rightly to co-ordinate the material, and thus
  those dislocations which we have noticed occurred, as they very
  easily might, in days when maps had practically no existence; to
  say nothing of the accidents of dictation.

  The expression in this passage for “the cities that lie in the
  interior,” is in the G. T. “_celz qe sunt_ en fra terres”; see I.
  43. Pauthier’s text has “_celles qui sont_ en ferme terre,” which
  is nonsense here.

                             CHAPTER XXXI.

    DISCOURSETH OF THE TWO ISLANDS CALLED MALE AND FEMALE, AND WHY
                          THEY ARE SO CALLED.


When you leave this kingdom of Kesmacoran, which is on the mainland,
you go by sea some 500 miles towards the south; and then you find the
two Islands, MALE and FEMALE, lying about 30 miles distant from one
another. The people are all baptized Christians, but maintain the
ordinances of the Old Testament; thus when their wives are with child
they never go near them till their confinement, or for forty days
thereafter.

In the Island however which is called Male, dwell the men alone,
without their wives or any other women. Every year when the month of
March arrives the men all set out for the other Island, and tarry there
for three months, to wit, March, April, May, dwelling with their wives
for that space. At the end of those three months they return to their
own Island, and pursue their husbandry and trade for the other nine
months.

They find on this Island very fine ambergris. They live on flesh and
milk and rice. They are capital fishermen, and catch a great quantity
of fine large sea-fish, and these they dry, so that all the year they
have plenty of food, and also enough to sell to the traders who go
thither. They have no chief except a bishop, who is subject to the
archbishop of another Island, of which we shall presently speak, called
SCOTRA. They have also a peculiar language.

As for the children which their wives bear to them, if they be girls
they abide with their mothers; but if they be boys the mothers bring
them up till they are fourteen, and then send them to the fathers. Such
is the custom of these two Islands. The wives do nothing but nurse
their children and gather such fruits as their Island produces; for
their husbands do furnish them with all necessaries.{1}


  NOTE 1.—It is not perhaps of much use to seek a serious
  identification of the locality of these Islands, or, as Marsden
  has done, to rationalise the fable. It ran from time immemorial,
  and as nobody ever found the Islands, their locality shifted with
  the horizon, though the legend long hung about Socotra and its
  vicinity. Coronelli’s Atlas (Venice, 1696) identifies these islands
  with those called Abdul Kuri near Cape Gardafui, and the same
  notion finds favour with Marsden. No islands indeed exist in the
  position indicated by Polo if we look to his direction “south of
  Kesmacoran,” but if we take his indication of “half-way between
  Mekrán and Socotra,” the Kuria Muria Islands on the Arabian coast,
  in which M. Pauthier longs to trace these veritable Male and Female
  Isles, will be nearer than any others. Marco’s statement that they
  had a bishop subject to the metropolitan of Socotra certainly looks
  as if certain concrete islands had been associated with the tale.
  Friar Jordanus (p. 44) also places them between India the Greater
  and India Tertia (_i.e._ with him Eastern Africa). Conti locates
  them not more than 5 miles from Socotra, and yet 100 mile distant
  from one another. “Sometimes the men pass over to the women, and
  sometimes the women pass over to the men, and each return to their
  own respective island before the expiration of six months. Those
  who remain on the island of the others beyond this fatal period die
  immediately” (p. 21). Fra Mauro places the islands to the south of
  Zanzibar, and gives them the names of _Mangla_ and _Nebila_. One is
  curious to know whence came these names, one of which seems to be
  Sanskrit, the other (also in Sanudo’s map) Arabic; (_Nabílah_, Ar.,
  “Beautiful”; _Mangala_, Sansk. “Fortunate”).

  A savour of the story survived to the time of the Portuguese
  discoveries, and it had by that time attached itself to Socotra.
  (_De Barros_, Dec. II. Liv. i. cap. 3; _Bartoli, H. della Comp. di
  Gesù_, Asia, I. p. 37; _P. Vincenzo_, p. 443.)

  The story was, I imagine, a mere ramification of the ancient and
  wide-spread fable of the Amazons, and is substantially the same
  that Palladius tells of the Brahmans; how the men lived on one side
  of the Ganges and the women on the other. The husbands visited
  their wives for 40 days only in June, July, and August, “those
  being their cold months, as the sun was then to the north.” And
  when a wife had once borne a child the husband returned no more.
  (_Müller’s Ps. Callisth._ 105.) The Mahábhárata celebrates the
  Amazon country of Ráná Paramitá, where the regulations were much as
  in Polo’s islands, only male children were put to death, and men if
  they overstayed a month. (_Wheeler’s India_, I. 400.)

  Hiuen Tsang’s version of the legend agrees with Marco’s in placing
  the Woman’s Island to the south of Persia. It was called the
  _Kingdom of Western Women_. There were none but women to be seen.
  It was under _Folin_ (the Byzantine Empire), and the ruler thereof
  sent husbands every year; if boys were born, the law prohibited
  their being brought up. (_Vie et Voyages_, p. 268.) Alexander, in
  Ferdúsi’s poem, visits the City of Women on an island in the sea,
  where no man was allowed.

  The Chinese accounts, dating from the 5th century, of a remote
  Eastern Land called Fusang, which Neumann fancied to have been
  Mexico, mention that to the east of that region again there was a
  Woman’s Island, with the usual particulars. (_Lassen_, IV. 751.)
  [Cf. _G. Schlegel, Niu Kouo, T’oung Pao_, III. pp. 495–510.—H. C.]
  Oddly enough, Columbus heard the same story of an island called
  Matityna or Matinino (apparently Martinique) which he sighted on
  his second voyage. The Indians on board “asserted that it had no
  inhabitants but women, who at a certain time of the year were
  visited by the Cannibals (Caribs); if the children born were boys
  they were brought up and sent to their fathers, if girls they were
  retained by the mothers. They reported also that these women had
  certain subterranean caverns in which they took refuge if any one
  went thither except at the established season,” etc. (_P. Martyr_
  in _Ramusio_, III. 3 _v._ and see 85.) Similar Amazons are placed
  by Adam of Bremen on the Baltic Shores, a story there supposed to
  have originated in a confusion between Gwenland, _i.e._ Finland,
  and a land of _Cwens_ or Women.

  Mendoza heard of the like in the vicinity of Japan (perhaps the
  real Fusang story), though he opines judiciously that “this is
  very doubtful to be beleeved, although I have bin certified by
  religious men that have talked with persons that within these two
  yeares have beene at the saide ilands, and have seene the saide
  women.” (_H. of China_, II. 301.) Lane quotes a like tale about a
  horde of Cossacks whose wives were said to live apart on certain
  islands in the Dnieper. (_Arab. Nights_, 1859, III. 479.) The
  same story is related by a missionary in the _Lettres Édifiantes_
  of certain unknown islands supposed to lie south of the Marian
  group. Pauthier, from whom I derive this last instance, draws the
  conclusion: “On voit que le récit de Marc Pol est loin d’être
  imaginaire.” Mine from the premises would be different!

  Sometimes the fable took another form; in which the women are
  entirely isolated, as in that which Mela quotes from Hanno (III.
  9). So with the Isle of Women which Kazwini and Bakui place to the
  South of China. They became enceinte by the Wind, or by eating a
  particular fruit [or by plunging into the sea; cf. _Schlegel_,
  _l.c._—H. C.], or, as in a Chinese tradition related by Magaillans,
  by looking at their own faces in a well! The like fable is
  localised by the Malays in the island of Engano off Sumatra, and
  was related to Pigafetta of an island under Great Java called
  Ocoloro, perhaps the same.

  (_Magail._ 76; _Gildem._ 196; _N. et Ex._ II. 398; _Pigafetta_,
  173; _Marsden’s Sumatra_, 1st ed. p. 264.)




                            CHAPTER XXXII.

                   CONCERNING THE ISLAND OF SCOTRA.


When you leave those two Islands and go about 500 miles further towards
the south, then you come to an Island called SCOTRA. The people are
all baptized Christians; and they have an Archbishop. They have a
great deal of ambergris; and plenty also of cotton stuffs and other
merchandize; especially great quantities of salt fish of a large and
excellent kind. They also eat flesh and milk and rice, for that is
their only kind of corn; and they all go naked like the other Indians.

[The ambergris comes from the stomach of the whale, and as it is a
great object of trade, the people contrive to take the whales with
barbed iron darts, which, once they are fixed in the body, cannot
come out again. A long cord is attached to this end, to that a small
buoy which floats on the surface, so that when the whale dies they
know where to find it. They then draw the body ashore and extract the
ambergris from the stomach and the oil from the head.{1}]

There is a great deal of trade there, for many ships come from all
quarters with goods to sell to the natives. The merchants also purchase
gold there, by which they make a great profit; and all the vessels
bound for Aden touch at this Island.

Their Archbishop has nothing to do with the Pope of Rome, but is
subject to the great Archbishop who lives at Baudas. He rules over the
Bishop of that Island, and over many other Bishops in those regions of
the world, just as our Pope does in these.{2}

A multitude of corsairs frequent the Island; they come there and encamp
and put up their plunder to sale; and this they do to good profit,
for the Christians of the Island purchase it, knowing well that it is
Saracen or Pagan gear.{3}

And you must know that in this Island there are the best enchanters in
the world. It is true that their Archbishop forbids the practice to the
best of his ability; but ’tis all to no purpose, for they insist that
their forefathers followed it, and so must they also. I will give you
a sample of their enchantments. Thus, if a ship be sailing past with a
fair wind and a strong, they will raise a contrary wind and compel her
to turn back. In fact they make the wind blow as they list, and produce
great tempests and disasters; and other such sorceries they perform,
which it will be better to say nothing about in our Book.{4}


  NOTE 1.—Mr. Blyth appears to consider that the only whale met with
  nowadays in the Indian Sea _north of the line_ is a great Rorqual
  or _Balaenoptera_, to which he gives the specific name of _Indica_.
  (See _J. A. S. B._ XXVIII. 481.) The text, however (from Ramusio),
  clearly points to the Spermaceti whale; and Maury’s Whale-Chart
  consists with this.

  “The best ambergris,” says Mas’udi, “is found on the islands and
  coasts of the Sea of Zinj (Eastern Africa); it is round, of a pale
  blue, and sometimes as big as an ostrich egg.... These are morsels
  which have been swallowed by the fish called _Awál_. When the sea
  is much agitated it casts up fragments of amber almost like lumps
  of rock, and the fish swallowing these is choked thereby, and
  floats on the surface. The men of Zinj, or wherever it be, then
  come in their canoes, and fall on the creature with harpoons and
  cables, draw it ashore, cut it up, and extract the ambergris” (I.
  134).

  Kazwini speaks of whales as often imprisoned by the ebb tide in the
  channels about Basra. The people harpooned them, and got much oil
  _out of the brain_, which they used for lamps, and smearing their
  ships. This also is clearly the sperm whale. (_Ethé_, p. 268.)

  After having been long doubted, scientific opinion seems to have
  come back to the opinion that ambergris is an excretion from the
  whale. “Ambergris is a morbid secretion in the intestines of the
  cachalot, deriving its origin either from the stomach or biliary
  ducts, and allied in its nature to gall-stones, ... whilst the
  masses found floating on the sea are those that have been voided
  by the whale, or liberated from the dead animal by the process of
  putrefaction.” (_Bennett, Whaling Voyage Round the Globe_, 1840,
  II. 326.)

  [“The _Pen ts’ao_, ch. xliii. fol. 5, mentions ambergris under
  the name _lung sien hiang_ (dragon’s saliva perfume), and
  describes it as a sweet-scented product, which is obtained from
  the south-western sea. It is greasy, and at first yellowish
  white; when dry, it forms pieces of a yellowish black colour. In
  spring whole herds of dragons swim in that sea, and vomit it out.
  Others say that it is found in the belly of a large fish. This
  description also doubtless points to ambergris, which in reality is
  a pathological secretion of the intestines of the spermaceti whale
  (_Physeter macrocephalus_), a large cetaceous animal. The best
  ambergris is collected on the Arabian coast. In the _Ming shi_ (ch.
  cccxxvi.) _lung sien hiang_ is mentioned as a product of _Bu-la-wa_
  (_Brava_, on the east coast of Africa), and _an-ba-rh_ (evidently
  also ambergris) amongst the products of _Dsu-fa-rh_ (_Dsahfar_, on
  the south coast of Arabia).” (_Bretschneider, Med. Res._ I. p. 152,
  note.)—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—_Scotra_ probably represented the usual pronunciation
  of the name SOCOTRA, which has been hypothetically traced to a
  Sanskrit original, _Dvípa-Sukhádhára_, “the Island Abode of Bliss,”
  from which (contracted _Diuskadra_) the Greeks made “the island of
  _Dioscorides_.”

  So much painful interest attaches to the history of a people once
  Christian, but now degenerated almost to savagery, that some detail
  maybe permitted on this subject.

  The _Periplus_ calls the island very large, but desolate; ... the
  inhabitants were few, and dwelt on the north side. They were of
  foreign origin, being a mixture of Arabs, Indians, and Greeks, who
  had come thither in search of gain.... The island was under the
  king of the Incense Country.... Traders came from _Muza_ (near
  Mocha) and sometimes from _Limyrica_ and _Barygaza_ (Malabar and
  Guzerat), bringing rice, wheat, and Indian muslins, with female
  slaves, which had a ready sale. Cosmas (6th century) says there
  was in the island a bishop, appointed from Persia. The inhabitants
  spoke Greek, having been originally settled there by the Ptolemies.
  “There are clergy there also, ordained and sent from Persia to
  minister among the people of the island, and a multitude of
  Christians. We sailed past the island, but did not land. I met,
  however, with people from it who were on their way to Ethiopia, and
  they spoke Greek.”

  The ecclesiastical historian Nicephorus Callistus seems to allude
  to the people of Socotra, when he says that among the nations
  visited by the missionary Theophilus, in the time of Constantius,
  were “the Assyrians on the verge of the outer ocean towards the
  East ... whom Alexander the Great, after driving them from Syria,
  sent thither to settle, and to this day they keep their mother
  tongue, though all of the blackest, through the power of the sun’s
  rays.” The Arab voyagers of the 9th century say that the island was
  colonised with Greeks by Alexander the Great, in order to promote
  the culture of the Socotrine aloes; when the other Greeks adopted
  Christianity these did likewise, and they had continued to retain
  their profession of it. The colonising by Alexander is probably a
  fable, but invented to account for facts.

  [Edrisi says (_Jaubert’s transl._ pp. 47, _seqq._) that the chief
  produce of Socotra is aloes, and that most of the inhabitants
  of this island are Christians; for this reason: when Alexander
  had subjugated Porus, his master Aristotle gave him the advice
  to seek after the island producing aloes; after his conquest of
  India, Alexander remembered the advice, and on his return journey
  from the Sea of India to the Sea of Oman, he stopped at Socotra,
  which he greatly admired for its fertility and the pleasantness
  of its climate. Acting on the advice of Aristotle, Alexander
  removed the inhabitants from their island, and established in
  their place a colony of Ionians, to whom he entrusted the care of
  cultivating aloes. These Greeks were converted when the Christian
  religion was preached to them, and their descendants have remained
  Christians.—H. C.]

  In the list of the metropolitan Sees of the Nestorian Church
  we find one called _Kotrobah_, which is supposed to stand for
  Socotra. According to Edrisi, Kotrobah was an island inhabited by
  Christians; he speaks of Socotra separately, but no island suits
  his description of Kotrobah but Socotra itself; and I suspect that
  we have here geography in duplicate, no uncommon circumstance.
  There is an epistle extant from the Nestorian Patriarch Jesujabus
  (A.D. 650–660), _ad Episcopos Catarensium_, which Assemani
  interprets of the Christians in Socotra and the adjacent coasts
  of Arabia (III. 133).[1] Abulfeda says the people of Socotra were
  Nestorian Christians and pirates. Nicolo Conti, in the first half
  of the 15th century, spent two months on the island (_Sechutera_).
  He says it was for the most part inhabited by Nestorian Christians.

  [Professor W. R. Smith, in a letter to Sir H. Yule, dated
  Cambridge, 15th June, 1886, writes: “The authorities for Kotrobah
  seem to be (1) Edrisi, (2) the list of Nestorian Bishops in
  Assemani. There is no trace of such a name anywhere else that I
  can find. But there is a place called Ḳaṭar about which most of
  the Arab Geographers know very little, but which is mentioned in
  poetry. Bekri, who seems best informed, says that it lay between
  Bahrain and Oman.... Iṣṭakhri and Ibn Ḥaukal speak of the Ḳaṭar
  pirates. Their collective name is the Ḳaṭaríya.”]

  Some indications point rather to a connection of the island’s
  Christianity with the Jacobite or Abyssinian Church. Thus they
  practised circumcision, as mentioned by Maffei in noticing the
  proceedings of Alboquerque at Socotra. De Barros calls them
  Jacobite Christians of the Abyssinian stock. Barbosa speaks of them
  as an olive-coloured people, Christian only in name, having neither
  baptism nor Christian knowledge, and having for many years lost all
  acquaintance with the Gospel. Andrea Corsali calls them Christian
  shepherds of Ethiopian race, like Abyssinians. They lived on dates,
  milk, and butter; some rice was imported. They had churches like
  mosques, but with altars in Christian fashion.

  When Francis Xavier visited the island there were still distinct
  traces of the Church. The people reverenced the cross, placing it
  on their altars, and hanging it round their necks. Every village
  had its minister, whom they called _Kashís_ (_Ar._ for a Christian
  Presbyter), to whom they paid tithe. No man could read. The Kashís
  repeated prayers antiphonetically in a forgotten tongue, which De
  Barros calls Chaldee, frequently scattering incense; a word like
  _Alleluia_ often recurred. For bells they used wooden rattles.
  They assembled in their churches four times a day, and held St.
  Thomas in great veneration. The Kashíses married, but were very
  abstemious. They had two Lents, and then fasted strictly from meat,
  milk, and fish.

  The last vestiges of Christianity in Socotra, so far as we know,
  are those traced by P. Vincenzo, the Carmelite, who visited the
  island after the middle of the 17th century. The people still
  retained a profession of Christianity, but without any knowledge,
  and with a strange jumble of rites; sacrificing to the moon;
  circumcising; abominating wine and pork. They had churches which
  they called _Moquame_ (_Ar. Maḳám_, “Locus, Statio”?), dark, low,
  and dirty, daily anointed with butter. On the altar was a cross
  and a candle. The cross was regarded with ignorant reverence, and
  carried in processions. They assembled in their churches three
  times in the day, and three times in the night, and in their
  worship burned much incense, etc. The priests were called _Odambo_,
  elected and consecrated by the people, and changed every year. Of
  baptism and other sacraments they had no knowledge.

  There were two races: one, black with crisp hair; the other, less
  black, of better aspect, and with straight hair. Each family had
  a cave in which they deposited their dead. They cultivated a few
  palms, and kept flocks; had no money, no writing, and kept tale of
  their flocks by bags of stones. They often committed suicide in
  age, sickness, or defeat. When rain failed they selected a victim
  by lot, and placing him within a circle, addressed prayers to the
  moon. If without success they cut off the poor wretch’s hands. They
  had many who practised sorcery. The women were all called _Maria_,
  which the author regarded as a relic of Christianity; this De
  Barros also notices a century earlier.

  Now, not a trace of former Christianity can be discovered—unless it
  be in the name of one of the villages on the coast, _Colesseeah_,
  which looks as if it faintly commemorated both the ancient religion
  and the ancient language (ἐκκλησία). The remains of one building,
  traditionally a place of worship, were shown to Wellsted; he could
  find nothing to connect it with Christianity.

  The social state of the people is much as Father Vincenzo described
  it; lower it could scarcely be. Mahomedanism is now the universal
  profession. The people of the interior are still of distinct race,
  with curly hair, Indian complexion, regular features. The coast
  people are a mongrel body, of Arab and other descent. Probably in
  old times the case was similar, and the civilisation and Greek may
  have been confined to the littoral foreigners. (_Müller’s Geog.

  NOTE 3.—As far back as the 10th century Socotra was a noted
  haunt of pirates. Mas’udi says: “Socotra is one of the stations
  frequented by the Indian corsairs called _Bawárij_, which chase the
  Arab ships bound for India and China, just as the Greek galleys
  chase the Mussulmans in the sea of Rúm along the coasts of Syria
  and Egypt” (III. 37). The _Bawárij_ were corsairs of Kach’h and
  Guzerat, so called from using a kind of war-vessel called _Bárja_.
  (_Elliot_, I. 65.) Ibn Batuta tells a story of a friend of his,
  the Shaikh Sa’íd, superior of a convent at Mecca, who had been
  to India and got large presents at the court of Delhi. With a
  comrade called Hajji Washl, who was also carrying a large sum to
  buy horses, “when they arrived at the island of Socotra ... they
  were attacked by Indian corsairs with a great number of vessels....
  The corsairs took everything out of the ship, and then left it to
  the crew with its tackle, so that they were able to reach Aden.”
  Ibn Batuta’s remark on this illustrates what Polo has said of the
  Malabar pirates, in ch. xxv. _supra_: “The custom of these pirates
  is not to kill or drown anybody when the actual fighting is over.
  They take all the property of the passengers, and then let them go
  whither they will with their vessel” (I. 362–363).

  NOTE 4.—We have seen that P. Vincenzo alludes to the sorceries
  of the people; and De Barros also speaks of the _feiticeria_ or
  witchcraft by which the women drew ships to the island, and did
  other marvels (u.s.).

                            CHAPTER XXXIII.

                 CONCERNING THE ISLAND OF MADEIGASCAR.


Madeigascar is an Island towards the south, about a thousand miles from
Scotra. The people are all Saracens, adoring Mahommet. They have four
_Esheks_, _i.e._ four Elders, who are said to govern the whole Island.
And you must know that it is a most noble and beautiful Island, and one
of the greatest in the world, for it is about 4000 miles in compass.
The people live by trade and handicrafts.

In this Island, and in another beyond it called ZANGHIBAR, about which
we shall tell you afterwards, there are more elephants than in any
country in the world. The amount of traffic in elephants’ teeth in
these two Islands is something astonishing.

In this Island they eat no flesh but that of camels; and of these
they kill an incredible number daily. They say it is the best and
wholesomest of all flesh; and so they eat of it all the year round.{1}

They have in this Island many trees of red sanders, of excellent
quality; in fact, all their forests consist of it.{2} They have also a
quantity of ambergris, for whales are abundant in that sea, and they
catch numbers of them; and so are _Oil-heads_, which are a huge kind of
fish, which also produce ambergris like the whale.{3} There are numbers
of leopards, bears, and lions in the country, and other wild beasts in
abundance. Many traders, and many ships go thither with cloths of gold
and silk, and many other kinds of goods, and drive a profitable trade.

You must know that this Island lies so far south that ships cannot go
further south or visit other Islands in that direction, except this
one, and that other of which we have to tell you, called Zanghibar.
This is because the sea-current runs so strong towards the south that
the ships which should attempt it never would get back again. Indeed,
the ships of Maabar which visit this Island of Madeigascar, and that
other of Zanghibar, arrive thither with marvellous speed, for great as
the distance is they accomplish it in 20 days, whilst the return voyage
takes them more than 3 months. This (I say) is because of the strong
current running south, which continues with such singular force and in
the same direction at all seasons.{4}

’Tis said that in those other Islands to the south, which the ships are
unable to visit because this strong current prevents their return, is
found the bird _Gryphon_, which appears there at certain seasons. The
description given of it is however entirely different from what our
stories and pictures make it. For persons who had been there and had
seen it told Messer Marco Polo that it was for all the world like an
eagle, but one indeed of enormous size; so big in fact that its wings
covered an extent of 30 paces, and its quills were 12 paces long, and
thick in proportion. And it is so strong that it will seize an elephant
in its talons and carry him high into the air, and drop him so that he
is smashed to pieces; having so killed him the bird gryphon swoops down
on him and eats him at leisure. The people of those isles call the bird
_Ruc_, and it has no other name.{5} So I wot not if this be the real
gryphon, or if there be another manner of bird as great. But this I can
tell you for certain, that they are not half lion and half bird as our
stories do relate; but enormous as they be they are fashioned just like
an eagle.

The Great Kaan sent to those parts to enquire about these curious
matters, and the story was told by those who went thither. He also
sent to procure the release of an envoy of his who had been despatched
thither, and had been detained; so both those envoys had many wonderful
things to tell the Great Kaan about those strange islands, and about
the birds I have mentioned. [They brought (as I heard) to the Great
Kaan a feather of the said Ruc, which was stated to measure 90 spans,
whilst the quill part was two palms in circumference, a marvellous
object! The Great Kaan was delighted with it, and gave great presents
to those who brought it.{6}] They also brought two boars’ tusks, which
weighed more than 14 lbs. a-piece; and you may gather how big the boar
must have been that had teeth like that! They related indeed that there
were some of those boars as big as a great buffalo. There are also
numbers of giraffes and wild asses; and in fact a marvellous number of
wild beasts of strange aspect.{7}


  NOTE 1.—Marco is, I believe, the first writer European or Asiatic,
  who unambiguously speaks of MADAGASCAR; but his information about
  it was very incorrect in many particulars. There are no elephants
  nor camels in the island, nor any leopards, bears, or lions.

  Indeed, I have no doubt that Marco, combining information from
  different sources, made some confusion between _Makdashau_
  (Magadoxo) and _Madagascar_, and that particulars belonging to
  both are mixed up here. This accounts for Zanghibar being placed
  entirely _beyond_ Madagascar, for the entirely Mahomedan character
  given to the population, for the hippopotamus-teeth and staple
  trade in ivory, as well as for the lions, elephants, and other
  beasts. But above all the camel-killing indicates Sumáli Land and
  Magadoxo as the real locality of part of the information. Says Ibn
  Batuta: “After leaving Zaila we sailed on the sea for 15 days,
  and arrived at Makdashau, an extremely large town. The natives
  keep camels in great numbers, _and they slaughter several hundreds
  daily_” (II. 181). The slaughter of camels for food is still a
  Sumáli practice. (See _J. R. G. S._ VI. 28, and XIX. 55.) Perhaps
  the _Shaikhs_ (_Esceqe_) also belong to the same quarter, for the
  Arab traveller says that the Sultan of Makdashau had no higher
  title than _Shaikh_ (183); and Brava, a neighbouring settlement,
  was governed by 12 shaikhs. (_De Barros_, I. viii. 4.) Indeed, this
  kind of local oligarchy still prevails on that coast.

  We may add that both Makdashau and Brava are briefly described in
  the Annals of the Ming Dynasty. The former, _Mu-ku-tu-su_, lies on
  the sea, 20 days from _Siao-Kolan_ (Quilon?), a barren mountainous
  country of wide extent, where it sometimes does not rain for years.
  In 1427 a mission came from this place to China. _Pu-la-wa_ (Brava,
  properly Baráwa) adjoins the former, and is also on the sea. It
  produces olibanum, myrrh, and _ambergris_; and among animals
  elephants, camels, rhinoceroses, spotted animals like asses, etc.[1]

  It is, however, true that there are traces of a considerable
  amount of ancient Arab colonisation on the shores of Madagascar.
  Arab descent is ascribed to a class of the people of the province
  of Matitánana on the east coast, in lat. 21°–23° south, and the
  Arabic writing is in use there. The people of the St. Mary’s Isle
  of our maps off the east coast, in lat. 17°, also call themselves
  the children of Ibrahim, and the island _Nusi-Ibrahim_. And on the
  north-west coast, at Bambeluka Bay, Captain Owen found a large Arab
  population, whose forefathers had been settled there from time
  immemorial. The number of tombs here and in Magambo Bay showed that
  the Arab population had once been much greater. The government of
  this settlement, till conquered by Radama, was vested in three
  persons: one a Malagash, the second an Arab, the third as guardian
  of strangers; a fact also suggestive of Polo’s four sheikhs
  (_Ellis_, I. 131; _Owen_, II. 102, 132. See also _Sonnerat_, II.
  56.) Though the Arabs were in the habit of navigating to Sofala,
  in about lat. 20° south, in the time of Mas’udi (beginning of
  10th century), and must have then known Madagascar, there is no
  intelligible indication of it in any of their geographies that have
  been translated.[2]

  [M. Alfred Grandidier, in his _Hist. de la Géog. de Madagascar_,
  p. 31, comes to the conclusion that Marco Polo has given a very
  exact description of Magadoxo, but that he did not know the island
  of Madagascar. He adds in a note that Yule has shown that the
  description of Madeigascar refers partly to Magadoxo, but that
  notwithstanding he (Yule) believed that Polo spoke of Madagascar
  when the Venetian traveller does not. I must say that I do not see
  any reason why Yule’s theory should not be accepted.

  M. G. Ferrand, formerly French Agent at Fort Dauphin, has devoted
  ch. ix. (pp. 83–90) of the second part of his valuable work
  _Les Musulmans à Madagascar_ (Paris, 1893), to the “Etymology
  of Madagascar.” He believes that M. Polo really means the great
  African Island. I mention from his book that M. Guët (_Origines
  de l’île Bourbon_, 1888) brings the Carthaginians to Madagascar,
  and derives the name of this island from _Madax-Aschtoret_ or
  _Madax-Astarté_, which signifies _Isle of Astarté_ and _Isle of
  Tanit_! Mr. I. Taylor (_The origin of the name_ ‘Madagascar,’ in
  _Antananarivo Annual_, 1891) gives also some fancy etymologies;
  it is needless to mention them. M. Ferrand himself thinks that
  very likely Madagascar simply means _Country of the Malagash_
  (Malgaches), and is only a bad transcription of the Arabic
  _Madagasbar_.—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—There is, or used to be, a trade in sandal-wood from
  Madagascar. (See _Owen_, II. 99.) In the map of S. Lorenzo (or
  Madagascar) in the _Isole_ of Porcacchi (1576), a map evidently
  founded on fact, I observe near the middle of the Island: _quivi
  sono boschi di sandari rossi_.

  NOTE 3.—“The coast of this province” (Ivongo, the N.E. of the
  Island) “abounds with whales, and during a certain period of the
  year Antongil Bay is a favourite resort for whalers of all nations.
  The inhabitants of Titingue are remarkably expert in spearing the
  whales from their slight canoes.” (_Lloyd_ in _J. R. G. S._ XX.
  56.) A description of the whale-catching process practised by the
  Islanders of St. Mary’s, or Nusi Ibrahim, is given in the _Quinta
  Pars Indiae Orientalis_ of _De Bry_, p. 9. Owen gives a similar
  account (I. 170).

  The word which I have rendered _Oil-heads_ is _Capdoilles_ or
  _Capdols_, representing _Capidoglio_, the appropriate name still
  applied in Italy to the Spermaceti whale. The _Vocab. Ital. Univ._
  quotes Ariosto (VII. 36):—

              —“_I_ Capidogli _co’ vecchi marini_
      _Vengon turbati dal lor pigro sonno_.”

  The Spermaceti-whale is described under this name by Rondeletius,
  but from his cut it is clear he had not seen the animal.

  NOTE 4.—De Barros, after describing the dangers of the Channel of
  Mozambique, adds: “And as the Moors of this coast of Zanguebar make
  their voyages in ships and sambuks sewn with coir, instead of being
  nailed like ours, and thus strong enough to bear the force of the
  cold seas of the region about the Cape of Good Hope, ... they never
  dared to attempt the exploration of the regions to the westward
  of the Cape of Currents, although they greatly desired to do so.”
  (Dec. I. viii. 4; and see also IV. i. 12.) Kazwini says of the
  Ocean, quoting Al Biruni: “Then it extends to the sea known as
  that of Berbera, and stretches from Aden to the furthest extremity
  of Zanjibar; beyond this goes no vessel on account of the great
  current. Then it extends to what are called the Mountains of the
  Moon, whence spring the sources of the Nile of Egypt, and thence to
  Western Sudan, to the Spanish Countries and the (Western) Ocean.”
  There has been recent controversy between Captain A. D. Taylor
  and Commodore Jansen of the Dutch navy, regarding the Mozambique
  currents, and (incidentally) Polo’s accuracy. The currents in the
  Mozambique Channel vary with the monsoons, but from Cape Corrientes
  southward along the coast runs the permanent Lagullas current,
  and Polo’s statement requires but little correction. (_Ethé_ pp.
  214–215; see also _Barbosa_ in _Ram._ I. 288; _Owen_, I. 269;
  _Stanley’s Correa_, p. 261; _J. R. G. S._ II. 91; _Fra Mauro_ in
  _Zurla_, p. 61; see also _Reinaud’s Abulfeda_, vol. i. pp. 15–16;
  and _Ocean Highways_, August to November, 1873.)

  [Illustration: The Rukh (from Lane’s “Arabian Nights”), after a
    Persian drawing.]

  NOTE 5.—The fable of the RUKH was old and widely spread, like
  that of the Male and Female Islands, and, just as in that case,
  one accidental circumstance or another would give it a local
  habitation, now here now there. The _Garuda_ of the Hindus, the
  _Simurgh_ of the old Persians, the _’Angka_ of the Arabs, the _Bar
  Yuchre_ of the Rabbinical legends, the _Gryps_ of the Greeks, were
  probably all versions of the same original fable.

  Bochart quotes a bitter Arabic proverb which says, “Good-Faith,
  the Ghul, and the Gryphon (_’Angka_) are three names of things
  that exist nowhere.” And Mas’udi, after having said that whatever
  country he visited he always found that the people believed these
  monstrous creatures to exist in regions as remote as possible from
  their own, observes: “It is not that our reason absolutely rejects
  the possibility of the existence of the _Nesnás_ (see vol. i. p.
  206) or of the _’Angka_, and other beings of that rare and wondrous
  order; for there is nothing in their existence incompatible with
  the Divine Power; but we decline to believe in them because their
  existence has not been manifested to us on any irrefragable
  authority.”

  [Illustration: Frontispiece showing the Bird _Rukh_.]

  The circumstance which for the time localized the Rukh in the
  direction of Madagascar was perhaps some rumour of the great fossil
  _Aepyornis_ and its colossal eggs, found in that island. According
  to Geoffroy St. Hilaire, the Malagashes assert that the bird which
  laid those great eggs still exists, that it has an immense power
  of flight, and preys upon the greater quadrupeds. Indeed the
  continued existence of the bird has been alleged as late as 1861
  and 1863!

  On the great map of Fra Mauro (1459) near the extreme point of
  Africa which he calls _Cavo de Diab_, and which is suggestive of
  the Cape of Good Hope, but was really perhaps Cape Corrientes,
  there is a rubric inscribed with the following remarkable story:
  “About the year of Our Lord 1420 a ship or junk of India in
  crossing the Indian Sea was driven by way of the Islands of Men
  and Women beyond the Cape of Diab, and carried between the Green
  Islands and the Darkness in a westerly and south-westerly direction
  for 40 days, without seeing anything but sky and sea, during which
  time they made to the best of their judgment 2000 miles. The gale
  then ceasing they turned back, and were seventy days in getting to
  the aforesaid Cape Diab. The ship having touched on the coast to
  supply its wants, the mariners beheld there the egg of a certain
  bird called _Chrocho_, which egg was as big as a butt.[3] And the
  bigness of the bird is such that between the extremities of the
  wings is said to be 60 paces. They say too that it carries away an
  elephant or any other great animal with the greatest ease, and does
  great injury to the inhabitants of the country, and is most rapid
  in its flight.”

  G.-St. Hilaire considered the Aepyornis to be of the Ostrich
  family; Prince C. Buonaparte classed it with the _Inepti_ or Dodos;
  Duvernay of Valenciennes with aquatic birds! There was clearly
  therefore room for difference of opinion, and Professor Bianconi
  of Bologna, who has written much on the subject, concludes that it
  was most probably a bird of the vulture family. This would go far,
  he urges, to justify Polo’s account of the Ruc as a bird of prey,
  though the story of its _lifting_ any large animal could have had
  no foundation, as the feet of the vulture kind are unfit for such
  efforts. Humboldt describes the habit of the condor of the Andes
  as that of worrying, wearying, and frightening its four-footed
  prey until it drops; sometimes the condor drives its victim over a
  precipice.

  Bianconi concludes that on the same scale of proportion as the
  condor’s, the great quills of the Aepyornis would be about 10 feet
  long, and the spread of the wings about 32 feet, whilst the height
  of the bird would be at least four times that of the condor. These
  are indeed little more than conjectures. And I must add that in
  Professor Owen’s opinion there is no reasonable doubt that the
  Aepyornis was a bird allied to the Ostriches.

  We gave, in the first edition of this work, a drawing of the great
  Aepyornis egg in the British Museum of its true size, as the
  nearest approach we could make to an illustration of the _Rukh_
  from nature. The actual contents of this egg will be about 2·35
  gallons, which may be compared with Fra Mauro’s _anfora_! Except in
  this matter of size, his story of the ship and the egg may be true.

  A passage from Temple’s Travels in Peru has been quoted as
  exhibiting exaggeration in the description of the condor surpassing
  anything that can be laid to Polo’s charge here; but that is, in
  fact, only somewhat heavy banter directed against our traveller’s
  own narrative. (See _Travels in Various Parts of Peru_, 1830, II.
  414–417.)

  Recently fossil bones have been found in New Zealand, which seem
  to bring us a step nearer to the realization of the Rukh. Dr.
  Haast discovered in a swamp at Glenmark in the province of Otago,
  along with remains of the _Dinornis_ or Moa, some bones (femur,
  ungual phalanges, and rib) of a gigantic bird which he pronounces
  to be a bird of prey, apparently allied to the Harriers, and calls
  _Harpagornis_. He supposes it to have preyed upon the Moa, and
  as that fowl is calculated to have been 10 feet and upwards in
  height, we are not so very far from the elephant-devouring Rukh.
  (See _Comptes Rendus, Ac. des Sciences_ 1872, p. 1782; and _Ibis_,
  October 1872, p. 433.) This discovery may possibly throw a new
  light on the traditions of the New Zealanders. For Professor Owen,
  in first describing the _Dinornis_ in 1839, mentioned that the
  natives had a tradition that the bones belonged _to a bird of the
  eagle kind_. (See _Eng. Cyc._ Nat. Hist. sub. v. _Dinornis_.) And
  Sir Geo. Grey appears to have read a paper, 23rd October 1872,[4]
  which was the description by a Maori of the _Hokiol_, an extinct
  gigantic bird of prey of which that people have traditions come
  down from their ancestors, said to have been a black hawk of great
  size, as large as the Moa.

  I have to thank Mr. Arthur Grote for a few words more on that
  most interesting subject, the discovery of a real fossil _Ruc_ in
  New Zealand. He informs me (under date 4th December 1874) that
  Professor Owen is now working on the huge bones sent home by Dr.
  Haast, “and is convinced that they belonged to a bird of prey,
  probably (as Dr. Haast suggested) a Harrier, _double the weight of
  the Moa_, and quite capable therefore of preying on the young of
  that species. Indeed, he is disposed to attribute the extinction of
  the Harpagornis to that of the Moa, which was the only victim in
  the country which could supply it with a sufficiency of food.”

  One is tempted to add that if the Moa or Dinornis of New Zealand
  had its _Harpagornis_ scourge, the still greater Aepyornis of
  Madagascar may have had a proportionate tyrant, whose bones (and
  quills?) time may bring to light. And the description given by Sir
  Douglas Forsyth on page 542, of the action of the Golden Eagle of
  Kashgar in dealing with a wild boar, illustrates how such a bird
  as our imagined _Harpagornis Aepyornithōn_ might master the larger
  pachydermata, even the elephant himself, without having to treat
  him precisely as the Persian drawing at p. 415 represents.

  Sindbad’s adventures with the Rukh are too well known for
  quotation. A variety of stories of the same tenor hitherto
  unpublished, have been collected by M. Marcel Devic from an Arabic
  work of the 10th century on the “_Marvels of Hind_,” by an author
  who professes only to repeat the narratives of merchants and
  mariners whom he had questioned. A specimen of these will be found
  under Note 6. The story takes a peculiar form in the Travels of
  Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela. He heard that when ships were in danger
  of being lost in the stormy sea that led to China the sailors were
  wont to sew themselves up in hides, and so when cast upon the
  surface they were snatched up by great eagles called gryphons,
  which carried their supposed prey ashore, etc. It is curious that
  this very story occurs in a Latin poem stated to be _at least_
  as old as the beginning of the 13th century, which relates the
  romantic adventures of a certain Duke Ernest of Bavaria; whilst
  the story embodies more than one other adventure belonging to the
  History of Sindbad.[5] The Duke and his comrades, navigating in
  some unknown ramification of the Euxine, fall within the fatal
  attraction of the Magnet Mountain. Hurried by this augmenting
  force, their ship is described as crashing through the rotten
  forest of masts already drawn to their doom:—

      “Et ferit impulsus majoris verbere montem
       Quam si diplosas impingat machina turres.”

  There they starve, and the dead are deposited on the lofty poop to
  be carried away by the daily visits of the gryphons:—

                  ——“Quae grifae membra leonis
      Et pennas aquilae simulantes unguibus atris
      Tollentes miseranda suis dant prandia pullis.”

  When only the Duke and six others survive, the wisest of the party
  suggests the scheme which Rabbi Benjamin has related:—

                  ——“Quaeramus tergora, et armis
      Vestiti prius, optatis volvamur in illis,
      Ut nos tollentes mentita cadavera Grifae
      Pullis objiciant, a queis facientibus armis
      Et cute dissutâ, nos, si volet, Ille Deorum
      Optimus eripiet.”

  Which scheme is successfully carried out. The wanderers then make
  a raft on which they embark on a river which plunges into a cavern
  in the heart of a mountain; and after a time they emerge in the
  country of Arimaspia inhabited by the Cyclopes; and so on. The
  Gryphon story also appears in the romance of Huon de Bordeaux, as
  well as in the tale called ‘Hasan of el-Basrah’ in Lane’s Version
  of the _Arabian Nights_.

  It is in the China Seas that Ibn Batuta beheld the Rukh, first like
  a mountain in the sea where no mountain should be, and then “when
  the sun rose,” says he, “we saw the mountain aloft in the air, and
  the clear sky between it and the sea. We were in astonishment at
  this, and I observed that the sailors were weeping and bidding each
  other adieu, so I called out, ‘What is the matter?’ They replied,
  ‘What we took for a mountain is “the Rukh.” If it sees us, it will
  send us to destruction.’ It was then some 10 miles from the junk.
  But God Almighty was gracious unto us, and sent us a fair wind,
  which turned us from the direction in which the Rukh was; so we did
  not see him well enough to take cognizance of his real shape.” In
  this story we have evidently a case of abnormal refraction, causing
  an island to appear suspended in the air.[6]

  The Archipelago was perhaps the legitimate habitat of the Rukh,
  before circumstances localised it in the direction of Madagascar.
  In the Indian Sea, says Kazwini, is a bird of size so vast that
  when it is dead men take the half of its bill and make a ship
  of it! And there too Pigafetta heard of this bird, under its
  Hindu name of _Garuda_, so big that it could fly away with an
  elephant.[7] Kazwini also says that the ’Angka carries off an
  elephant as a hawk flies off with a mouse; his flight is like the
  loud thunder. Whilom he dwelt near the haunts of men, and wrought
  them great mischief. But once on a time it had carried off a bride
  in her bridal array, and Hamd Allah, the Prophet of those days,
  invoked a curse upon the bird. Wherefore the Lord banished it to an
  inaccessible Island in the Encircling Ocean.

  The Simurgh or ’Angka, dwelling behind veils of Light and Darkness
  on the inaccessible summits of Caucasus, is in Persian mysticism an
  emblem of the Almighty.

  In Northern Siberia the people have a firm belief in the former
  existence of birds of colossal size, suggested apparently by the
  fossil bones of great pachyderms which are so abundant there. And
  the compressed sabre-like horns of _Rhinoceros tichorinus_ are
  constantly called, even by Russian merchants, _birds’ claws_. Some
  of the native tribes fancy the vaulted skull of the same rhinoceros
  to be the bird’s head, and the leg-bones of other pachyderms to
  be its quills; and they relate that their forefathers used to
  fight wonderful battles with this bird. Erman ingeniously suggests
  that the Herodotean story of the Gryphons, _from under which_ the
  Arimaspians drew their gold, grew out of the legends about these
  fossils.

  I may add that the name of our _rook_ in chess is taken from that
  of this same bird; though first perverted from (Sansk.) _rath_, a
  chariot.

  Some Eastern authors make the _Rukh_ an enormous beast instead
  of a bird. (See _J. R. A. S._ XIII. 64, and _Elliot_, II. 203.)
  A Spanish author of the 16th century seems to take the same view
  of the Gryphon, but he is prudently vague in describing it, which
  he does among the animals of Africa: “The _Grifo which some call_
  CAMELLO PARDAL ... is called by the Arabs _Yfrit_ (!), and is made
  just in that fashion in which we see it painted in pictures.”
  (_Marmol, Descripcion General de Africa_, Granada, 1573, I. f. 30.)
  The _Zorafa_ is described as a different beast, which it certainly
  is!

  [In a letter to Sir Henry Yule, dated 24th March 1887, Sir (then
  Dr.) John Kirk writes: “I was speaking with the present Sultan of
  Zanzibar, Seyyed Barghash, about the great bird which the natives
  say exists, and in doing so I laughed at the idea. His Highness
  turned serious and said that indeed he believed it to be quite true
  that a great bird visited the Udoe country, and that it caused a
  great shadow to fall upon the country; he added that it let fall
  at times large rocks. Of course he did not pretend to know these
  things from his own experience, for he has never been inland, but
  he considered he had ample grounds to believe these stones from
  what he had been told of those who travelled. The Udoe country lies
  north of the River Wami opposite the island of Zanzibar and about
  two days going inland. The people are jealous of strangers and
  practise cannibalism in war. They are therefore little visited, and
  although near the coast we know little of them. The only members
  of their tribe I have known have been converted to Islam, and not
  disposed to say much of their native customs, being ashamed of
  them, while secretly still believing in them. The only thing I
  noticed was an idea that the tribe came originally from the West,
  from about Manyema; now the people of that part are cannibals, and
  cannibalism is almost unknown except among the _Wadoe_, nearer the
  east coast. It is also singular that the other story of a gigantic
  bird comes from near Manyema and that the _whalebone_ that was
  passed off at Zanzibar as the wing of a bird, came, they said, from
  Tanganyika. As to rocks falling in East Africa, I think their idea
  might easily arise from the fall of meteoric stones.”]

  [M. Alfred Grandidier (_Hist. de la Géog. de Madagascar_, p. 31)
  thinks that the Rukh is but an image; it is a personification of
  water-spouts, cyclones, and typhoons.—H. C.]

  NOTE 6.—Sir Thomas Brown says that if any man will say he desires
  before belief to behold such a creature as is the _Rukh_ in
  Paulus Venetus, for his own part he will not be angry with his
  incredulity. But M. Pauthier is of more liberal belief; for he
  considers that, after all, the dimensions which Marco assigns to
  the wings and quills of the Rukh are not so extravagant that we
  should refuse to admit their possibility.

  Ludolf will furnish him with corroborative evidence, that of Padre
  Bolivar, a Jesuit, as communicated to Thévenot; the assigned
  position will suit well enough with Marco’s report: “The bird
  condor differs in size in different parts of the world. The greater
  species was seen by many of the Portuguese in their expedition
  against the Kingdoms of Sofala and Cuama and the Land of the
  Caffres from Monomotapa to the Kingdom of Angola and the Mountains
  of Teroa. In some countries I have myself seen the wing-feathers
  of that enormous fowl, although the bird itself I never beheld.
  The feather in question, as could be deduced from its form, was
  one of the middle ones, and it was 28 palms in length and three in
  breadth. The quill part, from the root to the extremity, was five
  palms in length, of the thickness of an average man’s arm, and of
  extreme strength and hardness. [M. Alfred Grandidier (_Hist. de la
  Géog. de Madagascar_, p. 25) thinks that the quill part of this
  feather was one of the bamboo shoots formerly brought to Yemen to
  be used as water-jars and called there _feathers of Rukh_, the
  Arabs looking upon these bamboo shoots as the quill part of the
  feathers of the Rukh.—H. C.] The fibres of the feather were equal
  in length and closely fitted, so that they could scarcely be parted
  without some exertion of force; and they were jet black, whilst
  the quill part was white. Those who had seen the bird stated that
  it was bigger than the bulk of a couple of elephants, and that
  hitherto nobody had succeeded in killing one. It rises to the
  clouds with such extraordinary swiftness that it seems scarcely
  to stir its wings. _In form it is like an eagle_. But although
  its size and swiftness are so extraordinary, it has much trouble
  in procuring food, on account of the density of the forests with
  which all that region is clothed. Its own dwelling is in cold and
  desolate tracts such as the Mountains of Teroa, _i.e._ of the
  Moon; and in the valleys of that range it shows itself at certain
  periods. Its black feathers are held in very high estimation, and
  it is with the greatest difficulty that one can be got from the
  natives, for _one_ such serves to fan ten people, and to keep
  off the terrible heat from them, as well as the wasps and flies”
  (_Ludolf, Hist. Aethiop._ Comment. p. 164.)

  Abu Mahomed, of Spain, relates that a merchant arrived in Barbary
  who had lived long among the Chinese. He had with him the quill of
  a chick Rukh, and this held nine skins of water. He related the
  story of how he came by this,—a story nearly the same as one of
  Sindbad’s about the Rukh’s egg. (_Bochart_, II. 854.)

  Another story of a seaman wrecked on the coast of Africa is among
  those collected by M. Marcel Devic. By a hut that stood in the
  middle of a field of rice and _durra_ there was a trough. “A man
  came up leading a pair of oxen, laden with 12 skins of water, and
  emptied these into the trough. I drew near to drink, and found the
  trough to be polished like a steel blade, quite different from
  either glass or pottery. ‘It is the hollow of a quill,’ said the
  man. I would not believe a word of the sort, until, after rubbing
  it inside and outside, I found it to be transparent, and to retain
  the traces of the barbs.” (_Comptes Rendus_, _etc._, _ut supra_;
  and _Livre des Merveilles de l’Inde_, p. 99.)

  Fr. Jordanus also says: “In this _India Tertia_ (Eastern Africa)
  are certain birds which are called _Roc_, so big that they easily
  carry an elephant up into the air. I have seen a certain person who
  said that he had seen one of those birds, one wing only of which
  stretched to a length of 80 palms” (p. 42).

  The Japanese Encyclopædia states that in the country of the
  _Tsengsz’_ (Zinjis) in the South-West Ocean, there is a bird called
  _pheng_, which in its flight eclipses the sun. It can swallow a
  camel; and its quills are used for water-casks. This was probably
  got from the Arabs. (_J. As._, sér. 2, tom. xii. 235–236.)

  I should note that the _Geog. Text_ in the first passage where
  the feathers are spoken of says: “_e ce qe je en vi voz dirai en
  autre leu, por ce qe il convient ensi faire à nostre livre_,”—“that
  which _I have seen_ of them I will tell you elsewhere, as it suits
  the arrangement of our book.” No such other detail is found in
  that text, but we have in Ramusio this passage about the quill
  brought to the Great Kaan, and I suspect that the phrase, “as I
  have heard,” is an interpolation, and that Polo is here telling _ce
  qe il en vit_. What are we to make of the story? I have sometimes
  thought that possibly some vegetable production, such as a great
  frond of the _Ravenala_, may have been cooked to pass as a Rukh’s
  quill. [See _App._ L.]

  NOTE 7.—The giraffes are an error. The _Eng. Cyc._ says that wild
  asses and zebras (?) do exist in Madagascar, but I cannot trace
  authority for this.

  The great boar’s teeth were indubitably hippopotamus-teeth, which
  form a considerable article of export from Zanzibar[8] (not
  Madagascar). Burton speaks of their reaching 12 lbs in weight. And
  Cosmas tells us: “The hippopotamus I have not seen indeed, but I
  had some great teeth of his _that weighed thirteen pounds_, which
  I sold here (in Alexandria). And I have seen many such teeth in
  Ethiopia and in Egypt.” (See _J. R. G. S._ XXIX. 444; _Cathay_, p.
  clxxv.)

    Zinj population of the island, about the beginning of the Abasside

    of windmills; whilst the surrounding islands (especially at their

                            CHAPTER XXXIV.

    CONCERNING THE ISLAND OF ZANGHIBAR. A WORD ON INDIA IN GENERAL.


Zanghibar is a great and noble Island, with a compass of some 2000
miles.{1} The people are all Idolaters, and have a king and a language
of their own, and pay tribute to nobody. They are both tall and stout,
but not tall in proportion to their stoutness, for if they were, being
so stout and brawny, they would be absolutely like giants; and they are
so strong that they will carry for four men and eat for five.

They are all black, and go stark naked, with only a little covering
for decency. Their hair is as black as pepper, and so frizzly that
even with water you can scarcely straighten it. And their mouths are
so large, their noses so turned up, their lips so thick, their eyes so
big and bloodshot, that they look like very devils; they are in fact so
hideously ugly that the world has nothing to show more horrible.

Elephants are produced in this country in wonderful profusion. There
are also lions that are black and quite different from ours. And their
sheep and wethers are all exactly alike in colour; the body all white
and the head black; no other kind of sheep is found there, you may rest
assured.{2} They have also many giraffes. This is a beautiful creature,
and I must give you a description of it. Its body is short and somewhat
sloped to the rear, for its hind legs are short whilst the fore-legs
and the neck are both very long, and thus its head stands about three
paces from the ground. The head is small, and the animal is not at all
mischievous. Its colour is all red and white in round spots, and it is
really a beautiful object.{3}

** The women of this Island are the ugliest in the world, with their
great mouths and big eyes and thick noses; their breasts too are four
times bigger than those of any other women; a very disgusting sight.

The people live on rice and flesh and milk and dates; and they make
wine of dates and of rice and of good spices and sugar. There is a
great deal of trade, and many merchants and vessels go thither. But
the staple trade of the Island is in elephants’ teeth, which are very
abundant; and they have also much ambergris, as whales are plentiful.{4}

They have among them excellent and valiant warriors, and have little
fear of death. They have no horses, but fight mounted on camels and
elephants. On the latter they set wooden castles which carry from ten
to sixteen persons, armed with lances, swords, and stones, so that
they fight to great purpose from these castles. They wear no armour,
but carry only a shield of hide, besides their swords and lances, and
so a marvellous number of them fall in battle. When they are going to
take an elephant into battle they ply him well with their wine, so that
he is made half drunk. They do this because the drink makes him more
fierce and bold, and of more service in battle.{5}

As there is no more to say on this subject I will go on to tell you
about the Great Province of ABASH, which constitutes the MIDDLE
INDIA;—but I must first say something about India in general.

You must understand that in speaking of the Indian Islands we have
described only the most noble provinces and kingdoms among them; for no
man on earth could give you a true account of the whole of the Islands
of India. Still, what I have described are the best, and as it were the
Flower of the Indies. For the greater part of the other Indian Islands
that I have omitted are subject to those that I have described. It is
a fact that in this Sea of India there are 12,700 Islands, inhabited
and uninhabited, according to the charts and documents of experienced
mariners who navigate that Indian Sea.{6}

INDIA THE GREATER is that which extends from Maabar to Kesmacoran; and
it contains 13 great kingdoms, of which we have described ten. These
are all on the mainland.

INDIA THE LESSER extends from the Province of Champa to Mutfili, and
contains eight great kingdoms. These are likewise all on the mainland.
And neither of these numbers includes the Islands, among which also
there are very numerous kingdoms, as I have told you.{7}


  NOTE 1.—ZANGIBAR, “the Region of the Blacks,” known to the ancients
  as _Zingis_ and _Zingium_. The name was applied by the Arabs,
  according to De Barros, to the whole stretch of coast from the
  Kilimanchi River, which seems to be the Jubb, to Cape Corrientes
  beyond the Southern Tropic, _i.e._ as far as Arab traffic extended;
  Burton says now from the Jubb to Cape Delgado. According to
  Abulfeda, the King of Zinjis dwelt at Mombasa. In recent times the
  name is by Europeans almost appropriated to the Island on which
  resides the Sultan of the Maskat family, to whom Sir B. Frere
  lately went as envoy. Our author’s “Island” has no reference to
  this; it is an error simply.

  Our traveller’s information is here, I think, certainly at second
  hand, though no doubt he had seen the negroes whom he describes
  with such disgust, and apparently the sheep and the giraffes.

  NOTE 2.—These sheep are common at Aden, whither they are imported
  from the opposite African coast. They have hair like smooth goats,
  no wool. Varthema also describes them (p. 87). In the Cairo Museum,
  among ornaments found in the mummy-pits, there is a little figure
  of one of these sheep, the head and neck in some blue stone and the
  body in white agate. (_Note by Author of the sketch on next page._)

  NOTE 3.—A giraffe—made into a _seraph_ by the Italians—had been
  frequently seen in Italy in the early part of the century, there
  being one in the train of the Emperor Frederic II. Another was sent
  by Bibars to the Imperial Court in 1261, and several to Barka Khan
  at Sarai in 1263; whilst the King of Nubia was bound by treaty in
  1275 to deliver to the Sultan three elephants, three giraffes, and
  five she-panthers. (_Kington_, I. 471; _Makrizi_, I. 216; II. 106,
  108.) The giraffe is sometimes wrought in the patterns of mediæval
  Saracenic damasks, and in Sicilian ones imitated from the former.
  Of these there are examples in the Kensington Collection.

  I here omit a passage about the elephant. It recounts an old and
  long-persistent fable, exploded by Sir T. Brown, and indeed before
  him by the sensible Garcia de Orta.

  NOTE 4.—The port of Zanzibar is probably the chief ivory mart in
  the world. Ambergris is mentioned by Burton among miscellaneous
  exports, but it is not now of any consequence. Owen speaks of it as
  brought for sale at Delagoa Bay in the south.

  NOTE 5.—Mas’udi more correctly says: “The country abounds with wild
  elephants, but you don’t find a single tame one. The Zinjes employ
  them neither in war nor otherwise, and if they hunt them ’tis only
  to kill them” (III. 7). It is difficult to conceive how Marco could
  have got so much false information. The only beast of burden in
  Zanzibar, at least north of Mozambique, is the ass. His particulars
  seem jumbled from various parts of Africa. The camel-riders suggest
  the _Bejas_ of the Red Sea coast, of whom there were in Mas’udi’s
  time 30,000 warriors so mounted, and armed with lances and bucklers
  (III. 34). The elephant stories may have arisen from the occasional
  use of these animals by the Kings of Abyssinia. (See Note 4 to next
  chapter.)

  [Illustration: Ethiopian Sheep.]

  NOTE 6.—An approximation to 12,000 as a round number seems to have
  been habitually used in reference to the Indian Islands; John of
  Montecorvino says they are many more than 12,000; Jordanus had
  heard that there were 10,000 _inhabited_. Linschoten says some
  estimated the Maldives at 11,100. And we learn from Pyrard de Laval
  that the Sultan of the Maldives called himself Ibrahim Sultan of
  Thirteen Atollons (or coral groups) and of 12,000 Islands! This is
  probably the origin of the proverbial number. Ibn Batuta, in his
  excellent account of the Maldives, estimates them at only about
  2000. But Captain Owen, commenting on Pyrard, says that he believes
  the actual number of islands to be treble or fourfold of 12,000.
  (_P. de Laval_ in _Charton_, IV. 255; _I. B._ IV. 40; _J. R. G. S._
  II. 84.)

  NOTE 7.—The term “India” became very vague from an early date. In
  fact, Alcuin divides the whole world into three parts, Europe,
  Africa, and India. Hence it was necessary to discriminate different
  Indias, but there is very little agreement among different authors
  as to this discrimination.

  The earliest use that I can find of the terms India Major and Minor
  is in the _Liber Junioris Philosophi_ published by Hudson, and
  which is believed to be translated from a lost Greek original of
  the middle of the 4th century. In this author India Minor adjoins
  Persia. So it does with Friar Jordanus. His India Minor appears to
  embrace Sind (possibly Mekran), and the western coast exclusive of
  Malabar. India Major extends from Malabar indefinitely eastward.
  His _India Tertia_ is Zanjibar. The Three Indies appear in a map
  contained in a MS. by Guido Pisanus, written in 1118. Conti
  divides India into three: (1) From Persia to the Indus (_i.e._
  Mekran and Sind); (2) From the Indus to the Ganges; (3) All that is
  beyond Ganges (Indo-China and China).

  In a map of Andrea Bianco at Venice (No. 12) the divisions are—(1)
  India Minor, extending westward to the Persian Gulf; (2) India
  Media, “containing 14 regions and 12 nations;” and (3) India
  Superior, containing 8 regions and 24 nations.

  Marino Sanuto places immediately east of the Persian Gulf “India
  Minor _quae et Ethiopia_.”

  John Marignolli again has three Indias: (1) Manzi or India Maxima
  (S. China); (2) Mynibar (Malabar); (3) Maabar. The last two with
  Guzerat are Abulfeda’s divisions, exclusive of Sind.

  We see that there was a traditional tendency to make out _Three
  Indies_, but little concord as to their identity. With regard
  to the expressions _Greater_ and _Lesser_ India, I would recall
  attention to what has been said about Greater and Lesser Java
  (_supra_, chap. ix. note 1). Greater India was originally intended,
  I imagine, for the _real_ India, what our maps call Hindustan. And
  the threefold division, with its inclination to place one of the
  Indies in Africa, I think may have originated with the Arab _Hind_,
  _Sind_, and _Zinj_. I may add that our vernacular expression “the
  Indies” is itself a vestige of the twofold or threefold division of
  which we have been speaking.

  The partition of the Indies made by King Sebastian of Portugal
  in 1571, when he constituted his eastern possessions into three
  governments, recalled the old division into Three Indias. The
  first, INDIA, extending from Cape Gardafui to Ceylon, stood in a
  general way for Polo’s India Major; the second MONOMOTAPA, from
  Gardafui to Cape Corrientes (India Tertia of Jordanus); the third
  MALACCA, from Pegu to China (India Minor). (_Faria y Souza_, II.
  319.)

  Polo’s knowledge of India, _as a whole_, is so little exact
  that it is too indefinite a problem to consider which are the
  three kingdoms that he has _not_ described. The ten which he has
  described appear to be—(1) Maabar, (2) Coilum, (3) Comari, (4) Eli,
  (5) Malabar, (6) Guzerat, (7) Tana, (8) Canbaet, (9) Semenat, (10)
  Kesmacoran. On the one hand, this distribution in itself contains
  serious misapprehensions, as we have seen, and on the other there
  must have been many dozens of kingdoms in India Major instead
  of 13, if such states as Comari, Hili, and Somnath were to be
  separately counted. Probably it was a common saying that there were
  12 kings in India, and the fact of his having himself described
  so many, which he knew did not nearly embrace the whole, may have
  made Polo convert this into 13. Jordanus says: “In this Greater
  India are 12 idolatrous kings and more;” but his Greater India is
  much more extensive than Polo’s. Those which he names are _Molebar_
  (probably the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut), _Singuyli_
  (Cranganor), _Columbum_ (Quilon), _Molephatan_ (on the east
  coast, uncertain, see above pp. 333, 391), and _Sylen_ (Ceylon),
  _Java_, three or four kings, _Telenc_ (Polo’s Mutfili), _Maratha_
  (Deogir), _Batigala_ (in Canara), and in _Champa_ (apparently put
  for all Indo-China) many kings. According to Firishta there were
  about a dozen _important_ principalities in India at the time of
  the Mahomedan conquest of which he mentions _eleven_, viz.: (1)
  _Kanauj_, (2) _Mírat_ (or Delhi), (3) _Mahávan_ (Mathra), (4)
  _Lahore_, (5) _Malwa_, (6) _Guzerat_, (7) _Ajmir_, (8) _Gwalior_,
  (9) _Kalinjar_, (10) _Multán_, (11) _Ujjain_. (_Ritter_, V.
  535.) This omits Bengal, Orissa, and all the Deccan. _Twelve_ is
  a round number which constantly occurs in such statements. Ibn
  Batuta tells us there were 12 princes in Malabar alone. Chinghiz,
  in Sanang-Setzen, speaks of his vow to subdue the _twelve_ kings
  of the human race (91). Certain figures in a temple at Anhilwara
  in Guzerat are said by local tradition to be the effigies of the
  _twelve_ great kings of Europe. (_Todd’s Travels_, p. 107.) The
  King of Arakan used to take the title of “Lord of the 12 provinces
  of Bengal” (_Reinaud, Inde_, p. 139.)

  The _Masálak-al-Absár_ of Shihabuddin Dimishki, written some
  forty years after Polo’s book, gives a list of the provinces
  (twice twelve in number) into which India was then considered to
  be divided. It runs—(1) _Delhi_, (2) _Deogír_, (3) _Multán_, (4)
  _Kehran_ (_Kohrám_, in Sirhind Division of Province of Delhi?),
  (5) _Sámán_ (Samána, N.W. of Delhi?), (6) _Siwastán_ (Sehwán),
  (7) _Ujah_ (Uchh), (8) _Hási_ (Hansi), (9) _Sarsati_ (Sirsa),
  (10) _Ma’bar_, (11) _Tiling_, (12) _Gujerat_, (13) _Badáún_,
  (14) _Audh_, (15) _Kanauj_, (16) _Laknaoti_ (Upper Bengal), (17)
  _Bahár_, (18) _Karráh_ (in the Doáb), (19) _Maláwa_, (Málwa),
  (20) _Lahaur_, (21) _Kálánúr_ (in the Bári Doáb, above Lahore),
  (22) _Jájnagar_ (according to Elphinstone, Tipura in Bengal),
  (23) _Tilinj_ (a repetition or error), (24) _Dursamand_ (Dwara
  Samudra, the kingdom of the Belláls in Mysore). Neither Malabar nor
  Orissa is accounted for. (See _Not. et Ext._ XIII. 170). Another
  list, given by the historian Zíá-uddín Barni some years later,
  embraces again only _twelve_ provinces. These are (1) Delhi, (2)
  Gujerat, (3) Málwah, (4) Deogír, (5) Tiling, (6) Kampilah (in the
  Doáb, between Koil and Farakhábád), (7) Dur Samandar, (8) Ma’bar,
  (9) _Tirhut_, (10) Lakhnaoti, (11) _Satgánw_, (12) _Sunárgánw_
  (these two last forming the Western and Eastern portions of Lower
  Bengal).[1]

                             CHAPTER XXXV.

    TREATING OF THE GREAT PROVINCE OF ABASH WHICH IS MIDDLE INDIA,
                        AND IS ON THE MAINLAND.


Abash is a very great Province, and you must know that it constitutes
the MIDDLE INDIA; and it is on the mainland. There are in it six great
Kings with six great Kingdoms; and of these six Kings there are three
that are Christians and three that are Saracens; but the greatest of
all the six is a Christian, and all the others are subject to him.{1}

The Christians in this country bear three marks on the face;{2} one
from the forehead to the middle of the nose, and one on either cheek.
These marks are made with a hot iron, and form part of their baptism;
for after that they have been baptised with water, these three marks
are made, partly as a token of gentility, and partly as the completion
of their baptism. There are also Jews in the country, and these bear
two marks, one on either cheek; and the Saracens have but one, to wit,
on the forehead extending halfway down the nose.

The Great King lives in the middle of the country, the Saracens towards
Aden. St. Thomas the Apostle preached in this region, and after he had
converted the people he went away to the province of Maabar, where he
died; and there his body lies, as I have told you in a former place.

The people here are excellent soldiers, and they go on horseback, for
they have horses in plenty. Well they may; for they are in daily war
with the Soldan of ADEN, and with the Nubians, and a variety of other
nations.{3} I will tell you a famous story of what befel in the year
of Christ, 1288.

You must know that this Christian King, who is the Lord of the Province
of Abash, declared his intention to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem to
adore the Holy Sepulchre of Our Lord God Jesus Christ the Saviour. But
his Barons said that for him to go in person would be to run too great
a risk; and they recommended him to send some bishop or prelate in his
stead. So the King assented to the counsel which his Barons gave, and
despatched a certain Bishop of his, a man of very holy life. The Bishop
then departed and travelled by land and by sea till he arrived at the
Holy Sepulchre, and there he paid it such honour as Christian man is
bound to do, and presented a great offering on the part of his King who
had sent him in his own stead.

And when he had done all that behoved him, he set out again and
travelled day by day till he got to Aden. Now that is a Kingdom
wherein Christians are held in great detestation, for the people are
all Saracens, and their enemies unto the death. So when the Soldan of
Aden heard that this man was a Christian and a Bishop, and an envoy of
the Great King of Abash, he had him seized and demanded of him if he
were a Christian? To this the Bishop replied that he was a Christian
indeed. The Soldan then told him that unless he would turn to the Law
of Mahommet he should work him great shame and dishonour. The Bishop
answered that they might kill him ere he would deny his Creator.

When the Soldan heard that he waxed wroth, and ordered that the Bishop
should be circumcised. So they took and circumcised him after the
manner of the Saracens. And then the Soldan told him that he had been
thus put to shame in despite to the King his master. And so they let
him go.

The Bishop was sorely cut to the heart for the shame that had been
wrought him, but he took comfort because it had befallen him in holding
fast by the Law of Our Lord Jesus Christ; and the Lord God would
recompense his soul in the world to come.

So when he was healed he set out and travelled by land and by sea till
he reached the King his Lord in the Kingdom of Abash. And when the King
beheld him, he welcomed him with great joy and gladness. And he asked
him all about the Holy Sepulchre; and the Bishop related all about
it truly, the King listening the while as to a most holy matter in
all faith. But when the Bishop had told all about Jerusalem, he then
related the outrage done on him by the Soldan of Aden in the King’s
despite. Great was the King’s wrath and grief when he heard that; and
it so disturbed him that he was like to die of vexation. And at length
his words waxed so loud that all those round about could hear what he
was saying. He vowed that he would never wear crown or hold kingdom if
he took not such condign vengeance on the Soldan of Aden that all the
world should ring therewithal, even until the insult had been well and
thoroughly redressed.

And what shall I say of it? He straightway caused the array of his
horse and foot to be mustered, and great numbers of elephants with
castles to be prepared to accompany them;{4} and when all was ready
he set out with his army and advanced till he entered the Kingdom of
Aden in great force. The Kings of this province of Aden were well aware
of the King’s advance against them, and went to encounter him at the
strongest pass on their frontier, with a great force of armed men, in
order to bar the enemy from entering their territory. When the King
arrived at this strong pass where the Saracens had taken post, a battle
began, fierce and fell on both sides, for they were very bitter against
each other. But it came to pass, as it pleased our Lord God Jesus
Christ, that the Kings of the Saracens, who were three in number, could
not stand against the Christians, for they are not such good soldiers
as the Christians are. So the Saracens were defeated, and a marvellous
number of them slain, and the King of Abash entered the Kingdom of Aden
with all his host. The Saracens made various sallies on them in the
narrow defiles, but it availed nothing; they were always beaten and
slain. And when the King had greatly wasted and destroyed the kingdom
of his enemy, and had remained in it more than a month with all his
host, continually slaying the Saracens, and ravaging their lands (so
that great numbers of them perished), he thought it time to return to
his own kingdom, which he could now do with great honour. Indeed he
could tarry no longer, nor could he, as he was aware, do more injury
to the enemy; for he would have had to force a way by still stronger
passes, where, in the narrow defiles, a handful of men might cause him
heavy loss. So he quitted the enemy’s Kingdom of Aden and began to
retire. And he with his host got back to their own country of Abash in
great triumph and rejoicing; for he had well avenged the shame cast
on him and on his Bishop for his sake. For they had slain so many
Saracens, and so wasted and harried the land, that ’twas something to
be astonished at. And in sooth ’twas a deed well done! For it is not to
be borne that the dogs of Saracens should lord it over good Christian
people! Now you have heard the story.{5}

I have still some particulars to tell you of the same province. It
abounds greatly in all kinds of victual; and the people live on flesh
and rice and milk and sesame. They have plenty of elephants, not that
they are bred in the country, but they are brought from the Islands of
the other India. They have however many giraffes, which are produced
in the country; besides bears, leopards, lions in abundance, and many
other passing strange beasts. They have also numerous wild asses; and
cocks and hens the most beautiful that exist, and many other kind of
birds. For instance, they have ostriches that are nearly as big as
asses; and plenty of beautiful parrots, with apes of sundry kinds, and
baboons and other monkeys that have countenances all but human.{6}

There are numerous cities and villages in this province of Abash, and
many merchants; for there is much trade to be done there. The people
also manufacture very fine buckrams and other cloths of cotton.

There is no more to say on the subject; so now let us go forward and
tell you of the province of Aden.


  NOTE 1.—_Abash_ (Abasce) is a close enough representation of the
  Arabic _Ḥabsh_ or _Ḥabash_, _i.e._ Abyssinia. He gives as an
  alternative title _Middle_ India. I am not aware that the term
  India is applied to Abyssinia by any Oriental (Arabic or Persian)
  writer, and one feels curious to know where our Traveller got the
  appellation. We find nearly the same application of the term in
  Benjamin of Tudela:

  “Eight days from thence is Middle India, which is Aden, and in
  Scripture Eden in Thelasar. This country is very mountainous, and
  contains many independent Jews who are not subject to the power
  of the Gentiles, but possess cities and fortresses on the summits
  of the mountains, from whence they descend into the country of
  Maatum, with which they are at war. Maatum, called also Nubia, is
  a Christian kingdom and the inhabitants are called Nubians,” etc.
  (p. 117). Here the Rabbi seems to transfer Aden to the west of the
  Red Sea (as Polo also seems to do in this chapter); for the Jews
  warring against Nubian Christians must be sought in the Falasha
  strongholds among the mountains of Abyssinia. His Middle India is
  therefore the same as Polo’s or nearly so. In Jordanus, as already
  mentioned, we have _India Tertia_, which combines some characters
  of Abyssinia and Zanjibar, but is distinguished from the Ethiopia
  of Prester John, which adjoins it.

  But for the occurrence of the name in R. Benjamin I should have
  supposed the use of it to have been of European origin and
  current at most among Oriental Christians and Frank merchants. The
  _European_ confusion of India and Ethiopia comes down from Virgil’s
  time, who brings the Nile from India. And Servius (4th century)
  commenting on a more ambiguous passage—

          ——“_Sola India nigrum
      Fert ebenum_,”

  says explicitly “_Indiam omnem plagam Æthiopiæ accipimus_.”
  Procopius brings the Nile into Egypt ἐξ Ἰνδῶν; and the
  Ecclesiastical Historians Sozomen and Socrates (I take these
  citations, like the last, from Ludolf), in relating the conversion
  of the Abyssinians by Frumentius, speak of them only as of the
  Ἰνδῶν τῶν ἐνδοτέρω, “Interior Indians,” a phrase intended to imply
  _remoter_, but which might perhaps give rise to the term _Middle
  India_. Thus Cosmas says of China: “ἧς ἐνδοτέρω, there is no other
  country”; and Nicolo Conti calls the Chinese _Interiores Indi_,
  which Mr. Winter Jones misrenders “natives of Central India.”[1]
  St. Epiphanius (end of 4th century) says _India_ was formerly
  divided into nine kingdoms, viz., those of the (1) _Alabastri_,
  (2) _Homeritae_, (3) _Azumiti_, and _Dulites_, (4) _Bugaei_, (5)
  _Taiani_, (6) _Isabeni_, and so on, several of which are manifestly
  provinces subject to Abyssinia.[2] Roger Bacon speaks of the
  “Ethiopes de Nubiâ et ultimi illi _qui vocantur Indi, propter
  approximationem ad Indiam_.” The term _India Minor_ is applied to
  some Ethiopic region in a letter which Matthew Paris gives under
  1237. And this confusion which prevailed more or less till the 16th
  century was at the bottom of that other confusion, whatever be its
  exact history, between Prester John in remote Asia, and Prester
  John in Abyssinia. In fact the narrative by Damian de Goës of the
  Embassy from the King of Abyssinia to Portugal in 1513, which
  was printed at Antwerp in 1532, bears the title “_Legatio Magni_
  Indorum _Imperatoris_,” etc. (_Ludolf, Comment._ p. 2 and 75–76;
  _Epiph. de Gemmis_, etc., p. 15; _R. Bacon, Opus Majus_, p. 148;
  _Matt. Paris_, p. 372.)

  Wadding gives a letter from the Pope (Alex. II.) under date 3rd
  Sept. 1329, addressed to the _Emperor of Ethiopia_, to inform him
  of the appointment of a Bishop of Diagorgan. As this place is
  the capital of a district near Tabriz (Dehi-Khorkhán); the papal
  geography looks a little hazy.

  NOTE 2.—The allegation against the Abyssinian Christians, sometimes
  extended to the whole Jacobite Church, that they accompanied the
  rite of Baptism by branding with a hot iron on the face, is pretty
  old and persistent.

  The letter quoted from Matt. Paris in the preceding note relates
  of the Jacobite Christians “who occupy the kingdoms between Nubia
  and India,” that some of them brand the foreheads of their children
  before Baptism with a hot iron (p. 302). A quaint Low-German
  account of the East, in a MS. of the 14th century, tells of the
  Christians of India that when a Bishop ordains a priest he fires
  him with a sharp and hot iron from the forehead down the nose,
  and the scar of this wound abides till the day of his death. And
  this they do for a token that the Holy Ghost came on the Apostles
  with fire. Frescobaldi says those called the Christians of the
  Girdle were the sect which baptized by branding on the head and
  temples. Clavijo says there is such a sect among the Christians
  of India, but they are despised by the rest. Barbosa, speaking
  of the Abyssinians, has this passage: “According to what is
  said, their baptism is threefold, viz., by blood, by fire, and
  by water. For they use circumcision like the Jews, they brand on
  the forehead with a hot iron, and they baptize with water like
  Catholic Christians.” The respectable Pierre Belon speaks of the
  Christians of Prester John, called Abyssinians, as baptized with
  fire and branded in three places, _i.e._ between the eyes and on
  either cheek. Linschoten repeats the like, and one of his plates
  is entitled _Habitus Abissinorum quibus loco Baptismatis frons
  inuritur_. Ariosto, referring to the Emperor of Ethiopia, has:—

      “_Gli è, s’io non piglio errore, in questo loco
       Ove al battesimo loro usano il fuoco._”

  As late as 1819 the traveller Dupré published the same statement
  about the Jacobites generally. And so sober and learned a man as
  Assemani, himself an Oriental, says: “Æthiopes vero, seu Abissini,
  praeter circumcisionem adhibent etiam ferrum candens, quo pueris
  notam inurunt.”

  Yet Ludolf’s Abyssinian friend, Abba Gregory, denied that there
  was any such practice among them. Ludolf says it is the custom of
  various African tribes, both Pagan and Mussulman, to cauterize
  their children in the veins of the temples, in order to inure them
  against colds, and that this, being practised by some Abyssinians,
  was taken for a religious rite. In spite of the terms “Pagan and
  Mussulman,” I suspect that Herodotus was the authority for this
  practice. He states that many of the nomad Libyans, when their
  children reached the age of four, used to burn the veins at the top
  of the head with a flock of wool; others burned the veins about
  the temples. And this they did, he says, to prevent their being
  troubled with rheum in after life.

  Indeed Andrea Corsali denies that the branding had aught to do
  with baptism, “but only to observe Solomon’s custom of marking
  his slaves, the King of Ethiopia claiming to be descended from
  him.” And it is remarkable that Salt mentions that most of the
  people of Dixan had a cross marked (_i.e._ branded) on the breast,
  right arm, or forehead. This he elsewhere explains as a mark of
  their attachment to the ancient metropolitan church of Axum, and
  he supposes that such a practice may have originated the stories
  of fire-baptism. And we find it stated in Marino Sanudo that
  “some of the Jacobites and Syrians _who had crosses branded on
  them_ said this was done for the destruction of the Pagans, and
  out of reverence to the Holy Rood.” Matthew Paris, commenting on
  the letter quoted above, says that many of the Jacobites _before
  baptism_ brand their children on the forehead with a hot iron,
  whilst others brand a cross upon the cheeks or temples. He had seen
  such marks also on the arms of both Jacobites and Syrians who dwelt
  among the Saracens. It is clear, from Salt, that such branding
  _was_ practised by many Abyssinians, and that to a recent date,
  though it may have been entirely detached from baptism. A similar
  practice is followed at Dwárika and Koteswar (on the old Indus
  mouth, now called Lakpat River), where the Hindu pilgrims to these
  sacred sites are branded with the mark of the god.

  NOTE 3.—It is pretty clear from what follows (as Marsden and others
  have noted) that the narrative requires us to conceive of the
  Sultan of Aden as dominant over the territory between Abyssinia and
  the sea, or what was in former days called ADEL, between which and
  _Aden_ confusion seems to have been made. I have noticed in Note 1
  the appearance of this confusion in R. Benjamin; and I may add that
  also in the Map of Marino Sanudo Aden is represented on the western
  shore of the Red Sea. But is it not possible that in the origin of
  the Mahomedan States of Adel the Sultan of Aden had some power over
  them? For we find in the account of the correspondence between the
  King of Abyssinia and Sultan Bibars, quoted in the next Note but
  one, that the Abyssinian letters and presents for Egypt were sent
  to the Sultan of Yemen or Aden to be forwarded.

  NOTE 4.—This passage is not authoritative enough to justify us
  in believing that the mediæval Abyssinians or Nubians did use
  elephants in war, for Marco has already erred in ascribing that
  practice to the Blacks of Zanjibar.

  There can indeed be no doubt that elephants from the countries
  on the west of the Red Sea were caught and tamed and used for
  war, systematically and on a great scale, by the second and third
  Ptolemies, and the latter (Euergetes) has commemorated this, and
  his own use of _Troglodytic_ and _Ethiopic_ elephants, and the
  fact of their encountering the elephants of India, in the Adulitic
  Inscription recorded by Cosmas.

  This author however, who wrote about A.D. 545, and had been at the
  Court of Axum, then in its greatest prosperity, says distinctly:
  “The Ethiopians do not understand the art of taming elephants;
  but if their King should want one or two for show they catch them
  young, and bring them up in captivity.” Hence, when we find a few
  years later (A.D. 570) that there was one great elephant, and some
  say _thirteen_ elephants,[3] employed in the army which Abraha, the
  Abyssinian Ruler of Yemen led against Mecca, an expedition famous
  in Arabian history as the War of the Elephant, we are disposed to
  believe that these must have been elephants imported from India.
  There is indeed a notable statement quoted by Ritter, which if
  trustworthy would lead to another conclusion: “Already in the 20th
  year of the Hijra (A.D. 641) had the _Nubas_ and _Bejas_ hastened
  to the help of the Greek Christians of Oxyrhynchus (_Bahnasa_ of
  the Arabs) ... against the first invasion of the Mahommedans,
  and according to the exaggerated representations of the Arabian
  Annalists, the army which they brought consisted of 50,000 men and
  1300 _war-elephants_.”[4] The Nubians certainly must have tamed
  elephants _on some scale_ down to a late period in the Middle Ages,
  for elephants,—in one case three annually,—formed a frequent part
  of the tribute paid by Nubia to the Mahomedan sovereigns of Egypt
  at least to the end of the 13th century; but the passage quoted
  is too isolated to be accepted without corroboration. The only
  approach to such a corroboration that I know of is a statement by
  Poggio in the matter appended to his account of Conti’s Travels. He
  there repeats some information derived from the Abyssinian envoys
  who visited Pope Eugenius IV. about 1440, and one of his notes
  is: “They have elephants very large and in great numbers; some
  kept for ostentation or pleasure, some as useful in war. They are
  hunted; the old ones killed, the young ones taken and tamed.” But
  the facts on which this was founded probably amounted to no more
  than what Cosmas had stated. I believe no trustworthy authority
  since the Portuguese discoveries confirms the use of the elephant
  in Abyssinia;[5] and Ludolf, whose information was excellent,
  distinctly says that the Abyssinians did not tame them. (_Cathay_,
  p. clxxxi.; _Quat., Mém. sur l’Égypte_, II. 98, 113; _India in
  XVth Century_, 37; _Ludolf_, I. 10, 32; _Armandi, H. Militaire des
  Éléphants_, p. 548.)

  NOTE 5.—To the 10th century at least the whole coast country of the
  Red Sea, from near Berbera probably to Suákin, was still subject
  to Abyssinia. At this time we hear only of “Musalman families”
  residing in Zaila’ and the other ports, and tributary to the
  Christians (see _Mas’udi_, III. 34).

  According to Bruce’s abstract of the Abyssinian chronicles, the
  royal line was superseded in the 10th century by Falasha Jews,
  then by other Christian families, and three centuries of weakness
  and disorder succeeded. In 1268, according to Bruce’s chronology,
  Icon Amlac of the House of Solomon, which had continued to rule in
  Shoa, regained the empire, and was followed by seven other princes
  whose reigns come down to 1312. The history of this period is very
  obscure, but Bruce gathers that it was marked by civil wars, during
  which the Mahomedan communities that had by this time grown up
  in the coast-country became powerful and expelled the Abyssinians
  from the sea-ports. Inland provinces of the low country also, such
  as Ifat and Dawaro, had fallen under Mahomedan governors, whose
  allegiance to the Negush, if not renounced, had become nominal.

  One of the principal Mahomedan communities was called _Adel_, the
  name, according to modern explanation, of the tribes now called
  Danákíl. The capital of the Sultan of Adel was, according to Bruce
  at Aussa, some distance inland from the port of Zaila’, which also
  belonged to Adel.

  Amda Zion, who succeeded to the Abyssinian throne, according to
  Bruce’s chronology, in 1312, two or three years later, provoked
  by the Governor of Ifat, who had robbed and murdered one of his
  Mahomedan agents in the Lowlands, descended on Ifat, inflicted
  severe chastisement on the offenders, and removed the governor. A
  confederacy was then formed against the Abyssinian King by several
  of the Mahomedan States or chieftainships, among which Adel is
  conspicuous. Bruce gives a long and detailed account of Amda Zion’s
  resolute and successful campaigns against this confederacy. It
  bears a strong general resemblance to Marco’s narrative, always
  excepting the story of the Bishop, of which Bruce has no trace, and
  always admitting that our traveller has confounded Aden with Adel.

  But the chronology is obviously in the way of identification of
  the histories. Marco could not have related in 1298 events that
  did not occur till 1315–16. Mr. Salt however, in his version of
  the chronology, not only puts the accession of Amda Zion eleven
  years earlier than Bruce, but even then has so little confidence in
  its accuracy, and is so much disposed to identify the histories,
  that he suggests that the Abyssinian dates should be carried back
  further still by some 20 years, on the authority of the narrative
  in our text. M. Pauthier takes a like view.

  I was for some time much disposed to do likewise, but after
  examining the subject more minutely, I am obliged to reject this
  view, and to abide by Bruce’s Chronology. To elucidate this I must
  exhibit the whole list of the Abyssinian Kings from the restoration
  of the line of Solomon to the middle of the 16th century, at which
  period Bruce finds a check to the chronology in the record of a
  solar eclipse. The chronologies have been extracted independently
  by Bruce, Rüppell, and Salt; the latter using a different version
  of the Annals from the other two. I set down all three.

  ------------+--------+---------+--------+-----------+--------+---------

  Bruce checks his chronology by an eclipse which took place in
  1553, and which the Abyssinian chronicle assigns to the 13th year
  of Claudius. This alone would be scarcely satisfactory as a basis
  for the retrospective control of reigns extending through nearly
  three centuries; but we find some other checks.

  Thus in Quatremère’s Makrizi we find a correspondence between
  Sultan Bibars and the King of Habasha, or of Amhara, _Maḥar_ AMLÁK,
  which occurred in A.H. 672 or 673, _i.e._ A.D. 1273–1274. This
  would fall within the reign of Icon AMLAK according to Bruce’s
  chronology, but not according to Salt’s, and _à fortiori_ not
  according to any chronology throwing the reigns further back still.

  In Quatremère’s _Égypte_ we find another notice of a letter which
  came to the Sultan of Egypt from the King of Abyssinia, IAKBA SIUN,
  in Ramadhan 689, _i.e._ in the end of A.D. 1289.

  Again, this is perfectly consistent with Bruce’s order and dates,
  but not with Salt’s.

  The same work contains a notice of an inroad on the Mussulman
  territory of Assuan by David (II.), the son of Saif Arad, in the
  year 783 (A.D. 1381–1382).

  In Rink’s translation of a work of Makrizi’s it is stated that
  this same King David died in A.H. 812, _i.e._ A.D. 1409; that he
  was succeeded by Theodorus, whose reign was very brief, and he
  again by Isaac, who died in Dhulkada 833, _i.e._ July–August 1430.
  These dates are in close or substantial agreement with Bruce’s
  chronology, but not at all with Salt’s or any chronology throwing
  the reigns further back. Makrizi goes on to say that Isaac was
  succeeded by Andreas, who reigned only four months, and then by
  Hazbana, who died in Ramadhan 834, _i.e._ May–June 1431. This last
  date does not agree, but we are now justified in suspecting an
  error in the Hijra date,[6] whilst the 4 _months’_ reign ascribed
  to Andreas shows that Salt again is wrong in extending it to 7
  _years_, and Bruce presumably right in making it 7 _months_.

  These coincidences seem to me sufficient to maintain the
  substantial accuracy of Bruce’s chronology, and to be fatal to the
  identification of Marco’s story with that of the wars of Amda Zion.
  The general identity in the duration of reigns as given by Rüppell
  shows that Bruce did not tamper with these. It is remarkable that
  in Makrizi’s report of the letter of Igba Zion in 1289 (the very
  year when according to the text this anti-Mahomedan war was going
  on), that Prince tells the Sultan that he is a protector of the
  Mahomedans in Abyssinia, acting in that respect _quite differently
  from his Father who had been so hostile to them_.

  I suspect therefore that _Icon Amlak_ must have been the true hero
  of Marco’s story, and that the date must be thrown back, probably
  to 1278.

  Rüppell is at a loss to understand where Bruce got the long story
  of Amda Zion’s heroic deeds, which enters into extraordinary
  detail, embracing speeches after the manner of the Roman historians
  and the like, and occupies some 60 pages in the French edition of
  Bruce which I have been using. The German traveller could find
  no trace of this story in any of the versions of the Abyssinian
  chronicle which he consulted, nor was it known to a learned
  Abyssinian whom he names. Bruce himself says that the story,
  which he has “a little abridged and accommodated to our manner of
  writing, was derived from a work written in very pure Gheez, in
  Shoa, under the reign of Zara Jacob”; and though it is possible
  that his amplifications outweigh his abridgments, we cannot doubt
  that he had an original groundwork for his narrative.

  The work of Makrizi already quoted speaks of seven kingdoms in
  Zaila’ (here used for the Mahomedan low country) originally
  tributary to the Hati (or Negush) of Amhara, viz., _Aufat_,[7]
  _Dawaro_, Arababni, _Hadiah_, Shirha, Bali, Darah. Of these Ifat,
  Dawaro, and Hadiah repeatedly occur in Bruce’s story of the war.
  Bruce also tells us that Amda Zion, when he removed _Hakeddin_,
  the Governor of Ifat, who had murdered his agent, replaced him by
  his brother _Sabreddin_. Now we find in Makrizi that _about_ A.H.
  700, the reigning governor of Aufat under the Hati was _Sabreddin_
  Mahomed Valahui; and that it was ’Ali, the son of this Sabreddin,
  who first threw off allegiance to the Abyssinian King, then Saif
  Arad (son of Amda Zion). The latter displaces ’Ali and gives the
  government to his son Ahmed. After various vicissitudes Hakeddin,
  the son of Ahmed, obtains the mastery in Aufat, defeats Saif
  Arad completely, and founds a city in Shoa called Vahal, which
  superseded Aufat or Ifat. Here the _Sabreddin_ of Makrizi appears
  to be identical with Amda Zion’s governor in Bruce’s story, whilst
  the _Hakeddins_ belong to two different generations of the same
  family. But Makrizi does not notice the wars of Amda Zion any more
  than the Abyssinian Chronicles notice the campaign recorded by
  Marco Polo.

  [We read in the _Si Shi ki_: “There is (in Western Asia) a
  large bird, above 10 feet high, with feet like a camel, and of
  bluish-grey colour. When it runs it flaps the wings. It eats fire,
  and its eggs are of the size of a _sheng_ (a certain measure
  for grain).” (_Bretschneider, Med. Res._, I. pp. 143–144.) Dr.
  Bretschneider gives a long note on the ostrich, called in Persian
  _shutur-murg_ (camel-bird), from which we gather the following
  information: “The ostrich, although found only in the desert of
  Africa and Western Asia, was known to the Chinese in early times,
  since their first intercourse with the countries of the far west.
  In the History of the Han (_T’sien Han shu_, ch. xcvi.) it is
  stated that the Emperor _Wu-ti_, B.C. 140–86, first sent an
  embassy to _An-si_, a country of Western Asia, which, according to
  the description given of it, can only be identified with ancient
  _Parthia_, the empire of the dynasty of the Arsacides. In this
  country, the Chinese chronicler records, a large bird from 8 to 9
  feet high is found, the feet, the breast, and the neck of which
  make it resemble the camel. It eats barley. The name of this bird
  is _ta ma tsio_ (the bird of the great horse). It is further
  stated that subsequently the ruler of An-si sent an embassy to the
  Chinese emperor, and brought as a present the eggs of this great
  bird. In the _Hou Han shu_, ch. cxviii., an embassy from An-si is
  mentioned again in A.D. 101. They brought as presents a lion and
  a large bird. In the History of the _Weí_ Dynasty, A.D. 386–558,
  where for the first time the name of _Po-sz’_ occurs, used to
  designate Persia, it is recorded that in that country there is a
  large bird resembling a camel and laying eggs of large size. It has
  wings and cannot fly far. It eats grass and flesh, and swallows
  men. In the History of the _T’ang_ (618–907) the camel-bird is
  again mentioned as a bird of Persia. It is also stated there
  that the ruler of _T’u-huo-lo_ (Tokharestan) sent a camel-bird
  to the Chinese emperor. The Chinese materia medica, _Pen ts’ao
  Kang mu_, written in the 16th century, gives (ch. xlix.) a good
  description of the ostrich, compiled from ancient authors. It is
  said, amongst other things, to eat copper, iron, stones, etc., and
  to have only two claws on its feet. Its legs are so strong that
  it can dangerously wound a man by jerking. It can run 300 _li_
  a day. Its native countries are _A-dan_ (Aden) _Dju-bo_ (on the
  Eastern African coast). A rude but tolerably exact drawing of the
  camel-bird in the Pen-ts’ao proves that the ostrich was well known
  to the Chinese in ancient times, and that they paid great attention
  to it. In the History of the _Ming_ Dynasty, ch. cccxxvi., the
  country of _Hu-lu-mo-sz’_ (Hormuz on the Persian Gulf) is mentioned
  as producing ostriches.”—H. C.]

                            CHAPTER XXXVI.

                   CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF ADEN.


You must know that in the province of ADEN there is a Prince who is
called the Soldan. The people are all Saracens and adorers of Mahommet,
and have a great hatred of Christians. There are many towns and
villages in the country.

This Aden is the port to which many of the ships of India come with
their cargoes; and from this haven the merchants carry the goods a
distance of seven days further in small vessels. At the end of those
seven days they land the goods and load them on camels, and so carry
them a land journey of 30 days. This brings them to the river of
ALEXANDRIA, and by it they descend to the latter city. It is by this
way through Aden that the Saracens of Alexandria receive all their
stores of pepper and other spicery; and there is no other route equally
good and convenient by which these goods could reach that place.{1}

And you must know that the Soldan of Aden receives a large amount in
duties from the ships that traffic between India and his country,
importing different kinds of goods; and from the exports also he gets a
revenue, for there are despatched from the port of Aden to India a very
large number of Arab chargers, and palfreys, and stout nags adapted for
all work, which are a source of great profit to those who export them.
{2} For horses fetch very high prices in India, there being none bred
there, as I have told you before; insomuch that a charger will sell
there for 100 marks of silver and more. On these also the Soldan of
Aden receives heavy payments in port charges, so that ’tis said he is
one of the richest princes in the world.{3}

And it is a fact that when the Soldan of Babylon went against the city
of Acre and took it, this Soldan of Aden sent to his assistance 30,000
horsemen and full 40,000 camels, to the great help of the Saracens and
the grievous injury of the Christians. He did this a great deal more
for the hate he bears the Christians than for any love he bears the
Soldan of Babylon; for these two do hate one another heartily.{4}

Now we will have done with the Soldan of Aden, and I will tell you of a
city which is subject to Aden, called Esher.


  NOTE 1.—This is from Pauthier’s text, which is here superior to
  the G. T. The latter has: “They put the goods in small vessels,
  which proceed _on a river_ about seven days.” _Ram._ has, “in other
  smaller vessels, with which they make a voyage on a gulf of the
  sea for 20 days, more or less, as the weather may be. On reaching
  a certain port they load the goods on camels, and carry them a 30
  days’ journey by land to the River Nile, where they embark them
  in small vessels called _Zerms_, and in these descend the current
  to Cairo, and thence by an artificial cut, called _Calizene_,
  to Alexandria.” The last looks as if it had been _edited_; Polo
  never uses the name _Cairo_. The canal, the predecessor of the
  _Mahmúdíah_, is also called _Il Caligine_ in the journey of Simon
  Sigoli (_Frescobaldi_, p. 168). Brunetto Latini, too, discoursing of
  the Nile, says:—

      “Così serva su’ filo,
       Ed è chiamato Nilo.
       D’un su’ ramo si dice,
       Ch’è chiamato _Calice_.”
                      —_Tesoretto_, pp. 81–82.

  Also in the _Sfera_ of Dati:—

        ——“Chiamasi il _Caligine_
      Egion e Nilo, e non si sa l’origine.” P. 9.

  The word is (Ar.) _Khalíj_, applied in one of its senses specially
  to the canals drawn from the full Nile. The port on the Red Sea
  would be either Suákin or Aidháb; the 30 days’ journey seems to
  point to the former. Polo’s contemporary, Marino Sanudo, gives the
  following account of the transit, omitting _entirely_ the Red Sea
  navigation, though his line correctly represented would apparently
  go by Kosseir: “The fourth haven is called AHADEN, and stands on a
  certain little island joining, as it were, to the main, in the land
  of the Saracens. The spices and other goods from India are landed
  there, loaded on camels, and so carried by a journey of nine days
  to a place on the River Nile, called _Chus_ (_Kús_, the ancient
  _Cos_ below Luqsor), where they are put into boats and conveyed in
  15 days to Babylon. But in the month of October and thereabouts the
  river rises to such an extent that the spices, etc., continue to
  descend the stream from Babylon and enter a certain long canal, and
  so are conveyed over the 200 miles between Babylon and Alexandria.”
  (Bk. I. pt. i. ch. i.)

  Makrizi relates that up to A.H. 725 (1325), from time immemorial
  the Indian ships had discharged at Aden, but in that year the
  exactions of the Sultan induced a shipmaster to pass on into the
  Red Sea, and eventually the trade came to Jidda. (See _De Sacy,
  Chrest. Arabe_, II. 556.)

  ✛Aden is mentioned (_A-dan_) in ch. cccxxxvi. of the Ming History
  as having sent an embassy to China in 1427. These embassies were
  subsequently often repeated. The country, which lay 22 days’ voyage
  west of _Kuli_ (supposed Calicut, but perhaps Káyal), was devoid of
  grass or trees. (_Bretschneider, Med. Res._, II. pp. 305–306.)

  [Ma-huan (transl. by Phillips) writes (_J. R. A. S._, April 1896):
  “In the nineteenth year of Yung-lo (1422) an Imperial Envoy, the
  eunuch Li, was sent from China to this country with a letter
  and presents to the King. On his arrival he was most honourably
  received, and was met by the king on landing and conducted by him
  to his palace.”—H. C.]

  NOTE 2.—The words describing the horses are (P.’s text): “_de bons
  destriers Arrabins et chevaux et grans roncins_ à ij selles.” The
  meaning seems to be what I have expressed in the text, fit either
  for saddle or pack-saddle.

  [_Roncins à deux selles_. Littré’s great Dictionary supplies an apt
  illustration of this phrase. A contemporary _Eloge de Charles VII._
  says: “_Jamais il chevauchoit mule ne haquenée, mais_ un bas cheval
  trotier entre deux selles” (a cob?).]

  In one application the _Deux selles_ of the old riding-schools were
  the two styles of riding, called in Spanish _Montar á la Gineta_
  and _Montar á la Brida_. The latter stands for the old French
  style, with heavy bit and saddle, and long stirrups just reached
  by the toes; the former the Moorish style, with short stirrups and
  lighter bit. But the phrase would also seem to have meant _saddle
  and pack-saddle_. Thus Cobarruvias explains the phrase _Hombre de
  dos sillas_, “Conviene saber de la gineta y brida, _ser de silla y
  albarda_ (pack-saddle), _servir de todo_,” and we find the converse
  expression, _No ser para silla ni para albarda_, good for nothing.

  But for an example of the exact phrase of the French text I am
  indebted to P. della Valle. Speaking of the Persian horses, he
  says: “Few of them are of any great height, and you seldom see
  thoroughbreds among them; probably because here they have no liking
  for such and don’t seek to breed them. For the most part they are
  of that very useful style that we call horses for both saddles
  (_che noi chiamiamo da due selle_),” etc. (See _Cobarruvias_, under
  _Silla_ and _Brida; Dicc. de la Lengua Castellana por la Real
  Academia Española_, under _Silla, Gineta, Brida; P. della Valle_,

  NOTE 3.—The supposed confusion between Adel and Aden does not
  affect this chapter.

  The “Soldan of Aden” was the Sultan of Yemen, whose chief residence
  was at Ta’izz, North-East of Mokha. The prince reigning in Polo’s
  day was Malik Muzaffar Shamsuddín Abu’l Mahasen Yusuf. His father,
  Malik Mansúr, a retainer of the Ayubite Dynasty, had been sent by
  Saladin as Wazir to Yemen, with his brother Malik Muazzam Turan
  Shah. After the death of the latter, and of his successor, the
  Wazir assumed the government and became the founder of a dynasty.
  Aden was the chief port of his dominions. It had been a seat of
  direct trade with China in the early centuries of Islam.

  Ibn Batuta speaks of it thus correctly: “It is enclosed by
  mountains, and you can enter by one side only. It is a large town,
  but has neither corn nor trees, nor fresh water, except from
  reservoirs made to catch the rain-water; for other drinking water
  is at a great distance from the town. The Arabs often prevent the
  townspeople coming to fetch it until the latter have come to terms
  with them, and paid them a bribe in money or cloths. The heat at
  Aden is great. It is the port frequented by the people from India,
  and great ships come thither from Kunbáyat, Tána, Kaulam, Ḳaliḳúṭ,
  Fandaráina, Sháliát, Manjarúr, Fákanúr, Hinaur, Sindábúr,[1] etc.
  There are Indian merchants residing in the city, and Egyptian
  merchants as well.”

  The tanks of which the Moor speaks had been buried by débris; of
  late years they have been cleared and repaired. They are grand
  works. They are said to have been formerly 50 in number, with a
  capacity of 30 million gallons.

  This cut, from a sketch by Dr. Kirk, gives an excellent idea of
  Aden as seen by a ship approaching from India. The large plate
  again, reduced from a grand and probably unique contemporary
  wood-engraving of great size, shows the impression that the city
  made upon European eyes in the beginning of the 16th century. It
  will seem absurd, especially to those who knew Aden in the early
  days of our occupation, and no doubt some of the details are
  extravagant, but the general impression is quite consonant with
  that derived from the description of De Barros and Andrea Corsali:
  “In site and aspect from the seaward,” says the former, “the city
  forms a beautiful object, for besides the part which lies along the
  shore with its fine walls and towers, its many public buildings and
  rows of houses rising aloft in many stories, with terraced roofs,
  you have all that ridge of mountain facing the sea and presenting
  to its very summit a striking picture of the operations of Nature,
  and still more of the industry of man.” This historian says that
  the prosperity of Aden increased on the arrival of the Portuguese
  in those seas, for the Mussulman traders from Jidda and the Red
  Sea ports now dreaded these western corsairs, and made Aden an
  entrepôt, instead of passing it by as they used to do in days
  of unobstructed navigation. This prosperity, however, must have
  been of very brief duration. Corsali’s account of Aden (in 1517)
  is excellent, but too long for extract. (_Makrizi_, IV. 26–27;

  NOTE 4.—I have not been able to trace any other special notice of
  the part taken by the Sultan of Yemen in the capture of Acre by the
  Mameluke Sultan, Malik Ashraf Khalil, in 1291. Ibn Ferat, quoted
  by Reinaud, says that the Sultan sent into all the provinces the
  most urgent orders for the supply of troops and machines; and there
  gathered from all sides the warriors of Damascus, of Hamath, and
  the rest of Syria, of Egypt, and of _Arabia_. (_Michaud, Bibl. des
  Croisades_, 1829, IV. 569.)

  “I once” (says Joinville) “rehearsed to the Legate two cases of sin
  that a priest of mine had been telling me of, and he answered me
  thus: ‘No man knows as much of the heinous sins that are done in
  Acre as I do; and it cannot be but God will take vengeance on them,
  in such a way that the city of Acre shall be washed in the blood
  of its inhabitants, and that another people shall come to occupy
  after them.’ The good man’s prophecy hath come true in part, for of
  a truth the city hath been washed in the blood of its inhabitants,
  but those to replace them are not yet come: may God send them good
  when it pleases Him!” (p. 192).

                            CHAPTER XXXVII.

                     CONCERNING THE CITY OF ESHER.


Esher is a great city lying in a north-westerly direction from the
last, and 400 miles distant from the Port of Aden. It has a king, who
is subject to the Soldan of Aden. He has a number of towns and villages
under him, and administers his territory well and justly.

The people are Saracens. The place has a very good haven, wherefore
many ships from India come thither with various cargoes; and they
export many good chargers thence to India.{1}

A great deal of white incense grows in this country, and brings in a
great revenue to the Prince; for no one dares sell it to any one else;
and whilst he takes it from the people at 10 livres of gold for the
hundredweight, he sells it to the merchants at 60 livres, so his profit
is immense.{2}

Dates also grow very abundantly here. The people have no corn but rice,
and very little of that; but plenty is brought from abroad, for it
sells here at a good profit. They have fish in great profusion, and
notably plenty of tunny of large size; so plentiful indeed that you may
buy two big ones for a Venice groat of silver. The natives live on meat
and rice and fish. They have no wine of the vine, but they make good
wine from sugar, from rice, and from dates also.

And I must tell you another very strange thing. You must know that
their sheep have no ears, but where the ear ought to be they have a
little horn! They are pretty little beasts.{3}

And I must not omit to tell you that all their cattle, including
horses, oxen, and camels, live upon small fish and nought besides,
for ’tis all they get to eat. You see in all this country there is no
grass or forage of any kind; it is the driest country on the face of
the earth. The fish which are given to the cattle are very small, and
during March, April, and May, are caught in such quantities as would
astonish you. They are then dried and stored, and the beasts are fed on
them from year’s end to year’s end. The cattle will also readily eat
these fish all alive and just out of the water.{4}

The people here have likewise many other kinds of fish of large size
and good quality, exceedingly cheap; these they cut in pieces of about
a pound each, and dry them in the sun, and then store them, and eat
them all the year through, like so much biscuit.{5}


  NOTE 1.—_Shiḥr_ or _Sheḥr_, with the article, ES-SHEḤR, still
  exists on the Arabian coast, as a town and district about 330 m.
  east of Aden. In 1839 Captain Haines described the modern town
  as extending in a scattered manner for a mile along the shore,
  the population about 6000, and the trade considerable, producing
  duties to the amount of 5000_l._ a year. It was then the residence
  of the Sultan of the Hamúm tribe of Arabs. There is only an open
  roadstead for anchorage. Perhaps, however, the old city is to be
  looked for about ten miles to the westward, where there is another
  place bearing the same name, “once a thriving town, but now a
  desolate group of houses with an old fort, formerly the residence
  of the chief of the _Kaṣaidi_ tribe.” (_J. R. G. S._ IX. 151–152.)
  Sheḥr is spoken of by Barbosa (_Xaer_ in Lisbon ed.; _Pecher_ in
  Ramusio; _Xeher_ in Stanley; in the two last misplaced to the
  east of Dhofar): “It is a very large place, and there is a great
  traffic in goods imported by the Moors of Cambaia, Chaul, Dabul,
  Batticala, and the cities of Malabar, such as cotton-stuffs ...
  strings of garnets, and many other stones of inferior value; also
  much rice and sugar, and spices of all sorts, with coco-nuts; ...
  their money they invest in horses for India, which are here very
  large and good. Every one of them is worth in India 500 or 600
  ducats.” (_Ram._ f. 292.) The name Sheḥr in some of the Oriental
  geographies, includes the whole coast up to Omán.

  NOTE 2.—The hills of the Sheḥr and Dhafár districts were the great
  source of produce of the Arabian frankincense. Barbosa says of
  Sheḥr: “They carry away much incense, which is produced at this
  place and in the interior; ... it is exported hence all over the
  world, and here it is used to pay ships with, for on the spot it
  is worth only 150 farthings the hundredweight.” See note 2, ch.
  xxvii. _supra_; and next chapter, note 2.

  NOTE 3.—This was no doubt a breed of four-horned sheep, and Polo,
  or his informant, took the lower pair of horns for abnormal ears.
  Probably the breed exists, but we have little information on
  details in reference to this coast. The Rev. G. P. Badger, D.C.L.,
  writes: “There are sheep on the eastern coast of Arabia, and as
  high up as Mohammerah on the Shatt-al-Arab, _with very small ears
  indeed_; so small as to be almost imperceptible at first sight near
  the projecting horns. I saw one at Mohammerah having _six_ horns.”
  And another friend, Mr. Arthur Grote, tells me he had for some time
  at Calcutta a 4-horned sheep from Aden.

  NOTE 4.—This custom holds more or less on all the Arabian coast
  from Sheḥr to the Persian Gulf, and on the coast east of the Gulf
  also. Edrisi mentions it at Sheḥr (printed _Shajr_, I. 152), and
  the Admiral Sidi ’Ali says: “On the coast of Shehr, men and animals
  all live on fish” (_J. A. S. B._ V. 461). Ibn Batuta tells the
  same of Dhafár, the subject of next chapter: “The fish consist
  for the most part of sardines, which are here of the fattest. The
  surprising thing is that all kinds of cattle are fed on these
  sardines, and sheep likewise. I have never seen anything like that
  elsewhere” (II. 197). Compare Strabo’s account of the Ichthyophagi
  on the coast of Mekran (XV. 11), and the like account in the life
  of Apollonius of Tyana (III. 56).

  [Burton, quoted by Yule, says (_Sind Revisited_, 1877, I. p. 33):
  “The whole of the coast, including that of Mekrán, the land of
  the _Máhi Khárán_ or Ichthyophagi.” Yule adds: “I have seen this
  suggested also elsewhere. It seems a highly probable etymology.”
  See note, p. 402.—H. C.]

  NOTE 5.—At Hásik, east of Dhafár, Ibn Batuta says: “The people here
  live on a kind of fish called _Al-Lukham_, resembling that called
  the sea-dog. They cut it in slices and strips, dry it in the sun,
  salt it, and feed on it. Their houses are made with fish-bones, and
  their roofs with camel-hides” (II. 214).




                           CHAPTER XXXVIII.

                     CONCERNING THE CITY OF DUFAR.


Dufar is a great and noble and fine city, and lies 500 miles to the
north-west of Esher. The people are Saracens, and have a Count for
their chief, who is subject to the Soldan of Aden; for this city still
belongs to the Province of Aden. It stands upon the sea and has a very
good haven, so that there is a great traffic of shipping between this
and India; and the merchants take hence great numbers of Arab horses to
that market, making great profits thereby. This city has under it many
other towns and villages.{1}

Much white incense is produced here, and I will tell you how it grows.
The trees are like small fir-trees; these are notched with a knife in
several places, and from these notches the incense is exuded. Sometimes
also it flows from the tree without any notch; this is by reason of the
great heat of the sun there.{2}


  NOTE 1.—_Dufar_. The name ظفار is variously pronounced Dhafár,
  DHOFAR, Zhafár, and survives attached to a well-watered and fertile
  plain district opening on the sea, nearly 400 miles east of Sheḥr,
  though according to Haines there is now no _town_ of the name.
  Ibn Batuta speaks of the city as situated at the extremity of
  Yemen (“the province of Aden”), and mentions its horse-trade, its
  unequalled dirt, stench, and flies, and consequent diseases. (See
  II. 196 _seqq._) What he says of the desert character of the tract
  round the town is not in accordance with modern descriptions of
  the plain of Dhafár, nor seemingly with his own statements of the
  splendid bananas grown there, as well as other Indian products,
  betel, and coco-nut. His account of the Sultan of Zhafár in his
  time corroborates Polo’s, for he says that prince was the son of a
  cousin of the King of Yemen, who had _been chief of Zhafár under
  the suzeraineté of that King and tributary to him_. The only ruins
  mentioned by Haines are extensive ones near Haffer, towards the
  _western_ part of the plain; and this Fresnel considers to be the
  site of the former city. A lake which exists here, on the landward
  side of the ruins, was, he says, formerly a gulf, and formed the
  port, “the very good haven,” of which our author speaks.

  A quotation in the next note however indicates Merbát, which is
  at the eastern extremity of the plain, as having been the port of
  Dhafár in the Middle Ages. Professor Sprenger is of opinion that
  the city itself was in the eastern part of the plain. The matter
  evidently needs further examination.

  This Dhafár, or the bold mountain above it, is supposed to be
  the _Sephar_ of Genesis (x. 30). But it does not seem to be the
  _Sapphara metropolis_ of Ptolemy, which is rather an inland city of
  the same name: “Dhafár was the name of _two_ cities of Yemen, one
  of which was near Sana’á ... it was the residence of the Himyarite
  Princes; some authors allege that it is identical with Sana’á”
  (_Maráṣid-al-Ittila’_, in Reinaud’s Abulfeda, I. p. 124).

  _Dofar_ is noted by Camoens for its fragrant incense. It was
  believed in Malabar that the famous King Cheram Perumal, converted
  to Islám, died on the pilgrimage to Mecca and was buried at Dhafár,
  where his tomb was much visited for its sanctity.

  The place is mentioned (_Tsafarh_) in the Ming Annals of China
  as a Mahomedan country lying, with a fair wind, 10 days N.W. of
  _Kuli_ (_supra_, p. 440). Ostriches were found there, and among
  the products are named drugs which Dr. Bretschneider renders as
  _Olibanum_, _Storax liquida_, _Myrrh_, _Catechu_ (?), _Dragon’s
  blood_. This state sent an embassy (so-called) to China in
  1422. (_Haines_ in _J. R. G. S._ XV. 116 _seqq._; _Playfair’s
  Yemen_, p. 31; _Fresnel_ in _J. As._ sér. 3, tom. V. 517 _seqq._;
  _Tohfut-ul-Mujahideen_, p. 56; _Bretschneider_, p. 19.)

  NOTE 2.—Frankincense presents a remarkable example of the obscurity
  which so often attends the history of familiar drugs; though in
  this case the darkness has been, like that of which Marco spoke in
  his account of the Caraonas (vol. i. p. 98), much of man’s making.

  This coast of Hadhramaut is the true and ancient χώρα λιβανοφόρος
  or λιβανωτοφόρος, indicated or described under those names by
  Theophrastus, Ptolemy, Pliny, Pseudo-Arrian, and other classical
  writers; _i.e._ the country producing the fragrant gum-resin called
  by the Hebrews _Lebonah_, by the Brahmans apparently _Kundu_
  and _Kunduru_, by the Arabs _Lubán_ and _Kundur_, by the Greeks
  _Libanos_, by the Romans _Thus_, in mediæval Latin _Olibanum_, and
  in English _Frankincense_, _i.e._ I apprehend, “Genuine incense,”
  or “Incense Proper.”[1] It is still produced in this region and
  exported from it: but the larger part of that which enters the
  markets of the world is exported from the roadsteads of the
  opposite Sumálí coast. In ancient times also an important quantity
  was exported from the latter coast, immediately west of Cape
  Gardafui (_Aromatum Prom._), and in the Periplus this frankincense
  is distinguished by the title _Peratic_, “from over the water.”

  The _Maráṣid-al-Ittila’_, a Geog. Dictionary of the end of the 14th
  century, in a passage of which we have quoted the commencement
  in the preceding note, proceeds as follows: “The other Dhafár,
  which still subsists, is on the shore of the Indian Sea, distant 5
  parasangs from Mérbáth in the province of Shehr. Mérbáth lies below
  Dhafár, and serves as its port. Olibanum is found nowhere except
  in the mountains of Dhafár, in the territory of Shehr; in a tract
  which extends 3 days in length and the same in breadth. The natives
  make incisions in the trees with a knife, and the incense flows
  down. This incense is carefully watched, and can be taken only
  to Dhafár, where the Sultan keeps the best part for himself; the
  rest is made over to the people. But any one who should carry it
  elsewhere than to Dhafár would be put to death.”

  The elder Niebuhr seems to have been the first to disparage the
  Arabian produce of olibanum. He recognises indeed its ancient
  celebrity, and the fact that it was still to some extent exported
  from Dhafár and other places on this coast, but he says that the
  Arabs preferred foreign kinds of incense, especially benzoin; and
  also repeatedly speaks of the superiority of that from India (_des
  Indes_ and _de l’Inde_), by which it is probable that he meant the
  same thing—viz., benzoin from the Indian Archipelago. Niebuhr did
  not himself visit Hadhramaut.

  Thus the fame of Arabian olibanum was dying away, and so was our
  knowledge of that and the opposite African coast, when Colebrooke
  (1807) published his Essay on Olibanum, in which he showed that a
  gum-resin, identical as he considered with frankincense, and so
  named (_Kundur_), was used in India, and was the produce of an
  indigenous tree, _Boswellia serrata_ of Roxburgh, but thereafter
  known as _B. thurifera_. This discovery, connecting itself, it
  may be supposed, with Niebuhr’s statements about Indian olibanum
  (though probably misunderstood), and with the older tradition
  coming down from Dioscorides of a so-called Indian _libanos_
  (_supra_ p. 396), seems to have induced a hasty and general
  assumption that the Indian resin was the olibanum of commerce;
  insomuch that the very existence of Arabian olibanum came to be
  treated as a matter of doubt in some respectable books, and that
  down to a very recent date.

  In the Atlas to Bruce’s Travels is figured a plant under the
  name of _Angoua_, which the Abyssinians believed to produce true
  olibanum, and which Bruce says did really produce a gum resembling
  it.

  In 1837 Lieut. Cruttenden of the Indian Navy saw the frankincense
  tree of Arabia on a journey inland from Merbát, and during the
  ensuing year the trees of the Sumálí country were seen, and
  partially described by Kempthorne, and Vaughan of the same service,
  and by Cruttenden himself. Captain Haines also in his report of the
  Survey of the Hadhramaut coast in 1843–1844,[2] speaks, apparently
  as an eye-witness, of the frankincense trees about Dhafár as
  extremely numerous, and adds that from 3000 to 10,000 _maunds_
  were annually exported “from Merbát and Dhafár.” “3 to 10” is vague
  enough; but as the kind of _maund_ is not specified it is vaguer
  still. Maunds differ as much as _livres Français_ and _livres
  sterling_. In 1844 and 1846 Dr. Carter also had opportunities of
  examining olibanum trees on this coast, which he turned to good
  account, sending to Government cuttings, specimens, and drawings,
  and publishing a paper on the subject in the Journal of the Bombay
  Branch of the R. As. Society (1847).

  [Illustration: The Harvest of Frankincense in Arabia. Facsimile
    of an engraving in Thevet’s _Cosmographie Universelle_ (1575),
    reproduced from the _Bible Educator_.[3]]

  But neither Dr. Carter’s paper and specimens, nor the previous
  looser notices of the naval officers, seemed to attract any
  attention, and men of no small repute went on repeating in their
  manuals the old story about Indian olibanum. Dr. G. Birdwood
  however, at Bombay, in the years following 1859, took up the
  subject with great zeal and intelligence, procuring numerous
  specimens of the Sumálí trees and products; and his monograph of
  the genus _Boswellia_ in the Linnaean Transactions (read April
  1869), to which this note is very greatly indebted, is a most
  interesting paper, and may be looked on, I believe, as embodying
  the most correct knowledge as yet attainable. The species as ranked
  in his table are the following:

  [Illustration: _J.D. COOPER. SC_

    Boswellia Frereana (_Birdw._).]

  1. _Boswellia Carterii_ (Birdw.), including the Arabian tree of
  Dhafár, and the larger variety called _Mohr Madau_ by the Sumálís.

  2. _B. Bhau-dajiana_ (Birdw.), _Mohr A’d_ of the Sumálís.

  3. _B. papyrifera_ (Richard). Abyssinian species.

  4. _B. thurifera_ (Colebr.), see p. 396 _supra_.

  5. _B. Frereana_ (Birdw.), _Yegár_ of the Sumálís—named after Mr.
  William Frere, Member of Council at Bombay. No. 2 was named from
  Bhau Dáji, a very eminent Hindu scholar and physician at Bombay
  (Birdw.).

  No. 1 produces the Arabian olibanum, and Nos. 1 and 2 together the
  bulk of the olibanum exported from the Sumálí coast under the name
  _Lubán-Shehri_. Both are said to give an inferior kind besides,
  called _L. Bedawi_. No. 3 is, according to Birdwood, the same as
  Bruce’s _Angoua_. No. 5 is distinctly a new species, and affords a
  highly fragrant resin sold under the name of _Lubán Méti_.

  Bombay is now the great mart of frankincense. The quantity exported
  thence in 1872–1873 was 25,000 _cwt._, of which nearly one quarter
  went to China.

  Frankincense when it first exudes is milky white; whence the name
  “White Incense” by which Polo speaks of it. And the Arabic name
  _lúbán_ apparently refers to milk. The Chinese have so translated,
  calling it _Ju-siang_ or Milk-perfume.

  Polo, we see, says the tree was like a fir tree; and it is
  remarkable that a Chinese Pharmacology quoted by Bretschneider
  says the like, which looks as if their information came from a
  common source. And yet I think Polo’s must have been oral. One of
  the meanings of _Lubán_, from the Kámús, is _Pinus_ (_Freytag_).
  This may have to do with the error. Dr. Birdwood, in a paper in
  _Cassell’s Bible Educator_, has given a copy of a remarkable
  wood engraving from Thevet’s _Cosmographie Universelle_ (1575),
  representing the collection of Arabian olibanum, and this through
  his kind intervention I am able to reproduce here. The text
  (probably after Polo) speaks of the tree as resembling a fir, but
  in the cut the firs are in the background; the incense trees have
  some real suggestion of _Boswellia_, and the whole design has
  singular spirit and verisimilitude.

  Dr. Birdwood thus speaks of the _B. Frereana_, the only species
  that he has seen in flower: “As I saw the plant in Playfair’s
  garden at Aden ... in young leaf and covered with bloom, I was
  much struck by its elegant singularity. The long racemes of green
  star-like flowers, tipped with the red anthers of the stamens (like
  aigrettes of little stars of emerald set with minute rubies),
  droop gracefully over the clusters of glossy, glaucous leaves; and
  every part of the plant (bark, leaves, and flowers) gives out the
  most refreshing lemon-like fragrance.” (_Birdwood_ in Linnaean
  Transactions for 1869, pp. 109 _seqq._; _Hanbury_ and _Flückiger’s
  Pharmacographia_, pp. 120 _seqq._; _Ritter_, xii. 356 _seqq._;

    The mediæval _Olibanum_ was probably the Arabic _Al-lubán_, but was

                            CHAPTER XXXIX.

         CONCERNING THE GULF OF CALATU AND THE CITY SO CALLED.


Calatu is a great city, within a gulf which bears the name of the Gulf
of Calatu. It is a noble city, and lies 600 miles from Dufar towards
the north-west, upon the sea-shore. The people are Saracens, and are
subject to Hormos. And whenever the Melic of Hormos is at war with
some prince more potent than himself, he betakes himself to this city
of Calatu, because it is very strong, both from its position and its
fortifications.{1}

They grow no corn here, but get it from abroad; for every
merchant-vessel that comes brings some. The haven is very large and
good, and is frequented by numerous ships with goods from India, and
from this city the spices and other merchandize are distributed among
the cities and towns of the interior. They also export many good Arab
horses from this to India.{2} For, as I have told you before, the
number of horses exported from this and the other cities to India
yearly is something astonishing. One reason is that no horses are bred
there, and another that they die as soon as they get there, through
ignorant handling; for the people there do not know how to take care of
them, and they feed their horses with cooked victuals and all sorts of
trash, as I have told you fully heretofore; and besides all that they
have no farriers.

This City of Calatu stands at the mouth of the Gulf, so that no ship
can enter or go forth without the will of the chief. And when the Melic
of Hormos, who is Melic of Calatu also, and is vassal to the Soldan
of Kerman, fears anything at the hand of the latter, he gets on board
his ships and comes from Hormos to Calatu. And then he prevents any
ship from entering the Gulf. This causes great injury to the Soldan of
Kerman; for he thus loses all the duties that he is wont to receive
from merchants frequenting his territories from India or elsewhere; for
ships with cargoes of merchandize come in great numbers, and a very
large revenue is derived from them. In this way he is constrained to
give way to the demands of the Melic of Hormos.

This Melic has also a castle which is still stronger than the city, and
has a better command of the entry to the Gulf.{3}

The people of this country live on dates and salt fish, which they have
in great abundance; the nobles, however, have better fare.

There is no more to say on this subject. So now let us go on and speak
of the city of Hormos, of which we told you before.


  NOTE 1.—_Ḳalhát_, the _Calaiate_ of the old Portuguese writers,
  is about 500 m. by shortest _sea-line_ north-east of Dhafár. “The
  city of Kalhát,” says Ibn Batuta, “stands on the shore; it has
  fine bazaars, and one of the most beautiful mosques that you could
  see anywhere, the walls of which are covered with enamelled tiles
  of Káshán.... The city is inhabited by merchants, who draw their
  support from Indian import trade.... Although they are Arabs, they
  don’t speak correctly. After every phrase they have a habit of
  adding the particle _no_. Thus they will say ‘You are eating,— no?’
  ‘You are walking,—no?’ ‘You are doing this or that,—no?’ Most of
  them are schismatics, but they cannot openly practise their tenets,
  for they are under the rule of Sultan Kutbuddin Tehemten Malik, of
  Hormuz, who is orthodox” (II. 226).

  _Calaiate_, when visited by d’Alboquerque, showed by its buildings
  and ruins that it had been a noble city. Its destruction was
  ascribed to an earthquake. (_De Barros_, II. ii. 1.) It seems to
  exist no longer. Wellsted says its remains cover a wide space; but
  only one building, an old mosque, has escaped destruction. Near the
  ruins is a small fishing village, the people of which also dig for
  gold coins. (_J. R. G. S_. VII. 104.)

  What is said about the Prince of Hormuz betaking himself to Kalhát
  in times of trouble is quite in accordance with what we read
  in Teixeira’s abstract of the Hormuz history. When expelled by
  revolution at Hormuz or the like, we find the princes taking refuge
  at Kalhát.

  NOTE 2.—“Of the interior.” Here the phrase of the G. T. is again
  “en fra tere _a mainte cité et castiaus_.” (See _supra_, Bk. I. ch.
  i. note 2.)

  There was still a large horse-trade from Kalhát in 1517, but the
  Portuguese compelled all to enter the port of Goa, where according
  to Andrea Corsali they had to pay a duty of 40 _saraffi_ per head.
  If these _ashrafis_ were pagodas, this would be about 15_l._ a
  head; if they were _dinárs_, it would be more than 20_l._ The term
  is _now_ commonly applied in Hindustan to the gold mohr.

  NOTE 3.—This no doubt is Maskat.




                              CHAPTER XL.

       RETURNS TO THE CITY OF HORMOS WHEREOF WE SPOKE FORMERLY.


When you leave the City of Calatu, and go for 300 miles between
north-west and north, you come to the city of Hormos; a great and noble
city on the sea.{1} It has a _Melic_, which is as much as to say a
King, and he is under the Soldan of Kerman.

There are a good many cities and towns belonging to Hormos, and the
people are Saracens. The heat is tremendous, and on that account their
houses are built with ventilators to catch the wind. These ventilators
are placed on the side from which the wind comes, and they bring the
wind down into the house to cool it. But for this the heat would be
utterly unbearable.{2}

I shall say no more about these places, because I formerly told you in
regular order all about this same city of Hormos, and about Kerman as
well. But as we took one way to go, and another to come back, it was
proper that we should bring you a second time to this point.

Now, however, we will quit this part of the world, and tell you about
Great Turkey. First, however, there is a point that I have omitted; to
wit, that when you leave the City of Calatu and go between west and
north-west, a distance of 500 miles, you come to the city of Kis.{3} Of
that, however, we shall say no more now, but pass it with this brief
mention, and return to the subject of Great Turkey, of which you shall
now hear.


  NOTE 1.—The distance is very correct; and the bearing fairly so
  for the first time since we left Aden. I have tried in my map of
  Polo’s Geography to realise what seems to have been his idea of the
  Arabian coast.

  NOTE 2.—These ventilators are a kind of masonry windsail, known
  as _Bád-gír_, or “wind-catchers,” and in general use over Oman,
  Kerman, the province of Baghdad, Mekrán, and Sind. A large and
  elaborate example, from Hommaire de Hell’s work on Persia, is given
  in the cut above. Very particular accounts of these ventilators
  will be found in P. della Valle, and in the embassy of Don Garcias
  de Silva Figueroa. (_Della Val._ II. 333–335; _Figueroa_, Fr.
  Trans. 1667, p. 38; _Ramus._ I. 293 v.; _Macd. Kinneir_, p. 69.) A
  somewhat different arrangement for the same purpose is in use in
  Cairo, and gives a very peculiar character to the city when seen
  from a moderate height.

  [“The structures [at Gombroon] are all plain atop, only
  _Ventoso’s_, or Funnels, for to let in the Air, the only thing
  requisite to living in this fiery Furnace with any comfort;
  wherefore no House is left without this contrivance; which shews
  gracefully at a distance on Board Ship, and makes the Town appear
  delightful enough to Beholders, giving at once a pleasing Spectacle
  to Strangers, and kind Refreshment to the Inhabitants; for they are
  not only elegantly Adorned without, but conveniently Adapted for
  every Apartment to receive the cool Wind within.” (_John Fryer,
  Nine Years’ Travels_, Lond., 1698, p. 222.)]

  NOTE 3.—On _Kish_ see Book I. ch. vi. note 2.

  [Chao Ju-kua (transl. in German by Dr. F. Hirth, _T’oung
  Pao_, V. Supp. p. 40), a Chinese Official of the Sung Dynasty,
  says regarding Kish: “The land of _Ki-shih_ (Kish) lies upon a
  rocky island in the sea, in sight of the coast of Ta-shih, at
  half-a-day’s journey. There are but four towns in its territories.
  When the King shows himself out of doors, he rides a horse under
  a black canopy, with an escort of 100 servants. The inhabitants
  are white and of a pure race and eight Chinese feet tall. They
  wear under a Turban their hair loose partly hanging on their neck.
  Their dress consists of a foreign jacket and a light silk or cotton
  overcoat, with red leather shoes. They use gold and silver coins.
  Their food consists of wheaten bread, mutton, fish and dates;
  they do not eat rice. The country produces pearls and horses of a
  superior quality.”—H. C.]

  The Turkish Admiral Sidi ’Ali, who was sent in 1553 to command
  the Ottoman fleet in the Persian Gulf, and has written an
  interesting account of his disastrous command and travels back to
  Constantinople from India, calls the Island Ḳais, or “_the old
  Hormuz_.” This shows that the traditions of the origin of the
  island of Hormuz had grown dim. _Kish_ had preceded Hormuz as the
  most prominent port of Indian trade, but old Hormuz, as we have
  seen (Bk. I. ch. xix.), was quite another place. (_J. As._ sér. 1,

                              CHAPTER I.

                       CONCERNING GREAT TURKEY.


In GREAT TURKEY there is a king called CAIDU, who is the Great Kaan’s
nephew, for he was the grandson of CHAGATAI, the Great Kaan’s own
brother. He hath many cities and castles, and is a great Prince. He and
his people are Tartars alike; and they are good soldiers, for they are
constantly engaged in war.{1}

Now this King Caidu is never at peace with his uncle the Great Kaan,
but ever at deadly war with him, and he hath fought great battles with
the Kaan’s armies. The quarrel between them arose out of this, that
Caidu demanded from the Great Kaan the share of his father’s conquests
that of right belonged to him; and in particular he demanded a share of
the Provinces of Cathay and Manzi. The Great Kaan replied that he was
willing enough to give him a share such as he gave to his own sons, but
that he must first come on summons to the Council at the Kaan’s Court,
and present himself as one of the Kaan’s liegemen. Caidu, who did not
trust his uncle very far, declined to come, but said that where he was
he would hold himself ready to obey all the Kaan’s commands.

In truth, as he had several times been in revolt, he dreaded that
the Kaan might take the opportunity to destroy him. So, out of this
quarrel between them, there arose a great war, and several great
battles were fought by the host of Caidu against the host of the Great
Kaan, his uncle. And the Great Kaan from year’s end to year’s end keeps
an army watching all Caidu’s frontier, lest he should make forays on
his dominions. He, natheless, will never cease his aggressions on the
Great Kaan’s territory, and maintains a bold face to his enemies.{2}

Indeed, he is so potent that he can well do so; for he can take the
field with 100,000 horse, all stout soldiers and inured to war. He
has also with him several Barons of the imperial lineage; _i.e._,
of the family of Chinghis Kaan, who was the first of their lords,
and conquered a great part of the world, as I have told you more
particularly in a former part of this Book.

Now you must know that Great Turkey lies towards the north-west
when you travel from Hormos by that road I described. It begins on
the further bank of the River JON,[1] and extends northward to the
territory of the Great Kaan.

Now I shall tell you of sundry battles that the troops of Caidu fought
with the armies of the Great Kaan.


  NOTE 1.—We see that Polo’s error as to the relationship between
  Kúblái and Kaidu, and as to the descent of the latter (see Vol.
  I. p. 186) was not a slip, but persistent. The name of Kaidu’s
  grandfather is here in the G. T. written precisely Chagatai
  (_Ciagatai_).

  Kaidu was the son of Kashin, son of Okkodai, who was the third son
  of Chinghiz and his successor in the Kaanate. Kaidu never would
  acknowledge the supremacy of Kúblái, alleging his own superior
  claim to the Kaanate, which Chinghiz was said to have restricted to
  the house of Okkodai as long as it should have a representative.
  From the vicinity of Kaidu’s position to the territories occupied
  by the branch of Chaghatai he exercised great influence over
  its princes, and these were often his allies in the constant
  hostilities that he maintained against the Kaan. Such circumstances
  may have led Polo to confound Kaidu with the house of Chaghatai.
  Indeed, it is not easy to point out the mutual limits of their
  territories, and these must have been somewhat complex, for we find
  Kaidu and Borrak Khan of Chaghatai at one time exercising a kind of
  joint sovereignty in the cities of Bokhara and Samarkand. Probably,
  indeed, the limits were in a great measure _tribal_ rather than
  territorial. But it may be gathered that Kaidu’s authority extended
  over Kashgar and the cities bordering the south slopes of the
  Thian Shan as far east as Kara Khoja, also the valley of the Talas
  River, and the country north of the Thian Shan from Lake Balkhash
  eastward to the vicinity of Barkul, and in the further north the
  country between the Upper Yenisei and the Irtish.

  Kaidu died in 1301 at a very great age. He had taken part, it
  was said, in 41 pitched battles. He left 14 sons (some accounts
  say 40), of whom the eldest, called Shabar, succeeded him. He
  joined Dua Khan of Chaghatai in making submission to Teimur Kaan,
  the successor of Kúblái; but before long, on a quarrel occurring
  between the two former, Dua seized the territory of Shabar, and as
  far as I can learn no more is heard of the house of Kaidu. Vámbéry
  seems to make the Khans of Khokand to be of the stock of Kaidu; but
  whether they claim descent from Yúnus Khán, as he says, or from a
  son of Baber left behind in his flight from Ferghána, as Pandit
  Manphúl states, the genealogy would be from Chaghatai, not from
  Kaidu.

  NOTE 2.—“To the N.N.W. a desert of 40 days’ extent divides the
  states of Kúblái from those of Kaidu and Dua. This frontier extends
  for 30 days’ journey from east to west. From point to point,” etc.;

                              CHAPTER II.

     OF CERTAIN BATTLES THAT WERE FOUGHT BY KING CAIDU AGAINST THE
                  ARMIES OF HIS UNCLE THE GREAT KAAN.


Now it came to pass in the year of Christ’s incarnation, 1266, that
this King Caidu and another prince called YESUDAR, who was his cousin,
assembled a great force and made an expedition to attack two of the
Great Kaan’s Barons who held lands under the Great Kaan, but were
Caidu’s own kinsmen, for they were sons of Chagatai who was a baptized
Christian, and own brother to the Great Kaan; one of them was called
CHIBAI, and the other CHIBAN.{1}

Caidu with all his host, amounting to 60,000 horse, engaged the Kaan’s
two Barons, those cousins of his, who had also a great force amounting
to more than 60,000 horsemen, and there was a great battle. In the end
the Barons were beaten, and Caidu and his people won the day. Great
numbers were slain on both sides, but the two brother Barons escaped,
thanks to their good horses. So King Caidu returned home swelling the
more with pride and arrogance, and for the next two years he remained
at peace, and made no further war against the Kaan.

However, at the end of those two years King Caidu assembled an army
composed of a vast force of horsemen. He knew that at Caracoron was
the Great Kaan’s son NOMOGAN, and with him GEORGE, the grandson of
Prester John. These two princes had also a great force of cavalry. And
when King Caidu was ready he set forth and crossed the frontier. After
marching rapidly without any adventure, he got near Caracoron, where
the Kaan’s son and the younger Prester John were awaiting him with
their great army, for they were well aware of Caidu’s advance in force.
They made them ready for battle like valiant men, and all undismayed,
seeing that they had more than 60,000 well-appointed horsemen. And
when they heard Caidu was so near they went forth valiantly to meet
him. When they got within some 10 miles of him they pitched their
tents and got ready for battle, and the enemy who were about equal in
numbers did the same; each side forming in six columns of 10,000 men
with good captains. Both sides were well equipped with swords and maces
and shields, with bows and arrows, and other arms after their fashion.
You must know that the practice of the Tartars going to battle is to
take each a bow and 60 arrows. Of these, 30 are light with small sharp
points, for long shots and following up an enemy, whilst the other 30
are heavy, with large broad heads which they shoot at close quarters,
and with which they inflict great gashes on face and arms, and cut the
enemy’s bowstrings, and commit great havoc. This every one is ordered
to attend to. And when they have shot away their arrows they take to
their swords and maces and lances, which also they ply stoutly.

So when both sides were ready for action the Naccaras began to sound
loudly, one on either side. For ’tis their custom never to join battle
till the Great Naccara is beaten. And when the Naccaras sounded, then
the battle began in fierce and deadly style, and furiously the one
host dashed to meet the other. So many fell on either side that in an
evil hour for both it was begun! The earth was thickly strewn with the
wounded and the slain, men and horses, whilst the uproar and din of
battle was so loud you would not have heard God’s thunder! Truly King
Caidu himself did many a deed of prowess that strengthened the hearts
of his people. Nor less on the other side did the Great Kaan’s son
and Prester John’s grandson, for well they proved their valour in the
medley, and did astonishing feats of arms, leading their troops with
right good judgment.

And what shall I tell you? The battle lasted so long that it was one of
the hardest the Tartars ever fought. Either side strove hard to bring
the matter to a point and rout the enemy, but to no avail. And so the
battle went on till vesper-tide, and without victory on either side.
Many a man fell there; many a child was made an orphan there; many a
lady widowed; and many another woman plunged in grief and tears for the
rest of her days, I mean the mothers and the _araines_ of those who
fell.{2}

So when they had fought till the sun was low they left off, and retired
each side to its tents. Those who were unhurt were so dead tired that
they were like to drop, and the wounded, who were many on both sides,
were moaning in their various degrees of pain; but all were more fit
for rest than fighting, so gladly they took their repose that night.
And when morning approached, King Caidu, who had news from his scouts
that the Great Kaan was sending a great army to reinforce his son,
judged that it was time to be off; so he called his host to saddle and
mounted his horse at dawn, and away they set on their return to their
own country. And when the Great Kaan’s son and the grandson of Prester
John saw that King Caidu had retired with all his host, they let them
go unpursued, for they were themselves sorely fatigued and needed rest.
So King Caidu and his host rode and rode, till they came to their own
realm of Great Turkey and to Samarcand; and there they abode a long
while without again making war.{3}


  NOTE 1.—The names are uncertain. The G. T. has “one of whom was
  called Tibai or Ciban”; Pauthier, as in the text.

  The phrase about their being Kaidu’s kinsmen is in the G. T., “_qe_
  zinzinz (?) _meisme estoient de Caidu roi_.”

  NOTE 2.—_Araines_ for _Haríms_, I presume. In the narrative of a
  merchant in Ramusio (II. 84, 86) we find the same word represented
  by _Arin_ and _Arino_.

  NOTE 3.—The date at the beginning of the chapter is in G. T.,
  and Pauthier’s MS. A, as we have given it. Pauthier substitutes
  1276, as that seems to be the date approximately connecting Prince
  Numughan with the wars against Kaidu. In 1275 Kúblái appointed
  Numughan to the command of his N.W. frontier, with Ngantung
  or ’Antung, an able general, to assist him in repelling the
  aggressions of Kaidu. In the same year Kaidu and Dua Khan entered
  the Uighúr country (W. and N.W. of Kamul), with more than 100,000
  men. Two years later, viz., in 1277, Kaidu and Shireghi, a son of
  Mangu Khan, engaged near Almalik (on the Ili) the troops of Kúblái,
  commanded by Numughan and ’Antung, and took both of them prisoners.
  The invaders then marched towards Karakorum. But Bayan, who was in
  Mongolia, marched to attack them, and completely defeated them in
  several engagements. (_Gaubil_, 69, 168, 182.)

  Pauthier gives a little more detail from the Chinese annals, but
  throws no new light on the discrepancies which we see between
  Polo’s account and theirs. ’Antung, who was the grandson of Mokli,
  the Jelair, one of Chinghiz’s Orlok or Marshals, seems here to take
  the place assigned to Prester John’s grandson, and Shireghi perhaps
  that of Yesudar. The only prince of the latter name that I can find
  is a son of Hulaku’s.

  The description of the battle in this chapter is a mere formula
  again and again repeated. The armies are always exactly or nearly
  equal, they are always divided into corps of 10,000 (_tomans_),
  they always halt to prepare for action when within ten miles of one
  another, and the terms used in describing the fight are the same.
  We shall not inflict these tiresome repetitions again on the reader.

                              HIS NEPHEW.

                              CHAPTER IV.

           OF THE EXPLOITS OF KING CAIDU’S VALIANT DAUGHTER.


Now you must know that King Caidu had a daughter whose name was
AIJARUC, which in the Tartar is as much as to say “The Bright Moon.”
This damsel was very beautiful, but also so strong and brave that in
all her father’s realm there was no man who could outdo her in feats
of strength. In all trials she showed greater strength than any man of
them.{1}

Her father often desired to give her in marriage, but she would none
of it. She vowed she would never marry till she found a man who could
vanquish her in every trial; him she would wed and none else. And when
her father saw how resolute she was, he gave a formal consent in their
fashion, that she should marry whom she list and when she list. The
lady was so tall and muscular, so stout and shapely withal, that she
was almost like a giantess. She had distributed her challenges over all
the kingdoms, declaring that whosoever should come to try a fall with
her, it should be on these conditions, viz., that if she vanquished him
she should win from him 100 horses, and if he vanquished her he should
win her to wife. Hence many a noble youth had come to try his strength
against her, but she beat them all; and in this way she had won more
than 10,000 horses.

Now it came to pass in the year of Christ 1280 that there presented
himself a noble young gallant, the son of a rich and puissant king, a
man of prowess and valiance and great strength of body, who had heard
word of the damsel’s challenge, and came to match himself against her
in the hope of vanquishing her and winning her to wife. That he greatly
desired, for the young lady was passing fair. He, too, was young and
handsome, fearless and strong in every way, insomuch that not a man in
all his father’s realm could vie with him. So he came full confidently,
and brought with him 1000 horses to be forfeited if she should vanquish
him. Thus might she gain 1000 horses at a single stroke! But the
young gallant had such confidence in his own strength that he counted
securely to win her.

Now ye must know that King Caidu and the Queen his wife, the mother of
the stout damsel, did privily beseech their daughter to let herself be
vanquished. For they greatly desired this prince for their daughter,
seeing what a noble youth he was, and the son of a great king. But the
damsel answered that never would she let herself be vanquished if she
could help it; if, indeed, he should get the better of her then she
would gladly be his wife, according to the wager, but not otherwise.

So a day was named for a great gathering at the Palace of King Caidu,
and the King and Queen were there. And when all the company were
assembled, for great numbers flocked to see the match, the damsel
first came forth in a strait jerkin of sammet; and then came forth the
young bachelor in a jerkin of sendal; and a winsome sight they were to
see. When both had taken post in the middle of the hall they grappled
each other by the arms and wrestled this way and that, but for a long
time neither could get the better of the other. At last, however, it
so befel that the damsel threw him right valiantly on the palace
pavement. And when he found himself thus thrown, and her standing
over him, great indeed was his shame and discomfiture. He gat him up
straightway, and without more ado departed with all his company, and
returned to his father, full of shame and vexation, that he who had
never yet found a man that could stand before him should have been thus
worsted by a girl! And his 1000 horses he left behind him.

As to King Caidu and his wife they were greatly annoyed, as I can tell
you; for if they had had their will this youth should have won their
daughter.

And ye must know that after this her father never went on a campaign
but she went with him. And gladly he took her, for not a knight in all
his train played such feats of arms as she did. Sometimes she would
quit her father’s side, and make a dash at the host of the enemy, and
seize some man thereout, as deftly as a hawk pounces on a bird, and
carry him to her father; and this she did many a time.

Now I will leave this story and tell you of a great battle that Caidu
fought with Argon the son of Abaga, Lord of the Tartars of the Levant.


  NOTE 1.—The name of the lady is in Pauthier’s MSS. _Agiaint,
  Agyanie_; in the Bern, _Agyanic_; in the MS. of the G. T.,
  distinctly _Aigiaruc_, though printed in the edition of 1824 as
  _Aigiarm_. It is Oriental Turkish, AI-YÁRÚḲ, signifying precisely
  _Lucent Lune_, as Marco explains it. For this elucidation I am
  indebted to the kindness of Professor Vámbéry, who adds that the
  name is in actual use among the Uzbek women.

  Kaidu had many sons, but only one daughter, whom Rashiduddin (who
  seems to be Hammer’s authority here) calls _Kutulun_. Her father
  loved her above all his sons; she used to accompany him to the
  field, and aid in state affairs. Letters were exchanged between
  her and Gházán Khan, in which she assured him she would marry no
  one else; but her father refused her hand to all suitors. After
  Kaidu’s death, this ambitious lady made some attempt to claim the
  succession. (_Hammer’s Ilkhans_, II. 143–144.)

  The story has some resemblance to what Ibn Batuta relates of
  another warlike Princess, Urdúja, whom he professes to have visited
  in the questionable kingdom of Tawálisi on his way to China: “I
  heard ... that various sons of kings had sought Urduja’s hand,
  but she always answered, ‘I will marry no one but him who shall
  fight and conquer me’; so they all avoided the trail, for fear of
  the shame of being beaten by her.” (_I. B._ IV. 253–254.) I have
  given reasons (_Cathay_, p. 520) for suspecting that this lady
  with a Turkish name in the Indian Archipelago is a bit of fiction.
  Possibly Ibn Batuta had heard the legend of King Kaidu’s daughter.

  The story of Kaidu’s daughter, and still more the parallel one from
  Ibn Batuta, recall what Herodotus tells of the Sauromatae, who
  had married the Amazons; that no girl was permitted to marry till
  she had killed an enemy (IV. 117). They recall still more closely
  Brunhild, in the Nibelungen:—

          ——“a royal maiden who reigned beyond the sea:
    From sunrise to the sundown no paragon had she.
    All boundless as her beauty was her strength was peerless too,
    And evil plight hung o’er the knight who dared her love to woo.
    For he must try three bouts with her; the whirling spear to fling;
    To pitch the massive stone; and then to follow with a spring;
    And should he beat in every feat his wooing well has sped,
    But he who fails must lose his love, and likewise lose his head.”




                              CHAPTER V.

      HOW ABAGA SENT HIS SON ARGON IN COMMAND AGAINST KING CAIDU.


Abaga the Lord of the Levant had many districts and provinces bordering
on King Caidu’s territories. These lay in the direction of the _Arbre
Sol_, which the Book of Alexander calls the _Arbre Sec_, about which
I have told you before. And Abaga, to watch against forays by Caidu’s
people sent his son Argon with a great force of horsemen, to keep the
marches between the Arbre Sec and the River Jon. So there tarried Argon
with all his host.{1}

Now it came to pass that King Caidu assembled a great army and made
captain thereof a brother of his called Barac, a brave and prudent man,
and sent his host under his brother to fight with Argon.{2}

⚜ (Barac and his army cross the Jon or Oxus and are totally routed by
Argon, to whose history the traveller now turns.)


  NOTE 1.—The Government of this frontier, from Kazwin or Rei to
  the banks of the Oxus, was usually, under the Mongol sovereigns
  of Persia, confided to the heir of the throne. Thus, under Hulaku
  it was held by Ábáká, under Ábáká by Arghún, and under Arghún by
  Gházán. (See _Hammer, passim._)

  We have already spoken amply of the Arbre Sol (vol. i. p. 128
  _seqq._).

  NOTE 2.—Barac or Borrak, who has been already spoken of in ch. iii.
  of the Prologue (vol. i. p. 10), was no brother of Kaidu’s. He was
  the head of the house of Chaghatai, and in alliance with Kaidu.
  The invasion of Khorasan by Borrak took place in the early part
  of 1269. Arghún was only about 15, and his father Ábáká came to
  take the command in person. The battle seems to have been fought
  somewhere near the upper waters of the Murghab, in the territory of
  the Badghís (north of Herat). Borrak was not long after driven from
  power, and took refuge with Kaidu. He died, it is said from poison,
  in 1270.




                              CHAPTER VI.

      HOW ARGON AFTER THE BATTLE HEARD THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD,
         AND WENT TO ASSUME THE SOVEREIGNTY AS WAS HIS RIGHT.


After Argon had gained this battle over Caidu’s brother Barac and his
host, no long time passed before he had news that his father Abaga was
dead, whereat he was sorely grieved.{1} He made ready his army and set
out for his father’s Court to assume the sovereignty as was his right;
but he had a march of 40 days to reach it.

Now it befel that an uncle of Argon’s whose name was ACOMAT SOLDAN (for
he had become a Saracen), when he heard of the death of his brother
Abaga, whilst his nephew Argon was so far away, thought there was a
good chance for him to seize the government. So he raised a great force
and went straight to the Court of his late brother Abaga, and seized
the sovereignty and proclaimed himself King; and also got possession of
the treasure, which was of vast amount. All this, like a crafty knave,
he divided among the Barons and the troops to secure their hearts and
favour to his cause. These Barons and soldiers accordingly, when they
saw what large spoil they had got from him, were all ready to say he
was the best of kings, and were full of love for him, and declared they
would have no lord but him. But he did one evil thing that was greatly
reprobated by all; for he took all the wives of his brother Abaga, and
kept them for himself.{2}

Soon after he had seized the government, word came to him how Argon
his nephew was advancing with all his host. Then he tarried not, but
straightway summoned his Barons and all his people, and in a week had
fitted out a great army of horse to go to meet Argon. And he went forth
light of heart, as being confident of victory, showing no dismay, and
saying on all occasions that he desired nought so much as to take
Argon, and put him to a cruel death.{3}


  NOTE 1.—Ábáḳá died at Hamadan 1st April 1282, twelve years after
  the defeat of Borrak.

  NOTE 2.—This last sentence is in Pauthier’s text, but not in the G.
  T. The thing was a regular Tartar custom (vol. i. pp. 253, 256),
  and would scarcely be “reprobated by all.”

  NOTE 3.—Acomat Soldan is AHMAD, a younger son of Hulaku, whose
  Mongol name was Tigúdar, and who had been baptized in his youth by
  the name of Nicolas, but went over to Islam, and thereby gained
  favour in Persia. On the death of his brother Ábáká he had a strong
  party and seized the throne. Arghún continued in sullen defiance,
  gathering means to assist his claim.

And when Acomat Soldan had heard the message of Argon his nephew, he
thus replied: “Sirs and envoys,” quoth he, “my nephew’s words are vain;
for the land is mine, not his, and I helped to conquer it as much as
his father did. So go and tell my nephew that if he will I will make
him a great Prince, and give him ample lands, and he shall be as my
son, and the greatest lord in the land after myself. But if he will
not, let him be assured that I will do my best to bring him to his
death! That is my answer to my nephew, and nought else of concession
or covenant shall you ever have from me!” With that Acomat ceased, and
said no word more. And when the Envoys had heard the Soldan’s words
they asked again: “Is there no hope that we shall find you in different
mind?” “Never,” quoth he, “never whilst I live shall ye find my mind
changed.”

⚜ (There is a prolix description of a battle almost identical with
those already given in Chapter II. of this Book and previously. It ends
with the rout of Argon’s army, and proceeds:)

And in the pursuit Argon was taken. As soon as this happened they gave
up the chase, and returned to their camp full of joy and exultation.
Acomat first caused his nephew to be shackled and well guarded, and
then, being a man of great lechery, said to himself that he would go
and enjoy himself among the fair women of his Court. He left a great
Melic{1} in command of his host, enjoining him to guard Argon like his
own life, and to follow to the Court by short marches, to spare the
troops. And so Acomat departed with a great following, on his way to
the royal residence. Thus then Acomat had left his host in command of
that Melic whom I mentioned, whilst Argon remained in irons, and in
such bitterness of heart that he desired to die.{2}


  NOTE 1.—This is in the original _Belic_, for Melic, _i.e._ Ar.
  _Malik_, chief or prince.

  NOTE 2.—In the spring of 1284 Ahmad marched against his nephew
  Arghún, and they encountered in the plain of Aḳ Khoja, near Kazwin.
  Arghún’s force was very inferior in numbers, and he was defeated.
  He fled to the Castle of Kala’at beyond Tús, but was persuaded
  to surrender. Ahmad treated him kindly, and though his principal
  followers urged the execution of the prisoner, he refused, having
  then, it is said, no thought for anything but the charms of his new
  wife Tudai.




                             CHAPTER XIII.

                 HOW ARGON WAS DELIVERED FROM PRISON.


Now it befel that there was a great Tartar Baron, a very aged man, who
took pity on Argon, saying to himself that they were doing an evil
and disloyal deed in keeping their lawful lord a prisoner, wherefore
he resolved to do all in his power for his deliverance. So he tarried
not, but went incontinently to certain other Barons and told them his
mind, saying that it would be a good deed to deliver Argon and make him
their lord, as he was by right. And when the other Barons had heard
what he had to put before them, then both because they regarded him
as one of the wisest men among them, and because what he said was the
truth, they all consented to his proposal and said that they would
join with all their hearts. So when the Barons had assented, BOGA
(which was he who had set the business going), and with him ELCHIDAI,
TOGAN, TEGANA, TAGACHAR, ULATAI, and SAMAGAR,—all those whom I have now
named,—proceeded to the tent where Argon lay a prisoner. When they had
got thither, Boga, who was the leader in the business, spoke first, and
to this effect: “Good my Lord Argon,” said he, “we are well aware that
we have done ill in making you a prisoner, and we come to tell you that
we desire to return to Right and Justice. We come therefore to set you
free, and to make you our Liege Lord as by right you are!” Then Boga
ceased and said no more.

                HOW ARGON GOT THE SOVEREIGNTY AT LAST.


When Argon heard the words of Boga he took them in truth for an
untimely jest, and replied with much bitterness of soul: “Good my
Lord,” quoth he, “you do ill to mock me thus! Surely it suffices that
you have done me so great wrong already, and that you hold me, your
lawful Lord, here a prisoner and in chains! Ye know well, as I cannot
doubt, that you are doing an evil and a wicked thing, so I pray you
go your way, and cease to flout me.” “Good my Lord Argon,” said Boga,
“be assured we are not mocking you, but are speaking in sober earnest,
and we will swear it on our Law.” Then all the Barons swore fealty to
him as their Lord, and Argon too swore that he would never reckon it
against them that they had taken him prisoner, but would hold them as
dear as his father before him had done.

And when these oaths had passed they struck off Argon’s fetters, and
hailed him as their lord. Argon then desired them to shoot a volley
of arrows into the tent of the Melic who had held them prisoners, and
who was in command of the army, that he might be slain. At his word
they tarried not, but straightway shot a great number of arrows at the
tent, and so slew the Melic. When that was done Argon took the supreme
command and gave his orders as sovereign, and was obeyed by all. And
you must know that the name of him who was slain, whom we have called
the Melic, was SOLDAN; and he was the greatest Lord after Acomat
himself. In this way that you have heard, Argon recovered his authority.

escapes to seek shelter with the Sultan of Babylon, _i.e._ of Egypt,

which he had to go, seeing the state of things, arrests him and carries
him to the Court (probably Tabriz), where Argon was already arrived.)

And so when the Officer of the Pass came before Argon bringing Acomat
captive, he was in a great state of exultation, and welcomed his uncle
with a malediction,[1] saying that he should have his deserts. And he
straightway ordered the army to be assembled before him, and without
taking counsel with any one, commanded the prisoner to be put to death,
and his body to be destroyed. So the officer appointed to this duty
took Acomat away and put him to death, and threw his body where it
never was seen again.

And when Argon had done as you have heard, and remained in possession
of the Throne and of the Royal Palace, all the Barons of the different
Provinces, who had been subject to his father Abaga, came and performed
homage before him, and obeyed him, as was his due.{1} And after Argon
was well established in the sovereignty he sent CASAN, his son, with
30,000 horse to the _Arbre Sec_, I mean to the region so-called, to
watch the frontier. Thus then Argon got back the government. And
you must know that Argon began his reign in the year 1286 of the
Incarnation of Jesus Christ. Acomat had reigned two years, and Argon
reigned six years; and at the end of those six years he became ill and
died; but some say ’twas of poison.{2}


  NOTE 1.—Arghún, a prisoner (see last note), and looking for the
  worst, was upheld by his courageous wife BULUGHÁN (see Prologue,
  ch. xvii.), who shared his confinement. The order for his
  execution, as soon as the camp should next move, had been issued.

  BUKA the Jelair, who had been a great chief under Ábáká, and had
  resentments against Ahmad, got up a conspiracy in favour of Arghún,
  and effected his release as well as the death of ALINAK, Ahmad’s
  commander-in-chief. Ahmad fled towards Tabriz, pursued by a band
  of the Karaunas, who succeeded in taking him. When Arghún came
  near and saw his uncle in their hands, he called out in exultation
  _Morio!_—an exclamation, says Wassáf, which the Mongols used when
  successful in archery,—and with a gesture gave the signal for the
  prisoner’s death (10th August 1284).

  Buka is of course the _Boga_ of Polo; Alinak is his _Soldan_. The
  conspirators along with Buka, who are named in the history of
  Wassáf, are _Yesubuka_, _Gurgán_, _Aruk_, _Kurmishi_, and _Arkasun
  Noian_. Those named by Polo are not mentioned on this occasion,
  but the names are all Mongol. TAGÁJAR, ILCHIDAI, TUGHAN, SAMAGHAR,
  all appear in the Persian history of those times. Tagajar appears
  to have had the honour of a letter from the Pope (Nicolas IV.) in
  1291, specially exhorting him to adopt the Christian faith; it was
  sent along with letters of like tenor addressed to Arghún, Gházán,
  and other members of the imperial family. Tagajar is also mentioned
  by the continuator of Abulfaraj as engaged in the conspiracy to
  dethrone Kaikhátú. ULATAI was probably the same who went a few
  years later as Arghún’s ambassador to Cambaluc (see Prologue, ch.
  xvii.); and Polo may have heard the story from him on board ship.

  (_Assem._ III. pt. 2, 118; _Mosheim_, p. 80; _Ilchan._, passim.)

  Abulfaragius gives a fragment of a letter from Arghún to Kúblái,
  reporting the deposition of Ahmad by the princes because he had
  “apostatized from the law of their fathers, and adopted that of the
  Arabs.” (_Assemani_, _u.s._ p. 116.) The same historian says that
  Ahmad was kind and liberal to the Christians, though Hayton speaks
  differently.

  NOTE 2.—Arghún obtained the throne on Ahmad’s death, as just
  related, and soon after named his son Gházán (born in 1271) to
  the Government of Khorasan, Mazanderan, Kumis, and Rei. Buka was
  made Chief Minister. The circumstances of Arghún’s death have been
  noticed already (_supra_, p. 369).

        HOW KIACATU SEIZED THE SOVEREIGNTY AFTER ARGON’S DEATH.


And immediately on Argon’s death, an uncle of his who was own
brother[1] to Abaga his father, seized the throne, as he found it easy
to do owing to Casan’s being so far away as the _Arbre Sec_. When Casan
heard of his father’s death he was in great tribulation, and still
more when he heard of KIACATU’S seizing the throne. He could not then
venture to leave the frontier for fear of his enemies, but he vowed
that when time and place should suit he would go and take as great
vengeance as his father had taken on Acomat. And what shall I tell you?
Kiacatu continued to rule, and all obeyed him except such as were along
with Casan. Kiacatu took the wife of Argon for his own, and was always
dallying with women, for he was a great lechour. He held the throne for
two years, and at the end of those two years he died; for you must know
he was poisoned.{1}


  NOTE 1.—KAIKHÁTÚ, of whom we heard in the Prologue (vol. i. p.
  35), was the brother, not the uncle, of Arghún. On the death of
  the latter there were three claimants, viz., his son Gházán, his
  brother Kaikhátú, and his cousin Baidu, the son of Tarakai, one
  of Hulaku’s sons. The party of Kaikhátú was strongest, and he was
  raised to the throne at Akhlath, 23rd July 1291. He took as wives
  out of the Royal Tents of Arghún the Ladies Bulughán (the 2nd,
  not her named in the Prologue) and Uruk. All the writers speak
  of Kaikhátú’s character in the same way. Hayton calls him “a man
  without law or faith, of no valour or experience in arms, but
  altogether given up to lechery and vice, living like a brute beast,
  glutting all his disordered appetites; for his dissolute life hated
  by his own people, and lightly regarded by foreigners.” (_Ram._
  II. ch. xxiv.) The continuator of Abulfaraj, and Abulfeda in his
  Annals, speak in like terms. (_Assem._ III. Pt. 2nd, 119–120;
  _Reiske_, _Ann. Abulf._ III. 101.)

  Baidu rose against him; most of his chiefs abandoned him, and he
  was put to death in March–April, 1295. He reigned therefore nearly
  four years, not _two_ as the text says.

                             CHAPTER XIX.

     HOW BAIDU SEIZED THE SOVEREIGNTY AFTER THE DEATH OF KIACATU.


When Kiacatu was dead, BAIDU, who was his uncle, and was a Christian,
seized the throne.{1} This was in the year 1294 of Christ’s
Incarnation. So Baidu held the government, and all obeyed him, except
only those who were with Casan.

And when Casan heard that Kiacatu was dead, and Baidu had seized the
throne, he was in great vexation, especially as he had not been able to
take his vengeance on Kiacatu. As for Baidu, Casan swore that he would
take such vengeance on him that all the world should speak thereof; and
he said to himself that he would tarry no longer, but would go at once
against Baidu and make an end of him. So he addressed all his people,
and then set out to get possession of his throne.

And when Baidu had intelligence thereof he assembled a great army and
got ready, and marched ten days to meet him, and then pitched his camp,
and awaited the advance of Casan to attack him; meanwhile addressing
many prayers and exhortations to his own people. He had not been halted
two days when Casan with all his followers arrived. And that very day a
fierce battle began. But Baidu was not fit to stand long against Casan,
and all the less that soon after the action began many of his troops
abandoned him and took sides with Casan. Thus Baidu was discomfited
and put to death, and Casan remained victor and master of all. For as
soon as he had won the battle and put Baidu to death, he proceeded to
the capital and took possession of the government; and all the Barons
performed homage and obeyed him as their liege lord. Casan began to
reign in the year 1294 of the Incarnation of Christ.

Thus then you have had the whole history from Abaga to Casan, and I
should tell you that Alaü, the conqueror of Baudac, and the brother
of the Great Kaan Cublay, was the progenitor of all those I have
mentioned. For he was the father of Abaga, and Abaga was the father of
Argon, and Argon was the father of Casan who now reigns.{2}

Now as we have told you all about the Tartars of the Levant, we will
quit them and go back and tell you more about Great Turkey— But in good
sooth we _have_ told you all about Great Turkey and the history of
Caidu, and there is really no more to tell. So we will go on and tell
you of the Provinces and nations in the far North.


  NOTE 1.—The Christian writers often ascribe Christianity to
  various princes of the Mongol dynasties without any good grounds.
  Certain coins of the Ilkhans of Persia, up to the time of Gházán’s
  conversion to Islam, exhibit sometimes Mahomedan and sometimes
  Christian formulæ, but this is no indication of the religion of
  the prince. Thus coins not merely of the heathen Khans Ábáká and
  Arghún, but of Ahmad Tigudar, the fanatical Moslem, are found
  inscribed “In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.”
  Raynaldus, under 1285, gives a fragment of a letter addressed by
  Arghún to the European Powers, and dated from Tabriz, “in the year
  of the Cock,” which begins “_In Christi Nomen, Amen!_” But just in
  like manner some of the coins of Norman kings of Sicily are said
  to bear the Mahomedan profession of faith; and the copper money of
  some of the Ghaznevide sultans bears the pagan effigy of the bull
  _Nandi_, borrowed from the coinage of the Hindu kings of Kabul.

  The European Princes could not get over the belief that the Mongols
  were necessarily the inveterate enemies of Mahomedanism and all its
  professors. Though Gházán was professedly a zealous Mussulman, we
  find King James of Aragon, in 1300, offering _Cassan Rey del Mogol_
  amity and alliance with much abuse of the infidel Saracens; and the
  same feeling is strongly expressed in a letter of Edward II. of
  England to the “Emperor of the Tartars,” which apparently was meant
  for Oljaitu, the successor of Gházán. (_Fraehn de Ilchan. Nummis_,
  vi. and _passim_; _Raynald._ III. 619; _J. A. S. B._ XXIV. 490;
  _Kington’s Frederick II._ I. 396; _Capmany_, _Antiguos Tratados_,
  etc. p. 107; _Rymer_, 2d Ed. III. 34; see also p. 20.)

  There are other assertions, besides our author’s, that Baidu
  professed Christianity. Hayton says so, and asserts that he
  prohibited Mahomedan proselytism among the Tartars. The continuator
  of Abulfaraj says that Baidu’s long acquaintance with the Greek
  _Despina Khatun_, the wife of Ábáká, had made him favourable to
  Christians, so that he willingly allowed a church to be carried
  about with the camp, and bells to be struck therein, but he never
  openly professed Christianity. In fact at this time the whole body
  of Mongols in Persia was passing over to Islam, and Baidu also, to
  please them, adopted Mahomedan practices. But he would only employ
  Christians as Ministers of State. His rival Gházán, on the other
  hand, strengthened his own influence by adopting Islam, Baidu’s
  followers fell off from him, and delivered him into Gházán’s power.
  He was put to death 4th of October, 1295, about seven months
  after the death of his predecessor. D’Ohsson’s authorities seem
  to mention no battle such as the text speaks of, but Mirkhond, as
  abridged by Teixeira, does so, and puts it at Nakshiwán on the
  Araxes (p. 341).

  NOTE 2.—Hayton testifies from his own knowledge to the remarkable
  personal beauty of Arghún, whilst he tells us that the son Gházán
  was as notable for the reverse. After recounting with great
  enthusiasm instances which he had witnessed of the daring and
  energy of Gházán, the Armenian author goes on, “And the most
  remarkable thing of all was that within a frame so small, and ugly
  almost to monstrosity, there should be assembled nearly all those
  high qualities which nature is wont to associate with a form of
  symmetry and beauty. In fact among all his host of 200,000 Tartars
  you should scarcely find one of smaller stature or of uglier and
  meaner aspect than this Prince.”

  [Illustration: Tomb of Oljaïtu Khan, the brother of Polo’s “Casan,”
    at Sultaniah. (From Fergusson.)]

  Pachymeres says that Gházán made Cyrus, Darius, and Alexander
  his patterns, and delighted to read of them. He was very fond of
  the mechanical arts; “no one surpassed him in making saddles,
  bridles, spurs, greaves, and helmets; he could hammer, stitch, and
  polish, and in such occupations employed the hours of his leisure
  from war.” The same author speaks of the purity and beauty of his
  coinage, and the excellence of his legislation. Of the latter, so
  famous in the East, an account at length is given by D’Ohsson.

  Before finally quitting the “Tartars of the Levant,” we give a
  representation of the finest work of architecture that they have
  left behind them, the tomb built for himself by Oljaïtu (see on
  this page), or, as his Moslem name ran, Mahomed Khodabandah, in the
  city of Sultaniah, which he founded. Oljaïtu was the brother and
  successor of Marco Polo’s friend Gházán, and died in 1316, eight
  years before our traveller.




                              CHAPTER XX.

            CONCERNING KING CONCHI WHO RULES THE FAR NORTH.


You must know that in the far north there is a King called CONCHI.
He is a Tartar, and all his people are Tartars, and they keep up the
regular Tartar religion. A very brutish one it is, but they keep it up
just the same as Chinghis Kaan and the proper Tartars did, so I will
tell you something of it.

You must know then that they make them a god of felt, and call him
NATIGAI; and they also make him a wife; and then they say that these
two divinities are the gods of the Earth who protect their cattle and
their corn and all their earthly goods. They pray to these figures, and
when they are eating a good dinner they rub the mouths of their gods
with the meat, and do many other stupid things.

The King is subject to no one, although he is of the Imperial lineage
of Chinghis Kaan, and a near kinsman of the Great Kaan.{1} This King
has neither city nor castle; he and his people live always either in
the wide plains or among great mountains and valleys. They subsist on
the milk and flesh of their cattle, and have no corn. The King has
a vast number of people, but he carries on no war with anybody, and
his people live in great tranquillity. They have enormous numbers of
cattle, camels, horses, oxen, sheep, and so forth.

You find in their country immense bears entirely white, and more than
20 palms in length. There are also large black foxes, wild asses, and
abundance of sables; those creatures I mean from the skins of which
they make those precious robes that cost 1000 bezants each. There are
also vairs in abundance; and vast multitudes of the Pharaoh’s rat, on
which the people live all the summer time. Indeed they have plenty of
all sorts of wild creatures, for the country they inhabit is very wild
and trackless.{2}

And you must know that this King possesses one tract of country which
is quite impassable for horses, for it abounds greatly in lakes and
springs, and hence there is so much ice as well as mud and mire, that
horses cannot travel over it. This difficult country is 13 days in
extent, and at the end of every day’s journey there is a post for
the lodgment of the couriers who have to cross this tract. At each
of these post-houses they keep some 40 dogs of great size, in fact
not much smaller than donkeys, and these dogs draw the couriers over
the day’s journey from post-house to post-house, and I will tell you
how. You see the ice and mire are so prevalent, that over this tract,
which lies for those 13 days’ journey in a great valley between two
mountains, no horses (as I told you) can travel, nor can any wheeled
carriage either. Wherefore they make sledges, which are carriages
without wheels, and made so that they can run over the ice, and also
over mire and mud without sinking too deep in it. Of these sledges
indeed there are many in our own country, for ’tis just such that are
used in winter for carrying hay and straw when there have been heavy
rains and the country is deep in mire. On such a sledge then they lay
a bear-skin on which the courier sits, and the sledge is drawn by six
of those big dogs that I spoke of. The dogs have no driver, but go
straight for the next post-house, drawing the sledge famously over ice
and mire. The keeper of the post-house however also gets on a sledge
drawn by dogs, and guides the party by the best and shortest way. And
when they arrive at the next station they find a new relay of dogs and
sledges ready to take them on, whilst the old relay turns back; and
thus they accomplish the whole journey across that region, always drawn
by dogs.{3}

The people who dwell in the valleys and mountains adjoining that tract
of 13 days’ journey are great huntsmen, and catch great numbers of
precious little beasts which are sources of great profit to them. Such
are the Sable, the Ermine, the Vair, the _Erculin_, the Black Fox, and
many other creatures from the skins of which the most costly furs are
prepared. They use traps to take them, from which they can’t escape.{4}
But in that region the cold is so great that all the dwellings of the
people are underground, and underground they always live.{5}

There is no more to say on this subject, so I shall proceed to tell you
of a region in that quarter, in which there is perpetual darkness.


  NOTE 1.—There are two KUWINJIS, or KAUNCHIS, as the name, from
  Polo’s representation of it, probably ought to be written,
  mentioned in connection with the Northern Steppes, if indeed there
  has not been confusion about them; both are descendants of Juji,
  the eldest son of Chinghiz. One was the twelfth son of Shaibani,
  the 5th son of Juji. Shaibani’s Yurt was in Siberia, and his
  family seem to have become predominant in that quarter. Arghún,
  on his defeat by Ahmad (_supra_ p. 470), was besought to seek
  shelter with Kaunchi. The other Kaunchi was the son of Sirtaktai,
  the son of Orda, the eldest son of Juji, and was, as well as his
  father and grandfather, chief of the White Horde, whose territory
  lay north-east of the Caspian. An embassy from this Kaunchi is
  mentioned as having come to the court of Kaikhátú at Siah-Kuh
  (north of Tabriz) with congratulations, in the summer of 1293. Polo
  may very possibly have seen the members of this embassy, and got
  some of his information from them. (See _Gold. Horde_, 149, 249;
  _Ilkhans_, I. 354, 403; II. 193, where Hammer writes the name of
  _Kandschi_.)

  It is perhaps a trace of the lineage of the old rulers of Siberia
  that the old town of Tyuman in Western Siberia is still known to
  the Tartars as _Chinghiz Tora_, or the Fort of Chinghiz. (_Erman_,
  I. 310.)

  NOTE 2.—We see that Polo’s information in this chapter extends
  over the whole latitude of Siberia; for the great White Bears and
  the Black Foxes belong to the shores of the Frozen Ocean; the Wild
  Asses only to the southern parts of Siberia. As to the Pharaoh’s
  Rat, see vol. i. p. 254.

  NOTE 3.—No dog-sledges are now known, I believe, on this side of
  the course of the Obi, and there not south of about 61° 30′. But
  in the 11th century they were in general use between the Dwina
  and Petchora. And Ibn Batuta’s account seems to imply that in the
  14th they were in use far to the south of the present limit: “It
  had been my wish to visit the Land of Darkness, which can only
  be done from Bolghar. There is a distance of 40 days’ journey
  between these two places. I had to give up the intention however
  on account of the great difficulty attending the journey and the
  little fruit that it promised. In that country they travel only
  with small vehicles drawn by great dogs. For the steppe is covered
  with ice, and the feet of men or the shoes of horses would slip,
  whereas the dogs having claws their paws don’t slip upon the ice.
  The only travellers across this wilderness are rich merchants, each
  of whom owns about 100 of these vehicles, which are loaded with
  meat, drink, and firewood. In fact, on this route there are neither
  trees nor stones, nor human dwellings. The guide of the travellers
  is a dog who has often made the journey before! The price of such
  a beast is sometimes as high as 1000 dinárs or thereabouts. He
  is yoked to the vehicle by the neck, and three other dogs are
  harnessed along with him. He is the chief, and all the other dogs
  with their carts follow his guidance and stop when he stops. The
  master of this animal never ill-uses him nor scolds him, and at
  feeding-time the dogs are always served before the men. If this be
  not attended to, the chief of the dogs will get sulky and run off,
  leaving the master to perdition” (II. 399–400).

    “=E sus ceste treies hi se mete sus un cuir d’ors, e puis hi monte
    sus un mesaje; e ceste treies moinent six chienz de celz grant qe
    je vos ai contés; et cesti chienz ne les moine nulz, mès il vont
    tout droit jusque à l’autre poste, et trainent la treies mout
    bien.=”]

  [Mr. Parker writes (_China Review_, xiv. p. 359), that dog-sledges
  appear to have been known to the Chinese, for in a Chinese poem
  occurs the line: “Over the thick snow in a dog-cart.”—H. C.]

  The bigness attributed to the dogs by Polo, Ibn Batuta, and
  Rubruquis, is an imagination founded on the work ascribed to them.
  Mr. Kennan says they are simply half-domesticated Arctic wolves.
  Erman calls them the height of European spaniels (qu. setters?),
  but much slenderer and leaner in the flanks. A good draught-dog,
  according to Wrangell, should be 2 feet high and 3 feet in length.
  The number of dogs attached to a sledge is usually greater than the
  old travellers represent,—none of whom, however, had _seen_ the
  thing.

  Wrangell’s account curiously illustrates what Ibn Batuta says of
  the Old Dog who guides: “The best-trained and most intelligent
  dog is often yoked in front.... He often displays extraordinary
  sagacity and influence over the other dogs, _e.g._ in keeping them
  from breaking after game. In such a case he will sometimes turn
  and bark in the opposite direction; ... and in crossing a naked
  and boundless _taundra_ in darkness or snow-drift he will guess
  his way to a hut that he has never visited but once before” (I.
  159). Kennan also says: “They are guided and controlled entirely
  by the voice and by a lead-dog, who is especially trained for the
  purpose.” The like is related of the Esquimaux dogs. (_Kennan’s
  Tent Life in Siberia_, pp. 163–164; _Wood’s Mammalia_, p. 266.)

  NOTE 4.—On the _Erculin_ and _Ercolin_ of the G. T., written
  Arculin in next chapter, _Arcolino_ of Ramusio, _Herculini_ of
  Pipino, no light is thrown by the Italian or other editors. One
  supposes of course some animal of the ermine or squirrel kinds
  affording valuable fur, but I can find no similar name of any
  such animal. It may be the Argali or Siberian Wild Sheep, which
  Rubruquis mentions: “I saw another kind of beast which is called
  _Arcali_; its body is just like a ram’s, and its horns spiral like
  a ram’s also, only they are so big that I could scarcely lift a
  pair of them with one hand. They make huge drinking-vessels out of
  these” (p. 230). [See I. p. 177.]

  _Vair_, so often mentioned in mediæval works, appears to have
  been a name appropriate to the fur as prepared rather than to the
  animal. This appears to have been the Siberian squirrel called in
  French _petit-gris_, the back of which is of a fine grey and the
  belly of a brilliant white. In the _Vair_ (which is perhaps only
  _varius_ or variegated) the backs and bellies were joined in a kind
  of checquer; whence the heraldic checquer called by the same name.
  There were two kinds, _menu-vair_ corrupted into _minever_, and
  _gros-vair_, but I cannot learn clearly on what the distinction
  rested. (See _Douet d’Arcq_, p. xxxv.) Upwards of 2000 _ventres de
  menuvair_ were sometimes consumed in one complete suit of robes
  (_ib._ xxxii.).

  The traps used by the Siberian tribes to take these valuable
  animals are described by Erman (I. 452), only in the English
  translation the description is totally incomprehensible; also in
  Wrangell, I. 151.

  NOTE 5.—The country chiefly described in this chapter is probably
  that which the Russians, and also the Arabian Geographers, used to
  term _Yugria_, apparently the country of the Ostyaks on the Obi.
  The winter-dwellings of the people are not, strictly speaking,
  underground, but they are flanked with earth piled up against the
  walls. The same is the case with those of the Yakuts in Eastern
  Siberia, and these often have the floors also sunk 3 feet in the
  earth. Habitations really subterranean, of some previous race, have
  been found in the Samoyed country. (_Klaproth’s Mag. Asiatique, II.
  66._)




                             CHAPTER XXI.

                   CONCERNING THE LAND OF DARKNESS.


Still further north, and a long way beyond that kingdom of which I have
spoken, there is a region which bears the name of DARKNESS, because
neither sun nor moon nor stars appear, but it is always as dark as
with us in the twilight. The people have no king of their own, nor are
they subject to any foreigner, and live like beasts. [They are dull of
understanding, like half-witted persons.{1}]

The Tartars however sometimes visit the country, and they do it in this
way. They enter the region riding mares that have foals, and these
foals they leave behind. After taking all the plunder that they can get
they find their way back by help of the mares, which are all eager to
get back to their foals, and find the way much better than their riders
could do.{2}

Those people have vast quantities of valuable peltry; thus they have
those costly Sables of which I spoke, and they have the Ermine, the
Arculin, the Vair, the Black Fox, and many other valuable furs. They
are all hunters by trade, and amass amazing quantities of those furs.
And the people who are on their borders, where the Light is, purchase
all those furs from them; for the people of the Land of Darkness carry
the furs to the Light country for sale, and the merchants who purchase
these make great gain thereby, I assure you.{3}

The people of this region are tall and shapely, but very pale and
colourless. One end of the country borders upon Great Rosia. And as
there is no more to be said about it, I will now proceed, and first I
will tell you about the Province of Rosia.


  NOTE 1.—In the Ramusian version we have a more intelligent
  representation of the facts regarding the _Land of Darkness_:
  “Because for most part of the winter months the sun appears not,
  and the air is dusky, as it is just before the dawn when you see
  and yet do not see;” and again below it speaks of the inhabitants
  catching the fur animals “in summer when they have continuous
  daylight.” It is evident that the writer of this version _did_
  and the writer of the original French which we have translated
  from _did not_ understand what he was writing. The whole of the
  latter account implies belief in the perpetuity of the darkness.
  It resembles Pliny’s hazy notion of the northern regions:[1] “pars
  mundi damnata a rerum naturâ et densâ mersa caligine.” Whether the
  fault is due to Rustician’s ignorance or is Polo’s own, who can
  say? We are willing to debit it to the former, and to credit Marco
  with the improved version in Ramusio. In the _Masálak-al-Absár_,
  however, we have the following passage in which the conception is
  similar: “Merchants do not ascend (the Wolga) beyond Bolghar; from
  that point they make excursions through the province of Julman
  (supposed to be the country on the Kama and Viatka). The merchants
  of the latter country penetrate to Yughra, which is the extremity
  of the North. Beyond that you see no trace of habitation except
  a great Tower built by Alexander, after which there is nothing
  but Darkness.” The narrator of this, being asked what he meant,
  said: “It is a region of desert mountains, where frost and snow
  continually reign, where the sun never shines, no plant vegetates,
  and no animal lives. Those mountains border on the Dark Sea, on
  which rain falls perpetually, fogs are ever dense, and the sun
  never shows itself, and on tracts perpetually covered with snow.”
  (_N. et Ex._ XIII. i. 285.)

  NOTE 2.—This is probably a story of great antiquity, for it occurs
  in the legends of the mythical _Ughuz_, Patriarch of the Turk and
  Tartar nations, as given by Rashiduddin. In this hero’s campaign
  towards the far north, he had ordered the old men to be left behind
  near Almalik; but a very ancient sage called Bushi Khwaja persuaded
  his son to carry him forward in a box, as they were sure sooner or
  later to need the counsel of experienced age. When they got to the
  land of _Kará Hulun_, Ughuz and his officers were much perplexed
  about finding their way, as they had arrived at the Land of
  Darkness. The old Bushi was then consulted, and his advice was that
  they should take with them 4 mares and 9 she-asses that had foals,
  and tie up the foals at the entrance to the Land of Darkness, but
  drive the dams before them. And when they wished to return they
  would be guided by the scent and maternal instinct of the mares and
  she-asses. And so it was done. (See _Erdmann Temudschin_, p. 478.)
  Ughuz, according to the Mussulman interpretation of the Eastern
  Legends, was the great-grandson of Japhet.

  The story also found its way into some of the later Greek forms
  of the Alexander Legends. Alexander, when about to enter the Land
  of Darkness, takes with him only picked young men. Getting into
  difficulties, the King wants to send back for some old sage who
  should advise. Two young men had smuggled their old father with
  them in anticipation of such need, and on promise of amnesty they
  produce him. He gives the advice to use the mares as in the text.
  (See _Müller’s ed._ of _Pseudo-Callisthenes_, Bk. II. ch. xxxiv.)

  NOTE 3.—Ibn Batuta thus describes the traffic that took place with
  the natives of the Land of Darkness: “When the Travellers have
  accomplished a journey of 40 days across this Desert tract they
  encamp near the borders of the Land of Darkness. Each of them then
  deposits there the goods that he has brought with him, and all
  return to their quarters. On the morrow they come back to look at
  their goods, and find laid beside them skins of the Sable, the
  Vair, and the Ermine. If the owner of the goods is satisfied with
  what is laid beside his parcel he takes it, if not he leaves it
  there. The inhabitants of the Land of Darkness may then (on another
  visit) increase the amount of their deposit, or, as often happens,
  they may take it away altogether and leave the goods of the foreign
  merchants untouched. In this way is the trade conducted. The people
  who go thither never know whether those with whom they buy and sell
  are men or goblins, for they never see any one!” (II. 401.)

  [“Ibn Batuta’s account of the market of the ‘Land of Darkness’ ...
  agrees almost word for word with Dr. Mirth’s account of the ‘Spirit
  Market, taken from the Chinese.’” (_Parker, China Review_, XIV. p.
  359.)—H. C.]

  Abulfeda gives exactly the same account of the trade; and so
  does Herberstein. Other Oriental writers ascribe the same custom
  to the _Wisu_, a people three months’ journey from Bolghar.
  These Wisu have been identified by Fraehn with the _Wesses_, a
  people spoken of by Russian historians as dwelling on the shores
  of the Bielo Osero, which Lake indeed is alleged by a Russian
  author to have been anciently called _Wüsu_, misunderstood into
  _Weissensee_, and thence rendered into Russian Bielo Osero (“White
  Lake”). (_Golden Horde_, App. p. 429; _Büsching_, IV. 359–360;
  _Herberstein_ in _Ram._ II. 168 v.; _Fraehn, Bolghar_, pp. 14,
  47; Do., _Ibn Fozlan_, 205 _seqq._, 221.) Dumb trade of the same
  kind is a circumstance related of very many different races and
  periods, _e.g._, of a people beyond the Pillars of Hercules by
  Herodotus, of the Sabaean dealers in frankincense by Theophrastus,
  of the Seres by Pliny, of the Sasians far south of Ethiopia by
  Cosmas, of the people of the Clove Islands by Kazwini, of a region
  beyond Segelmessa by Mas’udi, of a people far beyond Timbuctoo
  by Cadamosto, of the Veddas of Ceylon by Marignolli and more modern
  writers, of the Poliars of Malabar by various authors, by Paulus
  Jovius of the Laplanders, etc. etc.

  Pliny’s attribution, surely erroneous, of this custom to the
  Chinese [see _supra_, H. C.], suggests that there may have been a
  misunderstanding by which this method of trade was confused with
  that other curious system of dumb higgling, by the pressure of the
  knuckles under a shawl, a masonic system in use from Peking to
  Bombay, and possibly to Constantinople.

  The term translated here “Light,” and the “Light Country,” is in
  the G. T. “_a la Carte_,” “_a la Cartes_.” This puzzled me for a
  long time, as I see it puzzled Mr. Hugh Murray, Signor Bartoli, and
  Lazari (who passes it over). The version of Pipino, “_ad_ Lucis
  _terras finitimas deferunt_,” points to the true reading;—_Carte_
  is an error for _Clarté_.

  The reading of this chapter is said to have fired Prince Rupert
  with the scheme which resulted in the establishment of the Hudson’s
  Bay Company.

                             CHAPTER XXII.

         DESCRIPTION OF ROSIA AND ITS PEOPLE. PROVINCE OF LAC.


Rosia is a very great province, lying towards the north. The people are
Christians, and follow the Greek doctrine. There are several kings in
the country, and they have a language of their own. They are a people
of simple manners, but both men and women very handsome, being all very
white and [tall, with long fair hair]. There are many strong defiles
and passes in the country; and they pay tribute to nobody except to a
certain Tartar king of the Ponent, whose name is TOCTAI; to him indeed
they pay tribute, but only a trifle. It is not a land of trade, though
to be sure they have many fine and valuable furs, such as Sables,
in abundance, and Ermine, Vair, Ercolin, and Fox skins, the largest
and finest in the world [and also much wax]. They also possess many
Silver-mines, from which they derive a large amount of silver.{1}

There is nothing else worth mentioning; so let us leave Rosia,
and I will tell you about the Great Sea, and what provinces and
nations lie round about it, all in detail; and we will begin with
Constantinople.—First, however, I should tell you of a province that
lies between north and north-west. You see in that region that I have
been speaking of, there is a province called LAC, which is conterminous
with Rosia, and has a king of its own. The people are partly Christians
and partly Saracens. They have abundance of furs of good quality,
which merchants export to many countries. They live by trade and
handicrafts.{2}

There is nothing more worth mentioning, so I will speak of other
subjects; but there is one thing more to tell you about Rosia that I
had forgotten. You see in Rosia there is the greatest cold that is to
be found anywhere, so great as to be scarcely bearable. The country
is so great that it reaches even to the shores of the Ocean Sea, and
’tis in that sea that there are certain islands in which are produced
numbers of gerfalcons and peregrine falcons, which are carried in many
directions. From Russia also to OROECH it is not very far, and the
journey could be soon made, were it not for the tremendous cold; but
this renders its accomplishment almost impossible.{3}

Now then let us speak of the Great Sea, as I was about to do. To be
sure many merchants and others have been there, but still there are
many again who know nothing about it, so it will be well to include it
in our Book. We will do so then, and let us begin first with the Strait
of Constantinople.


  NOTE 1.—Ibn Fozlan, the oldest Arabic author who gives any detailed
  account of the Russians (and a very remarkable one it is), says
  he “never saw people of form more perfectly developed; they were
  tall as palm-trees, and ruddy of countenance,” but at the same
  time “the most uncleanly people that God hath created,” drunken,
  and frightfully gross in their manners. (_Fraehn’s Ibn Fozlan_,
  p. 5 _seqq._) Ibn Batuta is in some respects less flattering; he
  mentions the silver-mines noticed in our text: “At a day’s distance
  from Ukak[1] are the hills of the Russians, who are Christians.
  They have red hair and blue eyes; ugly to look at, and crafty to
  deal with. They have silver-mines, and it is from their country
  that are brought the _saum_ or ingots of silver with which buying
  and selling is carried on in this country (Kipchak or the Ponent of
  Polo). The weight of each _saumah_ is 5 ounces” (II. 414). Mas’udi
  also says: “The Russians have in their country a silver-mine
  similar to that which exists in Khorasan, at the mountain of
  Banjhir” (_i.e._ _Panjshir_; II. 15; and see _supra_, vol. I. p.
  161). These positive and concurrent testimonies as to Russian
  silver-mines are remarkable, as modern accounts declare that no
  silver is found in Russia. And if we go back to the 16th century,
  Herberstein says the same. There was no silver, he says, except
  what was imported; silver money had been in use barely 100 years;
  previously they had used oblong ingots of the value of a ruble,
  without any figure or legend. (_Ram._ II. 159.)

  But a welcome communication from Professor Bruun points out that
  the statement of Ibn Batuta identifies the silver-mines in question
  with certain mines of argentiferous lead-ore near the River Mious
  (a river falling into the sea of Azof, about 22 miles west of
  Taganrog); an ore which even in recent times has afforded 60 per
  cent. of lead, and ¹⁄₂₄ per cent. of silver. And it was these
  mines which furnished the ancient Russian _rubles_ or ingots. Thus
  the original _ruble_ was the _saumah_ of Ibn Batuta, the _sommo_
  of Pegolotti. A ruble seems to be still called by some term like
  _saumah_ in Central Asia; it is printed _soom_ in the Appendix to
  Davies’s Punjab Report, p. xi. And Professor Bruun tells me that
  the silver ruble is called _Som_ by the Ossethi of Caucasus.[2]

  Franc.-Michel quotes from Fitz-Stephen’s Desc. of London (_temp._
  Henry II.):—

      “_Aurum mittit Arabs_ ...
       _Seres purpureas vestes; Galli sua vina;_
       _Norwegi_, Russi, varium, grysium, sabelinas.”

  Russia was overrun with fire and sword as far as Tver and Torshok
  by Batu Khan (1237–1238), some years before his invasion of Poland
  and Silesia. Tartar tax-gatherers were established in the Russian
  cities as far north as Rostov and Jaroslawl, and for many years
  Russian princes as far as Novgorod paid homage to the Mongol Khans
  in their court at Sarai. Their subjection to the Khans was not
  such a trifle as Polo seems to imply; and at least a dozen Russian
  princes met their death at the hands of the Mongol executioner.

  NOTE 2.—The _Lac_ of this passage appears to be WALLACHIA. Abulfeda
  calls the Wallachs _Aulák_; Rubruquis _Illac_, which he says is the
  same word as _Blac_ (the usual European form of those days being
  _Blachi, Blachia_), but the Tartars could not pronounce the B (p.
  275). Abulghazi says the original inhabitants of Kipchak were the
  _Urús_, the Olaks, _the Majars_, and the _Bashkirs_.

  Rubruquis is wrong in placing _Illac_ or Wallachs in Asia; at
  least the people near the Ural, who he says were so-called by the
  Tartars, cannot have been Wallachs. Professor Bruun, who corrects
  my error in following Rubruquis, thinks those Asiatic _Blac_ must
  have been _Polovtzi_, or Cumanians.

  [Mr. Rockhill (_Rubruck_, p. 130, note) writes: “A branch of the
  Volga Bulgars occupied the Moldo-Vallach country in about A.D. 485,
  but it was not until the first years of the 6th century that a
  portion of them passed the Danube under the leadership of Asparuk,
  and established themselves in the present Bulgaria, Friar William’s
  ‘Land of Assan.’”—H. C.]

  NOTE 3.—_Oroech_ is generally supposed to be a mistake for
  _Noroech_, NORWEGE or Norway, which is probable enough. But
  considering the Asiatic sources of most of our author’s
  information, it is also possible that _Oroech_ represents WAREG.
  The _Waraegs_ or _Warangs_ are celebrated in the oldest Russian
  history as a race of warlike immigrants, of whom came Rurik, the
  founder of the ancient royal dynasty, and whose name was long
  preserved in that of the Varangian guards at Constantinople. Many
  Eastern geographers, from Al Biruni downwards, speak of the Warag
  or Warang as a nation dwelling in the north, on the borders of
  the Slavonic countries, and on the shores of a great arm of the
  Western Ocean, called the _Sea of Warang_, evidently the Baltic.
  The Waraegers are generally considered to have been Danes or
  Northmen, and Erman mentions that in the bazaars of Tobolsk he
  found Danish goods known as _Varaegian_. Mr. Hyde Clark, as I learn
  from a review, has recently identified the Warangs or Warings with
  the _Varini_, whom Tacitus couples with the Angli, and has shown
  probable evidence for their having taken part in the invasion of
  Britain. He has also shown that many points of the laws which they
  established in Russia were purely Saxon in character. (_Bayer_ in
  _Comment. Acad. Petropol._ IV. 276 _seqq._; _Fraehn_ in App. to
  _Ibn Fozlan_, p. 177 _seqq._; _Erman_, I. 374; _Sat. Review_, 19th
  June, 1869; _Gold. Horde_, App. p. 428.)

[1] This Ukak of Ibn Batuta is not, as I too hastily supposed (vol.
    i. p. 8) the _Ucaca_ of the Polos on the Volga, but a place of
    the same name on the Sea of Azof, which appears in some mediæval
    maps as _Locac_ or _Locaq_ (_i.e._ _l’Ocac_), and which Elie de

       HE BEGINS TO SPEAK OF THE STRAITS OF CONSTANTINOPLE, BUT
                     DECIDES TO LEAVE THAT MATTER.


At the straits leading into the Great Sea, on the west side, there is a
hill called the FARO.—But since beginning on this matter I have changed
my mind, because so many people know all about it, so we will not put
it in our description, but go on to something else. And so I will tell
you about the Tartars of the Ponent, and the lords who have reigned
over them.




                             CHAPTER XXIV.

         CONCERNING THE TARTARS OF THE PONENT AND THEIR LORDS.


The first lord of the Tartars of the Ponent was SAIN, a very great and
puissant king, who conquered ROSIA and COMANIA, ALANIA, LAC, MENJAR,
ZIC, GOTHIA, and GAZARIA; all these provinces were conquered by King
Sain. Before his conquest these all belonged to the Comanians, but
they did not hold well together nor were they united, and thus they
lost their territories and were dispersed over divers countries; and
those who remained all became the servants of King Sain.{1}

After King Sain reigned King PATU, and after Patu BARCA, and after
Barca MUNGLETEMUR, and after Mungletemur King TOTAMANGUL, and then
TOCTAI the present sovereign.{2}

Now I have told you of the Tartar kings of the Ponent, and next I shall
tell you of a great battle that was fought between Alau the Lord of the
Levant and Barca the Lord of the Ponent.

So now we will relate out of what occasion that battle arose, and how
it was fought.


  NOTE 1.—✛The COMANIANS, a people of Turkish race, the _Polovtzi_ [or
  “Dwellers of the Plain” of Nestor, the Russian Annalist] of the old
  Russians, were one of the chief nations occupying the plains on
  the north of the Black Sea and eastward to the Caspian, previous
  to the Mongol invasion. Rubruquis makes them identical with the
  KIPCHAK, whose name is generally attached to those plains by
  Oriental writers, but Hammer disputes this. [See a note, pp. 92–93
  of _Rockhill’s Rubruck_.—H. C.]

  ALANIA, the country of the Alans on the northern skirts of the
  Caucasus and towards the Caspian; LAC, the Wallachs as above.
  MENJAR is a subject of doubt. It may be _Májar_, on the Kuma
  River, a city which was visited by Ibn Batuta, and is mentioned by
  Abulfeda as _Kummájar_. It was in the 14th century the seat of a
  Franciscan convent. Coins of that century, both of Majar and New
  Majar, are given by Erdmann. The building of the fortresses of
  Kichi Majar and Ulu Majar (little and great) is ascribed in the
  _Derbend Nameh_ to Naoshirwan. The ruins of Majar were extensive
  when seen by Gmelin in the last century, but when visited by
  Klaproth in the early part of the present one there were few
  buildings remaining. Inscriptions found there are, like the coins,
  Mongol-Mahomedan of the 14th century. Klaproth, with reference to
  these ruins, says that _Majar_ merely means in “old Tartar” a stone
  building, and denies any connection with the _Magyars_ as a nation.
  But it is possible that the Magyar country, _i.e._ Hungary, is here
  intended by Polo, for several Asiatic writers of his time, or near
  it, speak of the Hungarians as _Majár_. Thus Abulfeda speaks of the
  infidel nations near the Danube as including Aulák, Majárs, and
  Serbs; Rashiduddin speaks of the Mongols as conquering the country
  of the Bashkirds, the Majárs, and the Sassan (probably Saxons of
  Transylvania). One such mention from Abulghazi has been quoted in
  note 2 to ch. xxii.; in the _Masálak-al-Absár_, the _Cherkes_,
  _Russians_, _Aas_ (or Alans), and Majar are associated; the Majar
  _and Alán_ in Sharifuddin. Doubts indeed arise whether in some
  of these instances a people located in Asia be not intended.[1]

  [“The author of the _Tarikh Djihan Kushai_, as well as Rashid and
  other Mohammedan authors of the same period, term the Hungarians
  _Bashkerds_ (Bashkirs). This latter name, written also _Bashkurd_,
  appears for the first time, it seems, in Ibn Fozlan’s narrative
  of an embassy to the Bulgars on the Volga in the beginning of the
  10th century (translated by Fraehn, ‘De Bashkiris,’ etc., 1822)....
  The Hungarians arrived in Europe in the 9th century, and then
  called themselves _Magyar_ (to be pronounced Modjor), as they do
  down to the present time. The Russian Chronicler Nestor mentions
  their passing near Kiev in 898, and terms them _Ugry_. But the
  name Magyar was also known to other nations in the Middle Ages.
  Abulfeda (ii. 324) notices the _Madjgars_; it would, however,
  seem that he applies this name to the Bashkirs in Asia. The name
  _Madjar_ occurs also in Rashid’s record. In the Chinese and Mongol
  annals of the 13th century the Hungarians are termed _Madja-rh_.”

  ZIC is Circassia. The name was known to Pliny, Ptolemy, and other
  writers of classic times. Ramusio (II. 196 _v_) gives a curious
  letter to Aldus Manutius from George Interiano, “_Della vita de’_
  Zychi _chiamati Circassi_,” and a great number of other references
  to ancient and mediæval use of the name will be found in D’Avezac’s
  Essay, so often quoted (p. 497).

  GOTHIA is the southern coast of the Crimea from Sudak to Balaklava
  and the mountains north of the latter, then still occupied by a
  tribe of the Goths. The Genoese officer who governed this coast
  in the 15th century bore the title of _Capitanus Gotiae_; and a
  remnant of the tribe still survived, maintaining their Teutonic
  speech, to the middle of the 16th century, when Busbeck, the
  emperor’s ambassador to the Porte, fell in with two of them,
  from whom he derived a small vocabulary and other particulars.

  GAZARIA, the Crimea and part of the northern shore of the Sea of
  Azov, formerly occupied by the _Khazars_, a people whom Klaproth
  endeavours to prove to have been of Finnish race. When the Genoese
  held their settlements on the Crimean coast the Board at Genoa
  which administered the affairs of these colonies was called _The
  Office of Gazaria_.

  NOTE 2.—The real list of the “Kings of the Ponent,” or Khans of
  the Golden Horde, down to the time of Polo’s narrative, runs thus:
  BATU, _Sartaḳ, Ulagchi_ (these two almost nominal), BARKA, MANGKU
  TIMUR, TUDAI MANGKU, _Tulabugha_, _Tuktuka_ or TOKTAI. Polo here
  omits Tulabugha (though he mentions him below in ch. xxix.), and
  introduces before Batu, as a great and powerful conqueror, the
  founder of the empire, a prince whom he calls _Sain_. This is in
  fact Batu himself, the leader of the great Tartar invasion of
  Europe (1240–1242), whom he has split into two kings. Batu bore
  the surname of _Sain Khan_, or “the _Good_ Prince,” by which name
  he is mentioned, _e.g._, in Makrizi (_Quatremère’s Trans._ II.
  45), also in Wassáf (_Hammer’s Trans._ pp. 29–30). Plano Carpini’s
  account of him is worth quoting: “Hominibus quidem ejus satis
  benignus; timetur tamen valde ab iis; sed crudelissimus est in
  pugnâ; sagax est multum; et etiam astutissimus in bello, quia longo
  tempore jam pugnavit.” This Good Prince was indeed _crudelissimus
  in pugnâ_. At Moscow he ordered a general massacre, and 270,000
  right ears are said to have been laid before him in testimony to
  its accomplishment. It is odd enough that a mistake like that in
  the text is not confined to Polo. The chronicle of Kazan, according
  to a Russian writer, makes _Sain_ succeed _Batu_. (_Carpini_, p.
  746; _J. As._ sér. IV. tom. xvii. p. 109; _Büsching_, V. 493; also
  _Golden Horde_, p. 142, note.)

  Batu himself, in the great invasion of the West, was with the
  southern host in Hungary; the northern army which fought at
  Liegnitz was under Baidar, a son of Chaghatai.

  According to the _Masálak-al-Absár_, the territory of Kipchak,
  over which this dynasty ruled, extended in length from the Sea
  of Istambul to the River Irtish, a journey of 6 months, and in
  breadth from Bolghar to the Iron Gates, 4 (?) months’ journey. A
  second traveller, quoted in the same work, says the empire extended
  from the Iron Gates to _Yughra_ (see p. 483 _supra_), and from
  the Irtish to the country of the _Nemej_. The last term is very
  curious, being the Russian _Niemicz_, “Dumb,” a term which in
  Russia is used as a proper name of the Germans; a people, to wit,
  unable to speak Slavonic. (_N. et Ex._ XIII. i. 282, 284.)

  [“An allusion to the Mongol invasion of Poland and Silesia is
  found in the _Yuen-shi_, ch. cxxi., biography of Wu-liang-ho t’ai
  (the son of Su-bu-t’ai). It is stated there that Wu-liang-ho t’ai
  [Uriangcadai] accompanied Badu when he invaded the countries of
  _Kin-ch’a_ (Kipchak) and _Wu-la-sz’_ (Russia). Subsequently he
  took part also in the expedition against the _P’o-lie-rh_ and
  _Nie-mi-sze_.” (_Dr. Bretschneider, Med. Res._ I. p. 322.) With
  reference to these two names, Dr. Bretschneider says, in a note,
  that he has no doubt that the Poles and Germans are intended. “As
  to its origin, the Russian linguists generally derive it from
  _nemoi_, ‘dumb,’ _i.e._, unable to speak Slavonic. To the ancient
  Byzantine chroniclers the Germans were known under the same name.
  Cf. _Muralt’s Essai de Chronogr. Byzant., sub anno_ 882: ‘Les
  Slavons maltraités par les guerriers _Nemetzi_ de Swiatopolc’ (King
  of Great Moravia, 870–894). Sophocles’ Greek Lexicon of the Roman
  and Byzantine periods from B.C. 146 to A.D. 1100: ‘_Nemitzi_’
  Austrians, Germans. This name is met also in the Mohammedan
  authors. According to the Masálak-al-Absár, of the first half of
  the 14th century (transl. by Quatremère, _N. et Ext._ XXII. 284),
  the country of the Kipchaks extended (eastward) to the country of
  the _Nemedj_, which separates the Franks from the Russians. The
  Turks still call the Germans _Niemesi_; the Hungarians term them
  _Nemet_.”—H. C.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] This doubt arises also where Abulfeda speaks of _Majgaria_ in the
    far north, “the capital of the country of the _Madjgars_, a Turk
    race” of pagan nomads, by whom he seems to mean the _Bashkirs_.
    (_Reinaud’s Abulf._ I. 324.) For it is to the Bashkir country
    that the Franciscan travellers apply the term Great Hungary,
    showing that they were led to believe it the original seat of the
    _Magyars_. (_Rubr._ 274, _Plan. Carpin._ 747; and in same vol.,
    _D’Avezac_, p. 491.) Further confusion arises from the fact that,
    besides the Uralian Bashkirs, there were, down to the 13th century,
    Bashkirs recognised as such, and as distinct from the Hungarians
    though akin to them, dwelling in _Hungarian territory_. Ibn Said,
    speaking of Sebennico (the cradle of the Polo family), says that
    when the Tartars advanced under its walls (1242?) “the Hungarians,
    the Bashkirs, and the Germans united their forces near the city”
    and gave the invaders a signal defeat. (_Reinaud’s Abulf._ I. 312;
    see also 294, 295.) One would gladly know what are the real names
    that M. Reinaud renders _Hongrois_ and _Allemands_. The Christian
    Bashkirds of Khondemir, on the borders of the Franks, appear to be
    Hungarians. (See _J. As._, sér. IV. tom. xvii. p. 111.)




                             CHAPTER XXV.

     OF THE WAR THAT AROSE BETWEEN ALAU AND BARCA, AND THE BATTLES
                           THAT THEY FOUGHT.


It was in the year 1261 of Christ’s incarnation that there arose a
great discord between King Alau the Lord of the Tartars of the Levant,
and Barca the King of the Tartars of the Ponent; the occasion whereof
was a province that lay on the confines of both.{1}

⚜ (They exchange defiances, and make vast preparations.)

And when his preparations were complete, Alau the Lord of Levant set
forth with all his people. They marched for many days without any
adventure to speak of, and at last they reached a great plain which
extends between the IRON GATES and the SEA OF SARAIN.{2} In this plain
he pitched his camp in beautiful order; and I can assure you there was
many a rich tent and pavilion therein, so that it looked indeed like
a camp of the wealthy. Alau said he would tarry there to see if Barca
and his people would come; so there they tarried, abiding the enemy’s
arrival. This place where the camp was pitched was on the frontier of
the two kings. Now let us speak of Barca and his people.{3}


  NOTE 1.—“_Que_ marcesoit _à le un et à le autre_;” in Scotch
  phrase, “which _marched_ with both.”

  NOTE 2.—Respecting the Iron Gates, see vol. i. p. 53. The Caspian
  is here called the Sea of _Sarain_, probably for _Sarai_, after the
  great city on the Volga. For we find it in the Catalan Map of 1375
  termed the Sea of _Sarra_. Otherwise _Sarain_ might have been taken
  for some corruption of _Shirwán_. (See vol. i. p. 59, note 8.)

  NOTE 3.—The war here spoken of is the same which is mentioned in
  the very beginning of the book, as having compelled the two Elder
  Polos to travel much further eastward than they had contemplated.

  Many jealousies and heart-burnings between the cousins Hulaku and
  Barka had existed for several years. The Mameluke Sultan Bibars
  seems also to have stimulated Barka to hostility with Hulaku. War
  broke out in 1262, when 30,000 men from Kipchak, under the command
  of Nogai, passed Derbend into the province of Shirwan. They were
  at first successful, but afterwards defeated. In December, Hulaku,
  at the head of a great army, passed Derbend, and routed the forces
  which met him. Ábáká, son of Hulaku, was sent on with a large
  force, and came upon the opulent camp of Barka beyond the Terek.
  They were revelling in its plunder, when Barka rallied his troops
  and came upon the army of Ábáká, driving them southward again,
  across the frozen river. The ice broke and many perished. Ábáká
  escaped, chased by Barka to Derbend. Hulaku returned to Tabriz and
  made great preparations for vengeance, but matters were apparently
  never carried further. Hence Polo’s is anything but an accurate
  account of the matter.

  The following extract from Wassáf’s History, referring to this war,
  is a fine sample of that prince of rigmarole:

  “In the winter of 662 (A.D. 1262–1263) when the Almighty Artist had
  covered the River of Derbend with plates of silver, and the Furrier
  of the Winter had clad the hills and heaths in ermine; the river
  being frozen hard as a rock to the depth of a spear’s length, an
  army of Mongols went forth at the command of Barka Aghul, filthy as
  Ghúls and Devils of the dry-places, and in numbers countless as the
  rain-drops,” etc. etc. (_Golden Horde_, p. 163 _seqq._; _Ilchan._

             HOW BARCA AND HIS ARMY ADVANCED TO MEET ALAU.


⚜ (Barca advances with 350,000 horse, encamps on the plain within 10

         HOW TOTAMANGU WAS LORD OF THE TARTARS OF THE PONENT.


You must know there was a Prince of the Tartars of the Ponent called
MONGOTEMUR, and from him the sovereignty passed to a young gentleman
called TOLOBUGA. But TOTAMANGU, who was a man of great influence, with
the help of another Tartar King called NOGAI, slew Tolobuga and got
possession of the sovereignty. He reigned not long however, and at his
death TOCTAI, an able and valiant man, was chosen sovereign in the
place of Totamangu. But in the meantime two sons of that Tolobuga who
was slain were grown up, and were likely youths, able and prudent.

So these two brothers, the sons of Totamangu, got together a goodly
company and proceeded to the court of Toctai. When they had got
thither they conducted themselves with great discretion, keeping on
their knees till Toctai bade them welcome, and to stand up. Then the
eldest addressed the Sovereign thus: “Good my Lord Toctai, I will tell
you to the best of my ability why we be come hither. We are the sons
of Totamangu, whom Tolobuga and Nogai slew, as thou well knowest.
Of Tolobuga we will say no more, since he is dead, but we demand
justice against Nogai as the slayer of our Father; and we pray thee as
Sovereign Lord to summon him before thee and to do us justice. For this
cause are we come!”{1}

(Toctai agrees to their demand and sends two messengers to summon
Nogai, but Nogai mocks at the message and refuses to go. Whereupon
Toctai sends a second couple of messengers.)


  NOTE 1.—I have not attempted to correct the obvious confusion here;
  for in comparing the story related here with the regular historians
  we find the knots too complicated for solution.

  In the text as it stands we first learn that Totamangu by help of
  Nogai kills _Tolobuga_, takes the throne, dies, and is succeeded by
  Toctai. But presently we find that it is the sons of _Totamangu_
  who claim vengeance from Toctai against Nogai for having aided
  Tolobuga to slay their father. Turning back to the list of princes
  in chapter xxiv. we find Totamangu indeed, but Tolobuga omitted
  altogether.

  The outline of the history as gathered from Hammer and D’Ohsson is
  as follows:—

  NOGHAI, for more than half a century one of the most influential of
  the Mongol Princes, was a great-great-grandson of Chinghiz, being
  the son of Tatar, son of Tewal, son of Juji. He is first heard of
  as a leader under Batu Khan in the great invasion of Europe (1241),
  and again in 1258 we find him leading an invasion of Poland.

  In the latter quarter of the century he had established himself
  as practically independent, in the south of Russia. There is
  much about him in the Byzantine history of Pachymeres; Michael
  Palaeologus sought his alliance against the Bulgarians (of the
  south), and gave him his illegitimate daughter Euphrosyne to wife.
  Some years later Noghai gave a daughter of his own in marriage to
  Feodor Rostislawitz, Prince of Smolensk.

  Mangu- or Mangku-Temur, the great-nephew and successor of Barka,
  died in 1280–81 leaving nine sons, but was succeeded by his brother
  TUDAI-MANGKU (Polo’s _Totamangu_). This Prince occupied himself
  chiefly with the company of Mahomedan theologians and was averse to
  the cares of government. In 1287 he abdicated, and was replaced by
  TULABUGHA (_Tolobuga_), the son of an elder brother, whose power,
  however, was shared by other princes. Tulabugha quarrelled with old
  Noghai and was preparing to attack him. Noghai however persuaded
  him to come to an interview, and at this Tulabugha was put to
  death. TOKTAI, one of the sons of Mangku-Temur, who was associated
  with Noghai, obtained the throne of Kipchak. This was in 1291. We
  hear nothing of sons of Tudai-Mangku or Tulabugha.

  Some years later we hear of a symbolic declaration of war sent by
  Toktai to Noghai, and then of a great battle between them near the
  banks of the Don, in which Toktai is defeated. Later, they are
  again at war, and somewhere south of the Dnieper Noghai is beaten.
  As he was escaping with a few mounted followers, he was cut down by
  a Russian horseman. “I am Noghai,” said the old warrior, “take me
  to Toktai.” The Russian took the bridle to lead him to the camp,
  but by the way the old chief expired. The horseman carried his head
  to the Khan; its heavy grey eyebrows, we are told, hung over and
  hid the eyes. Toktai asked the Russian how he knew the head to be
  that of Noghai. “He told me so himself,” said the man. And so he
  was ordered to execution for having presumed to slay a great Prince
  without orders. How like the story of David and the Amalekite in
  Ziklag! (2 Samuel, ch. i.).

  The chronology of these events is doubtful. Rashiduddin seems to
  put the defeat of Toktai near the Don in 1298–1299, and a passage
  in Wassáf extracted by Hammer seems to put the defeat and death of
  Noghai about 1303. On the other hand, there is evidence that war
  between the two was in full flame in the beginning of 1296; Makrizi
  seems to report the news of a great defeat of Toktai by Noghai as
  reaching Cairo in _Jumadah_ I. A.H. 697 or February–March, 1298.
  And Novairi, from whom D’Ohsson gives extracts, appears to put
  the defeat and death of Noghai in 1299. If the battle on the Don
  is that recounted by Marco it cannot be put later than 1297, and
  he must have had news of it at Venice, perhaps from relations at
  Soldaia. I am indeed reluctant to believe that he is not speaking
  of events of which he had cognizance _before_ quitting the East;
  but there is no evidence in favour of that view. (_Golden Horde_,
  especially 269 _seqq._; _Ilchan_. II. 347, and also p. 35;
  _D’Ohsson_, IV. Appendix; _Q. Makrizi_, IV. 60.)

  The symbolical message mentioned above as sent by Toktai to Noghai,
  consisted of a hoe, an arrow, and a handful of earth. Noghai
  interpreted this as meaning, “If you hide in the earth, I will dig
  you out! If you rise to the heavens I will shoot you down! Choose
  a battle-field!” What a singular similarity we have here to the
  message that reached Darius 1800 years before, on this very ground,
  from Toktai’s predecessors, alien from him in blood it may be, but
  identical in customs and mental characteristics:—

  “At last Darius was in a great strait, and the Kings of the
  Scythians having ascertained this, sent a herald bearing, as gifts
  to Darius, a bird, a mouse, a frog, and five arrows.... Darius’s
  opinion was that the Scythians meant to give themselves up to
  him.... But the opinion of Gobryas, one of the seven who had
  deposed the Magus, did not coincide with this; he conjectured that
  the presents intimated: ‘Unless, O Persians, ye become birds, and
  fly into the air, or become mice and hide yourselves beneath the
  earth, or become frogs and leap into the lakes, ye shall never
  return home again, but be stricken by these arrows.’ And thus the
  other Persians interpreted the gifts.” (_Herodotus_, by Carey,
  IV. 131, 132.) Again, more than 500 years after Noghai and Toktai
  were laid in the steppe, when Muraview reached the court of Khiva
  in 1820, it happened that among the Russian presents offered to
  the Khan were two loaves of sugar on the same tray with a quantity
  of powder and shot. The Uzbegs interpreted this as a symbolical
  demand: Peace or War? (_V. en Turcomanie_, p. 165.)

                            CONCLUSION.[1]


And now ye have heard all that we can tell you about the Tartars and
the Saracens and their customs, and likewise about the other countries
of the world as far as our researches and information extend. Only we
have said nothing whatever about the GREATER SEA and the provinces
that lie round it, although we know it thoroughly. But it seems to me
a needless and useless task to speak about places which are visited by
people every day. For there are so many who sail all about that sea
constantly, Venetians, and Genoese, and Pisans, and many others, that
everybody knows all about it, and that is the reason that I pass it
over and say nothing of it.

Of the manner in which we took our departure from the Court of the
Great Kaan you have heard at the beginning of the Book, in that chapter
where we told you of all the vexation and trouble that Messer Maffeo
and Messer Nicolo and Messer Marco had about getting the Great Kaan’s
leave to go; and in the same chapter is related the lucky chance that
led to our departure. And you may be sure that but for that lucky
chance, we should never have got away in spite of all our trouble, and
never have got back to our country again. But I believe it was God’s
pleasure that we should get back in order that people might learn about
the things that the world contains. For according to what has been
said in the introduction at the beginning of the Book, there never
was a man, be he Christian or Saracen or Tartar or Heathen, who ever
travelled over so much of the world as did that noble and illustrious
citizen of the City of Venice, Messer Marco the son of Messer Nicolo
Polo.

                       APPENDIX B.—_continued_.

                    (II.) THE POLOS OF SAN GEREMIA.


The preceding Table gives the Family of our Traveller as far as I have
seen sound data for tracing it, either upwards or downwards.

I have expressed, in the introductory notices, my doubts about the
Venetian genealogies, which continue the family down to 1418 or 19,
because it seems to me certain that all of them do more or less
confound with our Polos of S. Giovanni Grisostomo, members of the other
Polo Family of S. Geremia. It will help to disentangle the subject if
we put down what is ascertained regarding the S. Geremia family.

To the latter with tolerable certainty belonged the following:—

1302. MARCO Polo of Cannareggio, see vol. i. pp. _64–67_. (The Church
      of S. Geremia stands on the canal called Cannareggio.)

      Already in 1224, we find a Marco Polo of S. Geremia and
      Cannareggio. (See _Liber Plegiorum_, published with _Archivio
      Veneto_, 1872 pp. 32, 36).

1319. (Bianca, widow of GIOVANNI Polo?)[1]

1332. 24th March. Concession, apparently of some privilege in
      connection with the State Lake in San Basilio, to DONATO and
      HERMORAO (= Hermolaus or Almorò) Paulo (Document partially
      illegible).[2]

1333. 23rd October. Will of Marchesina Corner, wife of Marino Gradenigo
      of S. Apollinare, who chooses for her executors “my mother Dona
      Fiordelisa Cornaro, and my uncle (_Barba_) Ser Marco Polo.”[3]
      Another extract apparently of the same will mentions “_mia
      cusina_ MARIA Polo,” and “_mio cusin_ MARCO Polo” three times.[4]

1349. MARINO Polo and Brothers.[5]

1348. About this time died NICOLO Polo of S. Geremia,[6] who seems to
      have been a Member of the Great Council.[7] He had a brother
      MARCO, and this Marco had a daughter AGNESINA. Nicolo also
      leaves a sister BARBARA (a nun), a son GIOVANNINO (apparently
      illegitimate[7]), of age in 1351,[6] a nephew GHERARDO, and a
      niece FILIPPA,[6] Abbess of Sta. Catarina in Mazzorbo.

      The executors of Nicolo are GIOVANNI and DONATO Polo.[6] We have
      not their relationship stated.

      DONATO must have been the richest Polo we hear of, for in the
      Estimo or forced Loan of 1379 for the Genoese War, he is assessed
      at 23,000 _Lire_.[8] A history of that war also states that he
      (“Donado Polo del Canareggio”) presented the Government with 1000
      ducats, besides maintaining in arms himself, his son, and seven
      others.[9] Under 1388 we find Donato still living, and mention of
      CATARUZZA, d. of Donato:[10] and under 1390 of Elena, widow of
      Donato.[10]

      The Testamentary Papers of Nicolo also speak of GIACOMO [or
      Jacopo] Polo. He is down in the _Estimo_ of 1379 for 1000
      _Lire_;[11] and in 1371 an inscription in Cicogna shows him
      establishing a family burial-place in Sta. Maria de’ Servi:[12]

      [M°CCC°LXXI. Die primo mensis ... S. Dn̄i IACHOBI. PAVLI. DE
      CFINIO. SANCTI. IEREMIE. ET. SVOR. HEREDVM.]

(1353. 2nd June. Viriola, widow of ANDREA or Andrinolo Polo of Sta.
      Maria Nuova?)[13]

1379. In addition to those already mentioned we have NICOLO assessed at
      4000 _lire_.[11]

1381. And apparently this is the NICOLO, son of Almorò (_Hermolaus_),
      who was raised to the Great Council, for public service rendered,
      among 30 elected to that honour after the war of Chioggia.[14]
      Under 1410 we find ANNA, relict of Nicolo Polo.[15]

1379. In this year also, ALMORÒ, whether father or brother of the last,
      contributes 4000 _lire_ to the Estimo.[11]

1390. CLEMENTE Polo (died before 1397)[15] and his wife MADDALUZIA.[15]
      Also in this year PAOLO Polo, son of Nicolo, gave his daughter in
      marriage to Giov. Vitturi.[16]

1408 and 1411. CHIARA, daughter of Francesco Balbi, and widow of
      ERMOLAO (or Almorò) Polo, called of _Sta. Trinità_.[15]

1416. GIOVANNI, perhaps the Giovannino mentioned above.[15]

1420. 22nd November. BARTOLO, son of Ser ALMORÒ and of the Nobil Donna
      CHIARA Orio.(?)[17] This couple probably the same as in the
      penultimate entry.

1474, _seqq._ Accounts belonging to the Trust Estate of BARTOLOMEO Polo
      of S. Geremia.[15]

There remains to be mentioned a MARCO POLO, member of the Greater
Council, chosen _Auditor Sententiarum_, 7th March, 1350, and named
among the electors of the Doges Marino Faliero (1354) and Giovanni
Gradenigo (1355). The same person appears to have been sent as
_Provveditore_ to Dalmatia in 1355. As yet it is doubtful to what
family he belonged, and it is _possible_ that he may have belonged to
our traveller’s branch, and have continued that branch according to the
tradition. But I suspect that he is identical with the Marco, brother
of Nicolo Polo of S. Geremia, mentioned above, under 1348. (See also
vol. i. p. _74_.) Cappellari states distinctly that this Marco was the
father of the Lady who married Azzo Trevisan. (See Introd. p. _78_.)

We have intimated the probability that he was the Marco mentioned twice
in connection with the Court of Sicily. (See vol. i. p. _79_, note.)

A later Marco Polo, in 1537, distinguished himself against the Turks
in command of a ship called the _Giustiniana_; forcing his way past
the enemy’s batteries into the Gulf of Prevesa, and cannonading that
fortress. But he had to retire, being unsupported.

It may be added that a Francesco Paulo appears among the list of those
condemned for participation in the conspiracy of Baiamonte Tiepolo in
1310. (_Dandulo_ in _Mur._ XII. 410, 490.)

[I note from the MS. of _Priuli, Genealogie delle famiglie nobili
di Venesia_, kept in the Rᵒ. Archivio di Stato at Venice, some
information, pp. 4376–4378, which permit me to draw up the following
Genealogy which may throw some light on the Polos of San Geremia:—

Sir Henry Yule writes above (II. p. 507) that Nicolo Polo of S. Geremia
had a brother Marco, and this Marco had a daughter Agnesina. I find in
the Acts of the Notary Brutti, in the Will of Elisabetta Polo, dated
14th March, 1350:—

           BETA = MARCO POLO [MARCOLINO?]

                                      of S. Lorenzo.

The Maffio, son of Nicolò of S. Giov. Grisostomo, and father of Pasqua
and Fiordelisa, married probably after his will (1300) and had his four
sons: Almorò of S. Geremia, Maffio, Marco, Nicolò. Indeed, Cicogna
writes (_Insc. Ven._ II. p. 390):—“Non apparisce che Maffeo abbia avuto
figliuoli maschi da questo testamento [1300]; ma per altro non è cosa
assurda il credere che posteriormente a questo testamento 1300 possa
avere avuti figliuoli maschi; ed in effetto le Genealogie gliene danno
quatro, cioè _Ermolao, Maffio, Marco, Nicolò_. Il Ramusio anzi glien dà
cinque, senza nominarli, uno de’ quali _Marco_, e una femmina di nome
_Maria_; e Marco Barbaro gliene dà sei, cioè _Nicolò, Maria, Pietro,
Donado, Marco, Franceschino_.”—H. C.]

            APPENDIX E.—_The Preface of Friar Pipino to his
                     Latin Version of Marco Polo._

                          (Circa 1315–1320.)


“The Book of that prudent, honourable, and most truthful gentleman,
MESSER MARCO POLO of Venice, concerning the circumstances and manners
of the Regions of the East, which he conscientiously wrote and put
forth in the Vulgar Tongue, I, FRIAR FRANCESCO PIPINO of Bologna,
of the Order of the Preaching Friars, am called upon by a number
of my Fathers and Masters to render faithfully and truthfully out
of the vulgar tongue into the Latin. And this, not merely because
they are themselves persons who take more pleasure in Latin than
in vernacular compositions, but also that those who, owing to the
diversity of languages and dialects, might find the perusal of the
original difficult or impossible, may be able to read the Book with
understanding and enjoyment.

“The task, indeed, which they have constrained me to undertake, is one
which they themselves could have executed more competently, but they
were averse to distract their attention from the higher contemplations
and sublime pursuits to which they are devoted, in order to turn their
thoughts and pens to things of the earth earthy. I, therefore, in
obedience to their orders, have rendered the whole substance of the
Book into such plain Latin as was suited to its subject.

“And let none deem this task to be vain and unprofitable; for I am
of opinion that the perusal of the Book by the Faithful may merit
an abounding Grace from the Lord; whether that in contemplating the
variety, beauty, and vastness of God’s Creation, as herein displayed in
His marvellous works, they may be led to bow in adoring wonder before
His Power and Wisdom; or, that, in considering the depths of blindness
and impurity in which the Gentile Nations are involved, they may be
constrained at once to render thanks to God Who hath deigned to call
His faithful people out of such perilous darkness into His marvellous
Light, and to pray for the illumination of the hearts of the Heathen.
Hereby, also, the sloth of undevout Christians may be put to shame,
when they see how much more ready the nations of the unbelievers are
to worship their Idols, than are many of those who have been marked
with Christ’s Token to adore the True God. Moreover, the hearts of
some members of the religious orders may be moved to strive for the
diffusion of the Christian Faith, and by Divine Aid to carry the Name
of Our Lord Jesus Christ, forgotten among so vast multitudes, to those
blinded nations, among whom the harvest is indeed so great, and the
labourers so few.

“But lest the inexperienced Reader should regard as beyond belief the
many strange and unheard of things that are related in sundry passages
of this Book, let all know MESSER MARCO POLO, the narrator of these
marvels, to be a most respectable, veracious, and devout person, of
most honourable character, and receiving such good testimony from all
his acquaintance, that his many virtues claim entire belief for that
which he relates. His Father, Messer Nicolo, a man of the highest
respectability, used to relate all these things in the same manner. And
his uncle, Messer Maffeo, who is spoken of in the Book, a man of ripe
wisdom and piety, in familiar conversation with his Confessor when on
his death-bed, maintained unflinchingly that the whole of the contents
of this Book were true.

“Wherefore I have, with a safer conscience, undertaken the labour of
this Translation, for the entertainment of my Readers, and to the
praise of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Creator of all things visible and
invisible.”

  Bodleian, No. 264
  _French_

  This is bound up with the celebrated Alexander MS. It is a beautiful
    work, embellished with thirty-eight miniatures, some of which
    are exquisite, _e.g._, the Frontispiece, a large piece of about
    9½ in. × 9 in., forming a sort of condensed view of the Field
    of Travel; a large part of it occupied by VENICE, of which our
    cut (_The Piazzetta_) in vol. i., p. _18, Introduction_, is an
    extract. Another fine work (f. 220) represents the three Polos
    presenting the Pope’s Letter to the Khan. The embroidered hands
    on the Khan’s robe form an inscription, in which is legible
    “_Johannes me fecit_.” This Mr. Coxe attributes to John of Cologne,
    a known artist of the 14th century. He considers the MS. to be of
    about 1380. The Alexander is dated 1338, and its illuminations as
    finished in 1344 by Jehan de Grise. [See _supra_, p. 528, _note_.]
  A comparison of a good many readings, as well as of the point where
    the version breaks off, and the words: “_Explicit le Livre nommé
    du Grant Cann de la Graunt Cité de Cambaluc, Dieux ayde Amen_,”
    indicate that this MS. is of the same type as Pauthier’s C (No. 20
    in this List) and the Bern. MS. (No 63).
  The name given in the colophon as above has caused the work to be
    entered in the old Printed Catalogue under a wrong title. Hence the
    MS., as one of Marco Polo, has been overlooked.

  This is the most precious of all MSS. of Polo. It has been fully
    spoken of (vol. i., _Int., The Old French Text_) under the name of
    the _Geographic Text_ (or G. T.), because it was printed by the
    Société de Géographie in 1824. [See I, p. _83_]
  A large 4to of thick parchment; 112 ff.; very clearly though not very
    neatly written in Gothic text.—14th century.

    other), it bears the certificate regarding the Seigneur de Cepoy.
    (Vol. i., _Int., Notices of Marco in later life._) The MS. is fully
    described in Sinner’s Catalogue. It is in very beautiful condition,
    very clearly written on parchment, with all the initials filled up
    in gold and colours, and with numerous flowered scrolls.
  It belonged to Bongars, whose autograph is on it: “_Bongars—l’a de la
    courtoisie de Mr. de Superville._”

  _French_

  This MS., published in facsimile by Baron A. E. Nordenskiöld,
    belongs to the “Cepoy” type of MSS. Yule wrote in _The Athenæum_
    (17th June, 1882): “I gather that it has been produced by partial
    abridgement from one of the earlier MSS. of the type in question.”
    And again (p. 766): “It will be seen that though the publication is
    a beautiful example of facsimile, it contributes, as far as I have
    been able to examine it, nothing to the amelioration or elucidation
    of the text or narrative.”
  The changes and suppressions are much less considerable than in the
    Paris MSS., 5631 and 2810. Cf _L. Delisle, Bib. de l’Ecole des
    Chartes_, XLIII., 1882, pp. 226–235, 424.
  It is incomplete, and ends: “_Et se aucuns disoit quí a luí._”—Cf.
    Paris MS., 1880. [Our No. 22.]
  It belonged to the Library of the French King, Charles V.
    (1364–1380), and later, as marked on the recto of the last
    folio, “Pour Symon du Solier demorant à Honnefleu,” who was

[1] ✛ This MS. Fr. 2810 (formerly 8392), known as the _Livre des
    Merveilles_, belonged to the Library of John, Duke of Berry, at
    the Château of Mehun-sur-Yevre, 1416, No. 116 of the catalogue;
    also No. 196, p. 186, of _Le Cabinet des Manuscrits de la Bibl.

[2] [Mr. E. W. B. Nicholson, who thought at first that this MS. was
    written at the end of the 14th century, in his Introduction to
    _Early Bodleian Music_, by J. F. R. Stainer and C. Stainer, London,
    1901, has come to the conclusion (p. xviii.) that it belongs to the
    first half of the 15th century. I agree with him. Mr. Nicholson
    thinks that the writing is English, and that the miniatures are by
    a Flemish artist; Mr. Holmes, the King’s Librarian, believes that
    both writing and miniatures are English. This MS. came into the
    Bodleian Library between 1598 and 1605, and was probably given by
    Sir Thomas Bodley himself.—H. C.]

           APPENDIX H.—_Bibliography of Marco Polo’s Book_.


                        I.—PRINCIPAL EDITIONS.


We attempt a list of all the editions of Polo; a task for which Sir
Henry Yule had no advantages, and which will be found well done for the
time in Lazari’s Appendix, based on Marsden. It may be also useful to
mention the chief Editions, with their dates.

1477. The first Printed Edition is in German. We give a reduced
      Facsimile of its Frontispiece. (See p. 555.)

1481. A reproduction of the preceding at Augsburg, in the same volume
      with the _History of Duke Leopold and his Son William of Austria_.

About 1490. Pipino’s Latin; the only printed edition of that version.
      Without place, date, or printer’s name. (See p. 558.)

1496. Edition in Venetian Dialect, printed by J. B. da Sessa.

1500. The preceding reproduced at Brescia (often afterwards in Italy).

1502. Portuguese version from Pipino, along with the Travels of Nicolo
      Conti. Printed at Lisbon by Valentym Fernandez Alemao (see vol.
      ii. of this work, p. 295). Stated to have been translated from
      the MS. presented by Venice to Prince Pedro (vol. i. p. _135_.)

1503. Spanish version by Rodrigo de Santaella. _Sevilla_.

1529. Ditto. Reprinted at Logroño.

1532. Novus Orbis—Basileæ. (See vol. i. p. _95_.)

1556. French version from the _Novus Orbis_.

1559. Ramusio’s 2nd volume, containing his version of Polo, of which we
      have spoken amply.

1579. First English Version, made by John Frampton, according to
      Marsden, from the Spanish version of Seville or Logroño.

1625. Purchas’s _Pilgrims_, vol. iii. contains a very loose translation
      from Ramusio.

1664. Dutch Version, from the _Novus Orbis. Amsterdam_.

1671. Andreas Müller of Greiffenhagen reprints the Latin of the _Novus
      Orbis_, with a collation of readings from the Pipino MS. at
      Berlin; and with it the book of Hayton, and a disquisition _De
      Chataiâ_. The Editor appears to have been an enthusiast in his
      subject, but he selected his text very injudiciously. (See vol.
      i. p. _96_.)

1735. Bergeron’s interesting collection of Mediæval Travels in Asia,
      published in French at the Hague. The _Polo_ is a translation
      from Müller, and hence is (as we have already indicated) at 6th
      hand.

1747. In Astley’s Collection, IV. 580 _seqq._, there is an abstract of
      Polo’s book, with brief notes, which are extremely acute, though
      written in a vulgar tone, too characteristic of the time.

1818. Marsden’s famous English Edition.

1824. The Publication of the most valuable MS. and most genuine form of
      the text, by the Soc. de Géographie of Paris. (See vol. i. p.
      _83_.) It also contains the Latin Text (No. 24 in our list of
      MSS. App. F.).

1827. Baldelli-Boni published the Crusca MS. (No. 40), and republished
      the Ramusian Version, with numerous notes, and interesting
      dissertations. The 2 volumes are cumbered with 2 volumes more
      containing, as a Preliminary, a History of the Mutual Relations
      of Europe and Asia, which probably no man ever read. _Florence_.

1844. Hugh Murray’s Edition. It is, like the present one, eclectic as
      regards the text, but the Editor has taken large liberties with
      the arrangement of the Book.

1845. Bürck’s German Version, Leipzig. It is translated from Ramusio,
      with copious notes, chiefly derived from Marsden and Ritter.
      There are some notes at the end added by the late Karl Friedrich
      Neumann, but as a whole these are disappointing.

1847. Lazari’s Italian edition was prepared at the expense of the late
      Senator T. Pasini, in commemoration of the meeting of the Italian
      Scientific Congress at Venice in that year, to the members of
      which it was presented. It is a creditable work, but too hastily
      got up.

1854. Mr. T. Wright prepared an edition for Bohn’s _Antiq. Library_.
      The notes are in the main (and professedly) abridged from
      Marsden’s, whose text is generally followed, but with
      the addition of the historical chapters, and a few other
      modifications from the Geographic Text.

1854–57. _Voyageurs Anciens et Modernes, &c. Par M. Ed. Charton.
      Paris._ An interesting and creditable popular work. Vol. ii.
      contains Marco Polo, with many illustrations, including copies
      from miniatures in the _Livre des Merveilles_. (See list in App.
      F. p. 528.)

1863. Signor Adolfo Bartoli reprinted the Crusca MS. from the original,
      making a careful comparison with the Geographic Text. He has
      prefixed a valuable and accurate Essay on Marco Polo and the
      Literary History of his Book, by which I have profited.

1865. M. Pauthier’s learned edition.

1871. First edition of the present work.

1873. First publication of Marco Polo in Russian.

1875. Second edition of this work.

1882. Facsimile of the French Stockholm MS. by Baron A. E. Nordenskiöld.

Nuremberg, in 1477.

[Illustration: Frontispiece of the first German Edition.]

The copy which I have examined is in the Grenville Library, No. 6787.
(Vide _Bib. Grenvilliana_, Part II. p. 305.) When Marsden edited his
_Marco Polo_, Grenville did not possess this edition. The only known
copy was in the Vienna Imperial Library, but was without the portrait.
Grenville had made a transcript spoken of by Marsden, pp. lxx.–lxxi.,
which we describe _infra_. “When Mr. Marsden,” says Grenville in a MS.
note at the beginning of this fine volume, “published his translation
of this work, the only known copy of this first German Edition was in
the Imperial Library at Vienna, and I had a literal transcript made
from it: Since that time a second copy was found and sold by Payne and
Foss to Lord Spencer: and now I have purchased from Leipsick a third
[the present] beautiful copy. I know of no fourth copy. The copy at
Vienna wants the portrait.”

Vide _Bib. Spenceriana_, vol. vi. p. 176.

Other copies are to be found at the Imperial Library, Vienna, the Royal
Library, Berlin, the _Germanisches Museum_, Nuremberg; a sixth copy
was in the Crawford Collection (London, June, 1887, 1359) with the
portrait, and was purchased by B. Quaritch. [See _H. Cordier, Cent. of
Marco Polo_, p. 41.]

—The copy we just spoke of has No. LII. in the Grenville collection,
British Museum; it is a folio of 114 pages numbered with a pencil;
bound with the arms of the Rᵗ. Honbˡᵉ. Thoˢ. Grenville. Page 114, the
exactness of this copy is thus certified: “Apographum collatum cum
prototypo, quod in Bibliotheca Palatina Vindobonensi adservatur. Illo
quidem, qui descripsit, recitante ex prototypo, me vero hoc apographum
inspectante. Respondet pagina paginae, versui versus & syllaba
syllabae. Vindobonae die 29. Augusti 1817. B. Kopitar, Biblioth.
Palatinae Vindobon. scriptor.”

With this manuscript is bound a letter addressed to Mr. Grenville
by the Chevalier Scotti, who had the copy made; it is dated “Vienne
20 nmbre 1817,” and ends with this post-scriptum: “N. B. Comme cette
Edition fort peu connue du 477. est une édition non seulement
précieuse, mais à la vérité fort rare aussi, elle avoit été prise
par les François et portée à Paris la dernière fois qu’ils ont été à
Vienne. Elle y a été rendue avec tout le reste qu’on avoit emporté à la
suite des heureux succès des Coilisés, auxquels L’immortel Wellington
a tant contribué en y mettant la dernière couronne dont les lauriers
resteront à jamais inflétrissables.”

2.—2. Augsburg ... 1481.

“Edition fort rare, dit Brunet, et la plus ancienne que l’on ait de
cette version latine de Marco Polo, faite par Pipino, vers 1320.
Elle est imprimée avec les mêmes caractères, que l’_Itinerarium_ de
Joan. de Mandeville, c’est-à-dire par Gerard de Leeu, à Anvers, vers
1485, et non pas à Rome et à Venise, comme on l’avait supposé. Vend.
4 liv. 14 sh. 6d. Hanrott; 7 liv. Libri en 1859. (_Choicer portion_,
1562.)” Brunet writes elsewhere (cf. _Mandeville_ par H. Cordier) about
Mandeville from the same press: “... La souscription que nous allons
rapporter semble prouver qu’elle a été imprimée à Venise; cependant
Panzer, IX, 200, la croit sortie des presses de Theodoric Martin, à
Aloste, et M. Grenville en trouvait les caractères conformes à ceux
que Gérard Leeu a employés à Anvers, de 1484–1485. M. Campbell (_Ann.
de la typ. néerlandaise_) la donne à Gérard Leeu, et fixe la date de
l’impression à la première année du séjour de ce typographe à Anvers,
après son départ de Gouda.”

It is certain from the use of the signatures =a=, =aa=, =a=, and the
similitude of the type of the three works, that the _Mandeville_, the
_Ludolphe_, and the _Marco Polo_ come from the same printing office,
and have been printed together as it seems to be proved by the copy
of the Sunderland Library, which was complete and contained the three
works.

Lazari, p. 460, writes: “Jo. de Mandeville itineraria: Dom. Ludolph.

The copy which I have examined is in the Grenville Library, No.
6666. It is in fine condition and complete, notwithstanding what the
Sobolewski Sale Catalogue says to the contrary (No. 1730): it is
a small 8vo ff. 84; each quire containing, as is indicated by the
register, eight sheets, except quire l, which has but four.

Grenville added to his copy the following note: “This appears to be the
first edition printed in the original Italian.—The Abbé Morelli who
sent me this book from Venice had found great difficulty in procuring a
copy for the Library of St. Marc.—Panzer III. 396, refers only to the
mention made of it by Denis. Supp. I, pᵉ 415. I know of no other copy
in England....”

Lazari, p. 460, says: “Prima e rarissima edizione del compendio

capitolo non forma però parte d’esso, come nelle molte ristampe di

it belonged to the Louvre, to Solier of Honfleur, to Paul Petau when it

   III.—TITLES OF SUNDRY BOOKS AND PAPERS WHICH TREAT OF MARCO POLO
                             AND HIS BOOK.


1. SALVIATI, Cavalier LIONARDO. _Degli Avvertimenti della Lingua
      sopra ’l Decamerone_. In Venezia, 1584.

Has some brief remarks on Texts of Polo, and on references to him or
his story in Villani and Boccaccio.

2. MARTINI, MARTINO. _Novus Atlas Sinensis_. Amstelodami, 1655.

The Maps are from Chinese sources, and are surprisingly good. The
Descriptions, also from Chinese works but interspersed with information
of Martini’s own, have, in their completeness, never been superseded.
This estimable Jesuit often refers to Polo with affectionate zeal,
identifying his localities, and justifying his descriptions. The
edition quoted in this book forms a part of Blaeu’s Great Atlas (1663).
It was also reprinted in Thévenot’s Collection.

3. KIRCHER, ATHANASIUS. _China Illustrata_. Amstelodami, 1667.

He also often refers to Polo, but chiefly in borrowing from Martini.

4. MAGAILLANS, GABRIEL DE (properly _Magalhaens_). _Nouvelle
      Description de la Chine, contenant la description des
      Particularités les plus considérables de ce Grand Empire_. Paris,
      1688, 4to.

Contains many excellent elucidations of Polo’s work.

5. CORONELLI, VINCENZO. _Atlante Veneto_. Venezia, 1690.

Has some remarks on Polo, and the identity of Cathay and Cambaluc with
China and Peking.

6. MURATORI, LUD. ANT. _Perfetta Poesia, con note di_ SALVINI.
      Venezia, 1724.

This work, which I have not seen, is stated to contain some remarks on
Polo’s Book. The author had intended to write a Commentary thereon,
and had collected books and copies of MSS. with this view, and read an
article on the subject before the Academy of Padua, but did not live to
fulfil his intention (d. 1797).

Mr. Wheeler’s book says; “His travels appear _to have been written_ at
Comorin, the most southerly point of India” (p. 385). The words that I
have put in Italics are evidently a misprint, though it is not clear
how to correct them.

      translated by M. Emile Durand in the _Journ. Asiatique_, sér.
      VII. tom. iv. pp. 122–158 (September, 1874).

The Author expresses his conviction that Marco Polo had described a
number of localities after Chinese written authorities; for in the old
Chinese descriptions of India and other transmarine countries are found
precisely the same pieces of information, neither more nor fewer, that
are given by Marco Polo. Though proof of this would not be proof of
the writer’s deduction that Marco Polo was acquainted with the Chinese
language, it would be very interesting in itself, and would explain
some points to which we have alluded (_e.g._, in reference to the
frankincense plant, p. 396, and to the confusion between Madagascar and
Makdashau, p. 413). And Mr. G. Phillips has urged something of the same
kind. But M. de Skattschkoff adduces no proof at all; and for the rest
his Essay is full of inaccuracy.

important paper, viz.: _Remarks on Marco Polo’s Travels to the North of
China, derived from Chinese Sources; by the_ ARCHIMANDRITE PALLADIUS.
This celebrated traveller and scholar says (as I am informed): ‘I have
followed up the indications of Marco Polo from Lobnor to Shangdu,
and in part to Peking.... It would seem that I have been so fortunate
as to clear up the points that remained obscure to Yule.’ I deeply
regret that my book cannot now profit by these promised remarks. I
am not, however, without hope, that in the present edition, with its
Appendices, some at least of the Venerable Traveller’s identifications
may have been anticipated.”

     APPENDIX K.—_Values of certain Moneys, Weights, and Measures,
                       occurring in this Book_.


                             FRENCH MONEY.

The +Livre Tournois+ of the period may be taken, on
the mean of five valuations cited in a footnote at p.
87 of vol. i., as equal in _modern silver value_ to ... 18·04 _francs._

Say English money                                   ... 14_s._ 3·8_d._

The +Livre Parisis+ was worth one-fourth more than the
_Tournois_,[1] and therefore equivalent in silver value
to                                                  ... 22·55 _francs._

Say English money                                   ... 17_s._ 10·8_d._

(Gold being then to silver in relative value about 12:1 instead of
about 15:1 as now, one-fourth has to be added to the values based on
silver in equations with the gold coin of the period, and one-fifth to
be deducted in values based on gold value. By oversight, in vol. i. p.
87, I took 16:1 as the present gold value, and so exaggerated the value
of the livre Tournois as compared with gold.)

M. Natalis de Wailly, in his recent fine edition of Joinville,
determines the valuation of these _livres_, in the reign of St. Lewis,
by taking a mean between a value calculated on the present value of
silver, and a value calculated on the present value of gold,[2] and his
result is:

      +Livre Tournois+ =                            ... 20·26 _francs._
      +Livre Parisis+ =                             ... 25·33     „

Though there is something arbitrary in this mode of valuation, it is,
perhaps, on the whole the best; and its result is extremely handy for
the memory (as somebody has pointed out) for we thus have

      One +Livre Tournois+ = One Napoleon.
       „     „   +Parisis+ = One Sovereign.


                            VENETIAN MONEY.

The +Mark+ of Silver all over Europe may be taken fairly at 2_l._ 4_s._
of our money in modern value; the Venetian mark being a fraction more,
and the marks of England, Germany and France fractions less.[3]

The Venice +Gold Ducat+ or +Zecchin+, first coined
in accordance with a Law of 31st October 1283, was,
_in our gold value_, worth                          ... 11·82 _francs._[4]
      or English                                    ...  9_s._ 4·284_d._

The Zecchin when first coined was fixed as equivalent to 18 _grossi_,
and on this calculation the +Grosso+ should be a little less than 5_d._
sterling.[5] But from what follows it looks as if there must have been
another _grosso_, perhaps only of account, which was only ¾ of the
former, therefore equivalent to 3¾_d._ only. This would be a clue to
difficulties which I do not find dealt with by anybody in a precise or
thorough manner; but I can find no evidence for it.

Accounts were kept at Venice not in ducats and grossi, but in _Lire_,
of which there were several denominations, _viz._:

    1. +Lira dei Grossi+, called in Latin Documents _Libra denariorum
      Venetorum grosorum_.[6] Like every _Lira_ or Pound, this
      consisted of 20 _soldi_, and each _soldo_ of 12 _denari_ or
      _deniers_.[7] In this case the Lira was equivalent to 10 golden
      ducats; and its Denier, as the name implies, was the _Grosso_.
      The Grosso therefore here was ¹⁄₂₄₀ of 10 ducats or ¹⁄₂₄ of a
      ducat, instead of ¹⁄₁₈.

    2. +Lira ai Grossi+ (_L. den. Ven. ad grossos_). This by decree of
      2nd June, 1285, went two to the ducat. In fact it is the _soldo_
      of the preceding _Lira_, and as such the _Grosso_ was, as we have
      just seen, its denier; which is perhaps the reason of the name.

    3. +Lira dei Piccoli+ (_L. den. Ven. parvulorum_). The ducat is
      alleged to have been at first equal to three of these _Lire_
      (_Romanin_, I. 321); but the calculations of Marino Sanudo
      (1300–1320) in the _Secreta Fidelium Crucis_ show that he reckons
      the Ducat equivalent to 3·2 _lire_ of _piccoli_.[8]

In estimating these _Lire_ in modern English money, on the basis of
their relation to the ducat, we must reduce the apparent value by ⅕. We
then have:

    1. +Lira dei Grossi+ equivalent to nearly 3_l._ 15_s._ 0_d._
      (therefore exceeding by nearly 10_s._ the value of the Pound
      sterling of the period, or _Lira di Sterlini_, as it was called
      in the appropriate Italian phrase).[9]

    2. +Lira ai Grossi+                             ... 3_s._ 9_d._

    3. +Lira dei Piccoli+                           ... 2_s._ 4_d._

The +Tornese+ or +Tornesel+ at Venice was, according to Romanin (III.
343) = 4 Venice deniers: and if these are the _deniers_ of the _Lira ai
Grossi_, the coin would be worth a little less than ¾_d._, and nearly
the equivalent of the denier Tournois, from which it took its name.[10]

                   *       *       *       *       *

The term +Bezant+ is used by Polo always (I believe) as it is by
Joinville, by Marino Sanudo, and by Pegolotti, for the Egyptian gold
dínár, the intrinsic value of which varied somewhat, but can scarcely
be taken at less than 10_s._ 6_d._ or 11_s._ (See _Cathay_, pp.
440–441; and see also _J. As._ sér. VI. tom. xi. pp. 506–507.) The
exchange of Venice money for the Bezant or Dinar in the Levant varied
a good deal (as is shown by examples in the passage in _Cathay_ just
cited), but is always in these examples a large fraction (⅙ up to ⅓)
more than the Zecchin. Hence, when Joinville gives the equation of St.
Lewis’s ransom as 1,000,000 _bezants_ or 500,000 _livres_, I should
have supposed these to be _livres Parisis_ rather than _Tournois_, as
M. de Wailly prefers.

There were a variety of coins of lower value in the Levant called
Bezants,[11] but these do not occur in our Book.

                   *       *       *       *       *

The Venice +Saggio+, a weight for precious substances was ⅙ of an
ounce, corresponding to the weight of the Roman gold _solidus_, from
which was originally derived the Arab +Misḳál+. And Polo appears to
use _saggio_ habitually as the equivalent of _Misḳál_. His +pois+ or
+peso+, applied to gold and silver, seems to have the same sense, and
is indeed a literal translation of _Misḳál_. (See vol. ii. p. 41.)

                   *       *       *       *       *

For measures Polo uses the _palm_ rather than the foot. I do not find
a value of the Venice palm, but over Italy that measure varies from 9½
inches to something over 10. The Genoa Palm is stated at 9·725 inches.

_Jal_ (_Archéologie Nav._ I. 271) cites the following Table of

      _Old Venice Measures of Length_.

        4 fingers      = 1 handbreadth.
        4 handbreadths = 1 foot.
        5 feet         = 1 pace.
        1000 paces     = 1 mile.
        4 miles        = 1 league.

[1] See (_Dupré de St. Maur_) _Essai sur les Monnoies, &c._ Paris,
    1746, p. xv; and _Douet d’Arcq_, pp. 5, 15, &c.

[2] He takes the _silver value_ of the gros Tournois (the _sol_ of the
    system) at 0·8924 _fr._, whence the Livre = 17·849 _fr._ And the
    _gold value_ of the golden _Agnel_, which passed for 12½ _sols
    Tournois_, is 14·1743 _fr._ Whence the Livre = 22·6789 _fr._ Mean =
    20·2639 _fr._

[3] The Mark was ⅔ of a pound. The English +Pound Sterling+ of the
    period was in silver value = 3_l._ 5_s._ 2_d._ Hence the +Mark+
    = 2_l._ 3_s._ 5·44_d._ The Cologne Mark, according to Pegolotti,
    was the same, and the Venice Mark of silver was = 1 English Tower
    Mark + 3½ sterlings (_i.e._ pence of the period), = therefore to
    2_l._ 4_s._ 4·84_d._ The French Mark of Silver, according to Dupré
    de St. Maur, was about 3 Livres, presumably Tournois, and therefore
    2_l._ 2_s._ 11½_d._

[4] _Cibrario, Pol. Ec. del Med. Evo._ III. 228. The +Gold Florin+ of
    Florence was worth a fraction more = 9_s._ 4·85_d._

    Sign. Desimoni, of Genoa, obligingly points out that the changed
    relation of Gold ducat and silver _grosso_ was due to a general
    rise in price of gold between 1284 and 1302, shown by notices of
    other Italian mints which raise the equation of the gold florin in
    the same ratio, viz. from 9 _sols tournois_ to 12.

[5] For ¹⁄₁₈ of the florin will be 6·23_d._, and deducting ⅕, as
    pointed out above, we have 4·99_d._ as the value of the _grosso_.

    I have a note that the _grosso_ contained 42⁶⁸⁄₁₄₄ Venice grains of
    pure silver. If the Venice grain be the same as the old Milan grain
    (·051 _grammes_) this will give exactly the same value of 5_d._

[6] Also called, according to Romanin, _Lira d’imprestidi_. See Introd.
    Essay in vol. i. p. _66_.

[7] It is not too universally known to be worth noting that our £. s.
    d. represents _Livres, sois, deniers_.

[8] He also states the grosso to have been worth 32 _piccoli_, which
    is consistent with this and the two preceding statements. For at
    3·2 _lire_ to the ducat the latter would = 768 piccoli, and ¹⁄₂₄ of
    this = 32 piccoli. Pegolotti also assigns 24 grossi to the ducat
    (p. 151).

    The tendency of these _Lire_, as of pounds generally, was to
    degenerate in value. In Uzzano (1440) we find the Ducat equivalent
    to 100 _soldi_, _i.e._ to 5 _lire_.

    Everybody seems to be tickled at the notion that the Scotch Pound
    or Livre was only 20 Pence. Nobody finds it funny that the French
    or Italian Pound is only 20 halfpence, or less!

[9] _Uzzano_ in _Della Decima_, IV. 124.

[10] According to Gallicciolli (II. 53) _piccoli_ (probably in the vague
    sense of small copper coin) were called in the Levant τορνέσια.

[11] Thus in the document containing the autograph of King Hayton,
    presented at p. _13_ of Introductory Essay, the King gives with
    his daughter, “Damoiselle Femie,” a dowry of 25,000 _besans
    sarrazinas_, and in payment 4 of his own bezants _staurats_
    (presumably so called from bearing a _cross_) are to count as one
    Saracen Bezant. (_Cod. Diplomat. del S. Mil. Ord. Gerosolim_. I.

             1.—THE POLOS AT ACRE. (Vol. i. p. _19. Int._)

M. le Comte Riant (_Itin. à Jérusalem_, p. xxix.) from various data
thinks the two sojourns of the Polos at Acre must have been between
the 9th May, 1271, date of the arrival of Edward of England and of
Tedaldo Visconti, and the 18th November, 1271, time of the departure of
Tedaldo. Tedaldo was still in Paris on the 28th December, 1269, and he
appears to have left for the Holy Land after the departure of S. Lewis
for Tunis (2nd July, 1270).—H. C.


               2.—SORCERY IN KASHMIR. (Vol. i. p. 166.)

In _Kalhaṇa’s Rājataraṅgiṇī, A Chronicle of the Kings of Kásmīr
translated by M. A. Stein_, we read (Bk. IV. 94, p. 128): “Again
the Brahman’s wife addressed him: ‘O king, as he is famous for his
knowledge of charms (_Khārkhodavidyā_), he can get over an ordeal with
ease.’” Dr. Stein adds the following note: “The practice of witchcraft
and the belief in its efficiency have prevailed in Kásmir from early
times, and have survived to some extent to the present day; comp.
_Bühler, Report_, p. 24.... The term _Khārkhoda_, in the sense of a
kind of deadly charm or witchcraft, recurs in v. 239, and is found also
in the _Vijayésvaramāh_ (Adipur.), xi. 25. In the form _Khārkoṭa_ it
is quoted by the _N. P. W._ from _Caraka_, vi. 23. _Khārkhoṭa_ appears
as the designation of a sorcerer or another kind of uncanny persons in
_Haracar_., ii. 125, along with Kṛtyās and Vetālas....”


                   3.—PAONANO PAO. (Vol. i. p. 173.)

In his paper on _Zoroastrian Deities on Indo-Scythians’ Coins_
(_Babylonian and Oriental Record_, August, 1887, pp. 155–166; rep. in
the _Indian Antiquary_, 1888), Dr. M. A. Stein has demonstrated that
the legend PAONANO PAO on the coins of the Yue-Chi or Indo-Scythian
Kings (Kanishka, Huvishka, Vasudeva), is the exact transcription of the
old Iranian title _Shāhanān Shāh_ (Persian _Shāhan-shāh_), “King of
Kings”; the letter P, formerly read as P(_r_), has since been generally
recognised, in accordance with his interpretation as a distinct
character expressing the sound _sh_.


                   4.—PAMIR. (Vol. i. pp. 174–175.)

I was very pleased to find that my itinerary agrees with that of Dr.
M. A. Stein; this learned traveller sends me the following remarks:
“The remark about the absence of birds (pp. 174–175) _might_ be a
reflex of the very ancient legend (based probably on the name zend
_Upairi-saena_, pehlevi _Apārsīn_, ‘higher than the birds’) which
represents the _Híndu Kush_ range proper as too high for birds to fly
over. The legend can be traced by successive evidence in the case
of the range north of Kabul.”—Regarding the route (p. 175) from
the _Wakhjir_ (sic) Pass down the Taghdum-bash Pamir, then _viâ_
Tāsh-kurghan, Little Karakul, Bulun Kul, Gez Daria to Tashmalik and
Kashgar, Dr. Stein says that he surveyed it in July, 1900, and he
refers for the correct phonetic spelling of local names along it to his
map to be published in _J. R. G. S._, in December, 1902. He says in
his _Prel. Report_, p. 10: “The _Wakhjīr_ Pass, only some 12 miles to
the south-west of _Kök-török_, connects the Tāghdumbāsh Pamir and the
Sarīkol Valleys with the head-waters of the Oxus. So I was glad that
the short halt, which was unavoidable for survey purposes, permitted
me to move a light camp close to the summit of the Wakhjīr Pass (circ.
16,200 feet). On the following day, 2nd July, I visited the head of
_Ab-i-Panja_ Valley, near the great glaciers which Lord Curzon first
demonstrated to be the true source of the River Oxus. It was a strange
sensation for me in this desolate mountain waste to know that I had
reached at last the eastern threshold of that distant region, including
Bactria and the Upper Oxus Valley, which as a field of exploration
had attracted me long before I set foot in India. Notwithstanding its
great elevation, the Wakhjīr Pass and its approaches both from west and
east are comparatively easy. Comparing the topographical facts with
Hiuen-Tsiang’s account in the _Si yu-ki_, I am led to conclude that
the route followed by the great Chinese Pilgrim, when travelling about
A.D. 649 from Badakshān towards Khotan, through ‘the valley of Po-mi-lo
(Pamir)’ into Sarīkol, actually traversed this Pass.”

Dr. Stein adds in his notes to me that “Marco Polo’s description of the
forty days’ journey to the E.N.E. of _Vokhan_ as _through tracts of
wilderness_ can well be appreciated by any one who has passed through
the Pamir Region, in the direction of the valleys W. and N. of Muztagh
Ata. After leaving Táshkurghan and Tagharma, where there is some
precarious cultivation, there is no local produce to be obtained until
the oasis of Tashmalik is reached in the open Kashgar plains. In the
narrow valley of the Yamanyar River (Gez Defile) there is scarcely any
grazing; its appearance is far more desolate than that of the elevated
Pamirs.”—“Marco Polo’s praise (p. 181) of the gardens and vine-yards of
Kashgar is well deserved; also the remark about the trading enterprise
of its merchants still holds good, if judged by the standard of Chinese
Turkestan. Kashgar traders visit Khotan far more frequently than _vice
versa_. It is strange that no certain remains of Nestorian worship
can be traced now.”—“My impression [Dr. Stein’s] of the people of the
Khotan oasis (p. 188) was that they are certainly a meeker and more
docile race than _e.g._ the average ‘Kashgarlik’ or Yarkandi. The very
small number of the Chinese garrison of the districts Khotan and Keria
(only about 200 men) bears out this impression.”

We may refer for the ancient sites, history, etc., of Khotan to the
_Preliminary Report_ of Dr. Stein and to his paper in the _Geographical
Journal_ for December, 1902, actually in the press.


                5.—NUMBER OF PAMIRS. (Vol. i. p. 176.)

Lord Curzon gives the following list of the “eight claimants to the
distinction and title of a Pamir”: (1) Taghdumbash, or Supreme Head of
the Mountains Pamir, lying immediately below and to the north of the
Kilik Pass. (2) The Pamir-i-Wakhan. (3) The Pamir-i-Khurd, or Little
Pamir. (4) The Pamir-i-Kalan, or Great Pamir. (5) The Alichur Pamir.
(6) The Sarez Pamir. (7) The Rang Kul Pamir. (8) The Khargosh or Hare
Pamir, which contains the basin of the Great Kara Kul. See this most
valuable paper, _The Pamirs and the Source of the Oxus_, reprinted from
the _Geographical Journal_ of 1896, in 1896, 1898, and 1899.

[Illustration: Some of the objects found by Dr. M. A. Stein in Central
  Asia.]


                      6.—PEIN. (Vol. i. p. 192.)

Dr. M. A. Stein, of the Indian Educational Service, appears to have
exactly identified the site of Pein, during his recent archæological
researches in Central Asia; he writes (_Prel. Report on a Journey of
Archæological and Topog. Exploration in Chinese Turkestan_, Lond.,
1901, pp. 58–59): “Various antiquarian and topographical considerations
made me anxious to identify the position of the town of _Pi-mo_, which
Hiuen-Tsiang describes as some 300 _li_ to the east of the Khotan
capital. It was probably the same place as the _Pein_, visited by Marco
Polo. After marching back along the Keriya River for four days, I
struck to the south-west, and, after three more marches, arrived in the
vicinity of Lachin-Ata Mazar, a desolate little shrine in the desert to
the north of the Khotan-Keriya route. Though our search was rendered
difficult by the insufficiency of guides and the want of water, I
succeeded during the following few days in tracing the extensive
ruined site which previous information had led me to look for in that
vicinity. ‘Uzun-Tati’ (‘the distant Tati,’) as the _débris_-covered
area is locally designated, corresponds in its position and the
character of its remains exactly to the description of Pi-mo. Owing to
far-advanced erosion and the destruction dealt by treasure-seekers, the
structural remains are very scanty indeed. But the _débris_, including
bits of glass, pottery, china, small objects in brass and stone, etc.,
is plentiful enough, and in conjunction with the late Chinese coins
found here, leaves no doubt as to the site having been occupied up to
the Middle Ages.”

Our itinerary should therefore run from Khotan to Uzun Tati, and thence
to Nia, leaving Kiria to the south; indeed Kiria is _not_ an ancient
place.—H. C.

A.D. From the description sent to me by Mr. Rapson and written by Mr.
Andrews, I note that the miscellaneous objects include: “Two fragments
of fine Chinese porcelain, highly glazed and painted with Chinese
ornament in blue. That on the left is painted on both sides, and
appears to be portion of rim of a bowl. Thickness ³⁄₃₂ of an inch. That
to the right is slightly coarser, and is probably portion of a larger
vessel. Thickness ¼ inch (nearly). A third fragment of porcelain, shown
at bottom of photo, is decorated roughly in a neutral brown colour,
which has imperfectly ‘fluxed.’ It, also, appears to be Chinese.
Thickness ⅛ inch (nearly).—A brass or bronze object, cast. Probably
portion of a clasp or buckle.—A brass finger ring containing a piece of
mottled green glass held loosely in place by a turned-over denticulated
rim. The metal is very thin.”—H. C.


                    7.—FIRE-ARMS. (Vol. i. p. 342.)

From a paper on _Siam’s Intercourse with China_, published by
Lieutenant-Colonel Gerini in the _Asiatic Quarterly Review_ for
October, 1902, it would appear that fire-arms were mentioned for the
first time in Siamese Records during the Lāu invasion and the siege
of Swankhalôk (from 1085 to 1097 A.D.); it is too early a date for
the introduction of fire-arms, though it would look “much more like
an anachronism were the advent of these implements of warfare [were]
placed, in blind reliance upon the _Northern Chronicles_, still a few
centuries back. The most curious of it all is, however, the statement
as to the weapons in question having been introduced into the country
from China.” Following W. F. Mayers in his valuable contributions to
the _Jour. North-China B. R. A. S._, 1869–1870, Colonel Gerini, who, of
course, did not know of Dr. Schlegel’s paper, adds: “It was not until
the reign of the Emperor Yung Lê, and on occasion of the invasion of
Tonkin in A.D. 1407, that the Chinese acquired the knowledge of the
propulsive effect of gunpowder, from their vanquished enemies.”


                   8.—LA COUVADE. (Vol. ii. p. 91.)

Mr. H. Ling Roth has given an interesting paper entitled _On the
Signification of Couvade_, in the _Journ. Anthropological Institute_,
XXII. 1893, pp. 204–243. He writes (pp. 221–222):—“From this survey
it would seem in the first place that we want a great deal more
information about the custom in the widely isolated cases where it
has been reported, and secondly, that the authenticity of some of the
reported cases is doubtful in consequence of authors repeating their
predecessors’ tales, as Colquhoun did Marco Polo’s, and V. der Haart
did Schouten’s. I should not be at all surprised if ultimately both
Polo’s and Schouten’s accounts turned out to be myths, both these
travellers making their records at a time when the Old World was full
of the tales of the New, so that in the end, we may yet find the custom
is not, nor ever has been, so widespread as is generally supposed to
have been the case.”

I do not very well see how Polo, in the 13th and 14th centuries could
make his _record at a time when the Old World was full of the tales
of the New_, discovered at the end of the 15th century! Unless Mr.
Ling Roth supposes the Venetian Traveller acquainted with the various
theories of the Pre-Columbian discovery of America!!


                9.—ALACAN. (Vol. ii. pp. 255 and 261.)

Dr. G. Schlegel writes, in the _T’oung Pao_ (May, 1898, p. 153):
“_Abakan_ or _Abachan_ ought to be written _Alahan_. His name is
written by the Chinese _Ats’zehan_ and by the Japanese _Asikan_; but
this is because they have both confounded the character _lah_ with the
character _ts’ze_; the old sound of [the last] character [of the name]
was _kan_ and is always used by the Chinese when wanting to transcribe
the title _Khan_ or _Chan_. Marco Polo’s A_b_acan is a clerical error
for A_l_acan.”


                    10.—CHAMPA. (Vol. ii. p. 268.)

In Ma Huan’s account of the Kingdom of Siam, transl. by Mr. Phillips
(_Jour. China B. R. A. S._, XXI. 1886, pp. 35–36) we read: “Their
marriage ceremonies are as follows:—They first invite the priest to
conduct the bridegroom to the bride’s house, and on arrival there the
priest exacts the ‘droit seigneurial,’ and then she is introduced to
the bridegroom.”


                  11.—RUCK QUILLS. (Vol. ii. p. 421.)

Regarding Ruck Quills, Sir H. Yule wrote in the _Academy_, 22nd March,
1884, pp. 204–405:—

“I suggested that this might possibly have been some vegetable
production, such as a great frond of the Ravenala (_Urania speciosa_)
cooked to pass as a ruc’s quill. (_Marco Polo_, first edition, ii.
354; second edition, ii. 414.) Mr. Sibree, in his excellent book on
Madagascar (_The Great African Island_, 1880) noticed this, but said:

“‘It is much more likely that they [the ruc’s quills] were the
immensely long midribs of the leaves of the rofia palm. These are from
twenty to thirty feet long, and are not at all unlike an enormous quill
stripped of the feathering portion’” (p. 55).

In another passage he describes the palm, _Sagus ruffia_ (_? raphia_):

“The _rofia_ has a trunk of from thirty to fifty feet in height, and at
the head divides into seven or eight immensely long leaves. The midrib
of these leaves is a very strong, but extremely light and straight
pole.... These poles are often twenty feet or more in length, and
the leaves proper consist of a great number of fine and long pinnate
leaflets, set at right angles to the midrib, from eighteen to twenty
inches long, and about one and a half broad,” etc. (pp. 74, 75).

When Sir John Kirk came home in 1881–1882, I spoke to him on the
subject, and he felt confident that the _rofia_ or _raphia_ palm-fronds
were the original of the ruc’s quills. He also kindly volunteered to
send me a specimen on his return to Zanzibar. This he did not forget,
and some time ago there arrived at the India Office not one, but four
of these ruc’s quills. In the letter which announced this despatch Sir
John says:—

“I send to-day per s.s. _Arcot_ ... four fronds of the Raphia palm,
called here ‘Moale.’ They are just as sold and shipped up and down the
coast. No doubt they were sent in Marco Polo’s time in exactly the same
state, _i.e._ stripped of their leaflets, and with the tip broken off.
They are used for making stages and ladders, and last long if kept dry.
They are also made into doors, by being cut into lengths, and pinned
through. The stages are made of three, like tripods, and used for
picking cloves from the higher branches.”

The largest of the four midribs sent (they do not differ much) is 25
feet 4 inches long, measuring 12 inches in girth at the butt, and 5
inches at the upper end. I calculate that if it originally came to a
point the whole length would be 45 feet, but, as this would not be so,
we may estimate it at 35 to 40 feet. The thick part is deeply hollowed
on the upper (?) side, leaving the section of the solid butt in form a
thick crescent. The leaflets are all gone, but when entire, the object
must have strongly resembled a Brobdingnagian feather. Compare this
description with that of Padre Bolivar in Ludolf, referred to above.

“In aliquibus ... regionibus vidi pennas alae istius avis prodigiosae,
licet avem non viderim, Penna illa, prout ex formâ colligebatur, erat
ex mediocribus, longitudine 28 palmorum, latitudine trium. Calamus vero
a radice usque ad extremitatem longitudine quinque palmorum, densitatis
instar brachii moderati, robustissimus erat et durus. Pennulae inter
se aequales et bene compositae, ut vix ab invicem nisi cum violentiâ
divellerentur. Colore erant valdê nigro, calamus colore albo.”
(_Ludolfi, ad suam Hist. Aethiop., Comment._, p. 164.)

The last particular, as to colour, I am not able to explain: the others
correspond well. The _palmus_ in this passage may be anything from 9 to
10 inches.

I see this tree is mentioned by Captain R. F. Burton in his volume on
the Lake Regions (vol. xxix. of the _Journal_ of the Royal Geographical
Society, p. 34),[1] and probably by many other travellers.

I ought to mention here that some other object has been shown at
Zanzibar as part of the wings of a great bird. Sir John Kirk writes
that this (which he does not describe particularly) was in the
possession of the Roman Catholic priests at Bagamoyo, to whom it had
been given by natives of the interior, who declared that they had
brought it from Tanganyika, and that it was part of the wing of a
gigantic bird. On another occasion they repeated this statement,
alleging that this bird was known in the Udoe (?) country near the
coast. These priests were able to communicate directly with their
informants, and certainly believed the story. Dr. Hildebrand, also, a
competent German naturalist, believed in it. But Sir John Kirk himself
says that “what the priests had to show was most undoubtedly the
whalebone of a comparatively small whale.”


                 12.—A SPANISH EDITION OF MARCO POLO.

As we go to press we receive the newly published volume, _El Libro
de Marco Polo—Aus dem vermächtnis des_ Dr. Hermann Knust _nach der
Madrider Handschrift herausgegeben von_ Dr. R. Stuebe. Leipzig, Dr.
Seele & Co., 1902, 8vo., pp. xxvi.–114. It reproduces the old Spanish
text of the manuscript Z-I-2 of the Escurial Library from a copy made
by Señor D. José Rodriguez for the Society of the Spanish Bibliophiles,
which, being unused, was sold by him to Dr. Hermann Knust, who made a
careful comparison of it with the original manuscript. This copy, found
among the papers of Dr. Knust after his death, is now edited by Dr.
Stuebe. The original 14th century MS., written in a good hand on two
columns, includes 312 leaves of parchment, and contains several works;
among them we note: 1°, a Collection entitled _Flor de las Ystorias de
Oriente_ (fol. 1–104), made on the advice of Juan Fernandez de Heredia,
Grand Master of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem (1377), of which
_Marco Polo_ (fol. 50–104) is a part; 2° and _Secretum Secretorum_
(fol. 254 _r_-fol. 312 _v._); this MS. is not mentioned in our List,
_App. F._, II. p. 546, unless it be our No. 60.

The manuscript includes 68 chapters, the first of which is devoted
to the City of Lob and Sha-chau, corresponding to our Bk. I., ch.
39 and 40 (our vol. i. pp. 196 _seqq._); ch. 65 (p. 111) corresponds
approximatively to our ch. 40, Bk. III. (vol. ii. p. 451); chs. 66,
67, and the last, 68, would answer to our chs. 2, 3, and 4 of Bk. I.
(vol i., pp. 45 _seqq._). A concordance of this Spanish text, with
Pauthier’s, Yule’s, and the Geographic Texts, is carefully given at the
beginning of each of the 68 chapters of the Book.

Of course this edition does not throw any new light on the text, and
this volume is but a matter of curiosity.


                       13.—SIR JOHN MANDEVILLE.

One of the last questions in which Sir Henry Yule[2] took an interest
in, was the problem of the authorship of the book of Travels which
bears the name of SIR JOHN MANDEVILLE, the worthy Knight, who, after
being for a long time considered as the “Father of English Prose” has
become simply “the name claimed by the compiler of a singular book of
Travels, written in French, and published between 1357 and 1371.”[3]

It was understood that “JOHAN MAUNDEUILLE, chiualer, ia soit ceo qe ieo
ne soie dignes, neez et norriz Dengleterre de la ville Seint Alban,”
crossed the sea “lan millesme cccᵐᵉ vintisme et secund, le iour de
Seint Michel,”[4] that he travelled since across the whole of Asia
during the 14th century, that he wrote the relation of his travels as a
rest after his fatiguing peregrinations, and that he died on the 17th
of November, 1372, at Liège, when he was buried in the Church of the
Guillemins.

No work has enjoyed a greater popularity than Mandeville’s; while
we describe but eighty-five manuscripts of Marco Polo’s, and I gave
a list of seventy-three manuscripts of Friar Odoric’s relation,[5]
it is by hundreds that Mandeville’s manuscripts can be reckoned. As
to the printed editions, they are, so to speak, numberless; Mr. Carl
Schönborn[6] gave in 1840, an incomplete bibliography; Tobler in his
_Bibliographia geographica Palestinae_ (1867),[7] and Röhricht[8] after
him compiled a better bibliography, to which may be added my own lists
in the _Bibliotheca Sinica_[9] and in the _T’oung-Pao_.[10]

Campbell, _Ann. de la Typog. néerlandaise_, 1874, p. 338, mentions a
Dutch edition: _Reysen int heilighe lant_, s.l.n.d., folio, of which
but two copies are known, and which must be dated as far back as 1470
[see p. 600]. I believed hitherto (I am not yet sure that Campbell
is right as to his date) that the first printed edition was German,
s.l.n.d., very likely printed at Basel, about 1475, discovered by
Tross, the Paris Bookseller.[11] The next editions are the French of
the 4th April, 1480,[12] and 8th February of the same year,[13] Easter
being the 2nd of April, then the Latin,[14] Dutch,[15] and Italian[16]
editions, and after the English editions of Pynson and Wynkin de Worde.

In what tongue was Mandeville’s Book written?

The fact that the first edition of it was printed either in German
or in Dutch, only shows that the scientific progress was greater and
printing more active in such towns as Basel, Nuremberg and Augsburg
than in others. At first, one might believe that there were three
original texts, probably in French, English, and vulgar Latin; the
Dean of Tongres, Radulphus of Rivo, a native of Breda, writes indeed
in his _Gesta Pontificum Leodiensium_, 1616, p. 17: “Hoc anno Ioannes
Mandeuilius natione Anglus vir ingenio, & arte medendi eminens, qui
toto fere terrarum orbe peragrato, _tribus linguis_ peregrinationem
suam doctissime _conscripsit_, in alium orbê nullis finibus clausum,
lōgeque hoc quietiorem, & beatiorem migrauit 17. Nouembris. Sepultus
in Ecclesia Wilhelmitarum non procul à moenibus Ciuitatis Leodiensis.”
The Dean of Tongres died in 1483;[17] Mr. Warner, on the authority of
the _Bulletin de l’Inst. Archéol. Liégeois_, xvi. 1882, p. 358, gives
1403 as the date of the death of Radulphus. However, Mandeville himself
says (_Warner, Harley_, 4383) at the end of his introduction, p. 3:—“Et
sachez qe ieusse cest escript mis en latyn pur pluis briefment deuiser;
mes, pur ceo qe plusours entendent mieltz romantz qe latin, ieo lay
mys en romance, pur ceo qe chescun lentende et luy chiualers et les
seignurs et lez autres nobles homes qi ne sciuent point de latin ou
poy, et qount estee outre meer, sachent et entendent, si ieo dye voir
ou noun, et si ieo erre en deuisant par noun souenance ou autrement,
qils le puissent adresser et amender, qar choses de long temps passez
par la veue tornent en obly, et memorie de homme ne puet mye tot
retenir ne comprendre.” From this passage and from the Latin text:
“Incipit itinerarius a terra Angliæ ad partes Iherosolimitanas et in
ulteriores transmarinas, editus primo in lingua gallicana a milite suo
autore anno incarnacionis Domini m. ccc. lv, in civitate Leodiensi, et
paulo post in eadem civitate translatus in hanc formam latinam.” (P.
33 of the _Relation des Mongols ou Tartars par le frère Jean du Plan
de Carpin_, Paris, 1838). D’Avezac long ago was inclined to believe
in an unique French version. The British Museum, English MS. (Cott.,
Titus. C. xvi.), on the other hand, has in the Prologue (cf. ed. 1725,
p. 6): “And zee schulle undirstonde, that I have put this Boke out of
_Latyn_ into _Frensche_, and translated it azen out of _Frensche_ into
_Englyssche_, that every Man of my Nacioun may undirstonde it....”[18]

But we shall see that—without taking into account the important passage
in French quoted above, and probably misunderstood by the English
translator—the English version, a sentence of which, not to be found in
the Latin manuscripts, has just been given, is certainly posterior to
the French text, and therefore that the abstract of Titus C. xvi, has
but a slight value. There can be some doubt only for the French and the
Latin texts.

Dr. Carl Schönborn[19] and Herr Eduard Mätzner,[20] “respectively seem
to have been the first to show that the current Latin and English texts
cannot possibly have been made by Mandeville himself. Dr. J. Vogels
states the same of unprinted Latin versions which he has discovered
in the British Museum, and he has proved it as regards the Italian
version.”[21]

“In Latin, as Dr. Vogels has shown, there are five independent
versions. Four of them, which apparently originated in England (one
manuscript, now at Leyden, being dated in 1390) have no special
interest; the fifth, or vulgate Latin text, was no doubt made at Liège,
and has an important bearing on the author’s identity. It is found in
twelve manuscripts, all of the 15th century, and is the only Latin
version as yet printed.”[22]

The universal use of the French language at the time would be an
argument in favour of the original text being in this tongue, if
corrupt proper names, abbreviations in the Latin text, etc., did not
make the fact still more probable.

The story of the English version, as it is told by Messrs. Nicholson
and Warner, is highly interesting: The English version was made from a
“mutilated archetype,” in French (Warner, p. x.) of the beginning of
the 15th century, and was used for all the known English manuscripts,
with the exception of the Cotton and Egerton volumes—and also for
all the printed editions until 1725. Mr. Nicholson[23] pointed out
that it is defective in the passage extending from p. 36, l. 7: “And
there were to ben 5 Soudans,” to p. 62, l. 25: “the Monkes of the
Abbeye of ten tyme,” in Halliwell’s edition (1839) from Titus C. xvi.
which corresponds to Mr. Warner’s Egerton text, p. 18, l. 21: “for
the Sowdan,” and p. 32, l. 16, “synges oft tyme.” It is this bad text
which, until 1725,[24] has been printed as we just said, with numerous
variants, including the poor edition of Mr. Ashton[25] who has given
the text of East instead of the Cotton text under the pretext that the
latter was not legible.[26]

Two revisions of the English version were made during the first quarter
of the 15th century; one is represented by the British Museum Egerton
MS. 1982 and the abbreviated Bodleian MS. e. Mus. 116; the other by the
Cotton MS. Titus C. xvi. This last one gives the text of the edition
of 1725 often reprinted till Halliwell’s (1839 and 1866).[27] The
Egerton MS. 1982 has been reproduced in a magnificent volume edited
in 1889 for the Roxburghe Club par Mr. G. F. Warner, of the British
Museum;[28] this edition includes also the French text from the Harley
MS. 4383 which, being defective from the middle of chap. xxii. has
been completed with the Royal MS. 20 B. X. Indeed the Egerton MS. 1982
is the only complete English manuscript of the British Museum,[29] as,
besides seven copies of the defective text, three leaves are missing in
the Cotton MS. after f. 53, the text of the edition of 1725 having been
completed with the Royal MS. 17 B.[30]

Notwithstanding its great popularity, Mandeville’s Book could not
fail to strike with its similarity with other books of travels, with
Friar Odoric’s among others. This similarity has been the cause that
occasionally the Franciscan Friar was given as a companion to the
Knight of St. Albans, for instance, in the manuscripts of Mayence
and Wolfenbüttel.[31] Some Commentators have gone too far in their
appreciation and the Udine monk has been treated either as a plagiary
or a liar! Old Samuel Purchas, in his address to the Reader printed
at the beginning of Marco Polo’s text (p. 65), calls his countryman!
Mandeville the greatest Asian traveller next (if next) to Marco Polo,
and he leaves us to understand that the worthy knight has been pillaged
by some priest![32] Astley uses strong language; he calls Odoric a
_great liar!_[33]

Others are fair in their judgment, Malte-Brun, for instance, marked
what Mandeville borrowed from Odoric, and La Renaudière is also very
just in the _Biographie Universelle_. But what Malte-Brun and La
Renaudière showed in a general manner, other learned men, such as
Dr. S. Bormans, Sir Henry Yule, Mr. E. W. B. Nicholson,[34] Dr. J.
Vogels,[35] M. Léopold Delisle, Herr A. Bovenschen,[36] and last, not
least, Dr. G. F. Warner, have in our days proved that not only has
the book bearing Mandeville’s name been compiled from the works of
Vincent of Beauvais, Jacques of Vitry, Boldensel, Carpini, Odoric,
etc., but that it was written neither by a Knight of St. Albans, by
an Englishman, or by a Sir John Mandeville, but very likely by the
physician John of Burgundy or John a Beard.

In a repertory of _La Librairie de la Collégiale de Saint Paul à
Liège au XVᵉ. Siècle_, published by Dr. Stanislas Bormans, in the
_Bibliophile Belge_, Brussels, 1866, p. 236, is catalogued under No.
240: _Legenda de Joseph et Asseneth ejus uxore, in papiro. In eodem
itinerarium Johannis de Mandevilla militis, apud guilhelmitanos
Leodienses sepulti_.

Dr. S. Bormans has added the following note: “Jean Mandeville, ou
Manduith, théologien et mathématicien, était né à St. Alban en
Angleterre d’une famille noble. On le surnomma pour un motif inconnu,
_ad Barbam_ et _magnovillanus_. En 1322, il traversa la France pour
aller en Asie, servit quelque temps dans les troupes du Sultan d’Egypte
et revint seulement en 1355 en Angleterre. Il mourut à Liège chez
les Guilhemins, le 17th Novembre, 1372. Il laissa au dit monastère
plusieurs MSS. de ses œuvres fort vantés, tant de ses voyages que de
la médecine, écrits de sa main; il y avait encore en ladite maison
plusieurs meubles qu’il leur laissa pour mémoire. Il a laissé quelques
livres de médecine qui n’ont jamais été imprimés, des _tabulae
astronomicae_, de _chorda recta et umbra, de doctrina theologica_. La
relation de son voyage est en latin, français et anglais; il raconte,
en y mêlant beaucoup de fables, ce qu’il a vu de curieux en Egypte, en
Arabie et en Perse.”

Then is inserted, an abstract from Lefort, _Liège Herald_, at the end
of the 17th century, from _Jean d’Outremeuse_, which we quote from
another publication of Dr. Bormans’ as it contains the final sentence:
“Mort enfin, etc.” not to be found in the paper of the _Bibliophile
Belge_.

In his introduction to the _Chronique et geste de Jean des Preis dit
d’Outremeuse_, Brussels, F. Hayez, 1887 (_Collection des Chroniques
belges inédites_), Dr. Stanislas Bormans writes, pp. cxxxiii.–cxxxiv.:
“L’an M.CCC.LXXII, mourut à Liège, le 12 Novembre, un homme fort
distingué par sa naissance, avant de s’y faire connoître sous le
nom de Jean de Bourgogne dit à la Barbe. Il s’ouvrit néanmoins au
lit de la mort à Jean d’Outremeuse, son compère, et institué son
exécuteur testamentaire. De vrai il se titra, dans le précis de sa
dernière volonté, messire _Jean de Mandeville, chevalier, comte de
Montfort en Angleterre, et seigneur de l’isle de Campdi et du château
Perouse_. Ayant cependant eu le malheur de tuer, en son pays, un comte
qu’il ne nomme pas, il s’engagea à parcourir les trois parties du
monde. Vint à Liège en 1343. Tout sorti qu’il étoit d’une noblesse
très-distinguée, il aima de s’y tenir caché. Il étoit, au reste, grand
naturaliste, profond philosophe et astrologue, y joint en particulier
une connoissance très singulière de la physique, se trompant rarement
lorsqu’il disoit son sentiment à l’égard d’un malade, s’il en
reviendroit ou pas. Mort enfin, on l’enterra aux F. F. Guillelmins, au
faubourg d’Avroy, comme vous avez vu plus amplement cydessous.”

It is not the first time that the names _Jean de Mandeville_ and _Jean
à la Barbe_ are to be met with, as Ortelius, in his description of
Liège, included in his Itinerary of Belgium, has given the epitaph of
the knightly physician:[37(1)]

Dr. Warner writes in the _National Biography_:

“There is abundant proof that the tomb of the author of the _Travels_
was to be seen in the Church of the Guillemins or Guillelmites at
Liège down to the demolition of the building in 1798. The fact of his
burial there, with the date of his death, 17th November, 1372, was
published by Bale in 1548 (_Summarium_, f. 149 _b_), and was confirmed
independently by Jacob Meyer (_Annales rerum Flandric_., 1561, p. 165)
and Lud. Guicciardini. (_Paesi Bassi_, 1567, p. 281.)”

In a letter dated from Bodley’s Library, 17th March, 1884, to _The
Academy_, 12th April, 1884, No. 623, Mr. Edward B. Nicholson drew
attention to the abstract from Jean d’Outremeuse, and came to the
conclusion that the writer of Mandeville’s relation was a _profound
liar_, and that he was the Liège Professor of Medicine, John of
Burgundy or _à la Barbe_. He adds: “If, in the matter of literary
honesty, John a Beard was a bit of a knave, he was very certainly no
fool.”

On the other hand, M. Léopold Delisle,[38] has shown that two
manuscripts, Nouv. acq. franç. 4515 (Barrois, 24) and Nouv. acq. franç.
4516 (Barrois, 185), were part formerly of one volume copied in 1371 by
Raoulet of Orleans and given in the same year to King Charles V. by his
physician Gervaise Crestien, _viz._ one year before the death of the
so-called Mandeville; one of these manuscripts—now separate—contains
the Book of Jehan de Mandeville, the other one, a treatise of “la
preservacion de epidimie, minucion ou curacion d’icelle faite de
maistre Jehan de Bourgoigne, autrement dit à la Barbe, professeur en
médicine et cytoien du Liège,” in 1365. This bringing together is
certainly not fortuitous.

Sir Henry Yule traces thus the sources of the spurious work: “Even
in that part of the book which may be admitted with probability to
represent some genuine experience, there are distinct traces that
another work has been made use of, more or less, as an aid in the
compilation, we might almost say, as a framework to fill up. This is
the itinerary of the German knight William of Boldensele, written
in 1336 at the desire of Cardinal Talleyrand de Perigord. A cursory
comparison of this with Mandeville leaves no doubt of the fact that
the latter has followed its thread, using its suggestions, and on
many subjects its expressions, though digressing and expanding on
every side, and too often eliminating the singular good sense of the
German traveller. After such a comparison we may indicate as examples
Boldensele’s account of Cyprus (_Mandeville, Halliwell’s_ ed. 1866, p.
28, and p. 10), of Tyre and the coast of Palestine (_Mandeville_, 29,
30, 33, 34), of the journey from Gaza to Egypt (34), passages about
Babylon of Egypt (40), about Mecca (42), the general account of Egypt
(45), the pyramids (52), some of the particular wonders of Cairo, such
as the slave-market, the chicken-hatching stoves, and the apples of
Paradise, _i.e._ plantains (49), the Red Sea (57), the convent on Sinai
(58, 60), the account of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (74–76), etc.”

He adds: “It is curious that no passage in Mandeville can be plausibly
traced to Marco Polo, with one exception. This is (_Halliwell’s_
ed., p. 163) where he states that at Ormus the people, during the
great heat, lie in water,—a circumstance mentioned by Polo, though
not by Odoric. We should suppose it most likely that this fact had
been interpolated in the copy of Odoric used by Mandeville; for, if
he had borrowed it direct from Polo, he would have borrowed more.”
(_Encyclopædia Britannica_, p. 474.)

“Leaving this question, there remains the more complex one whether the
book contains, in any measure, facts and knowledge acquired by actual
travels and residence in the East. We believe that it may, but only as
a small portion of the whole, and that confined entirely to the section
of the work which treats of the Holy Land, and of the different ways
of getting thither, as well as of Egypt, and in general of what we
understand by the Levant.” (_Ibid._ p. 473.)

Dr. Warner deals the final blow in the _National Biography_: “The
alphabets which he gives have won him some credit as a linguist, but
only the Greek and the Hebrew (which were readily accessible) are what
they pretend to be, and that which he calls Saracen actually comes from
the _Cosmographia_ of Æthicus! His knowledge of Mohammedanism and its
Arabic formulæ impressed even Yule. He was, however, wholly indebted
for that information to the _Liber de Statu Saracenorum_ of William of
Tripoli (_circa_ 1270), as he was to the _Historiæ Orientis_ of Hetoum,
the Armenian (1307), for much of what he wrote about Egypt. In the last
case, indeed, he shows a rare sign of independence, for he does not,
with Hetoum, end his history of the sultanate about 1300, but carries
it onto the death of En-Násir (1341), and names two of his successors.
Although his statements about them are not historically accurate, this
fact and a few other details suggest that he may really have been in
Egypt, if not at Jerusalem, but the proportion of original matter is so
very far short of what might be expected that even this is extremely
doubtful.”

With this final quotation, we may take leave of John of Mandeville,
aliàs John a Beard.

[33] _Astley_ (iv. p. 620): “The next Traveller we meet with into
    _Tartary_, and the Eastern Countries, after _Marco Polo_, is Friar
    _Odoric_, of _Udin_ in Friuli, a _Cordelier_; who set-about the
    Year 1318, and at his Return the Relation of it was drawn-up,
    from his own Mouth, by Friar _William_ of _Solanga_, in 1330.
    _Ramusio_ has inserted it in _Italian_, in the second Volume of his
    Collection; as _Hakluyt_, in his Navigations, has done the _Latin_,
    with an _English_ Translation. This is a most superficial Relation,
    and full of _Lies_; such as People with the Heads of Beasts, and
    Valleys haunted with Spirits: In one of which he pretends to have
    entered, protected by the Sign of the Cross; yet fled for Fear,
    at the Sight of a Face that grinned at him. In short, though he
    relates some Things on the _Tartars_ and _Manci_ (as he writes
    _Manji_) which agree with _Polo’s_ Account; yet it seems plain,
    from the Names of Places and other Circumstances, that he never was
    in those Countries, but imposed on the Public the few Informations
    he had from others, mixed with the many Fictions of his own. He
    set out again for the East in 1331; but warned, it seems, by an
    Apparition a few Miles from _Padua_, he returned thither, and
    died.” And a final blow in the index: “_Oderic, Friar, Travels of_,

                    NOTES AND ADDENDA TO SIR HENRY
                    YULE’S EDITION, CONTAINING THE
                      RESULTS OF RECENT RESEARCH
                             AND DISCOVERY

                                PREFACE


There is no need of a long Preface to this small book. When the
third edition of the _Book of Ser Marco Polo_ was published in 1903,
criticism was lenient to the Editor of YULE’S grand work, and it was
highly satisfactory to me that such competent judges as Sir Aurel
STEIN and Sven HEDIN gave their approval to the remarks I made on
the itineraries followed in Central Asia by the celebrated Venetian
Traveller.

Nevertheless occasional remarks having been made by some of the
reviewers, proper notice was taken of them; moreover, it was impossible
to avoid some mistakes and omissions in a work including several
hundreds of pages. As years went on, extensive voyages were undertaken
by travellers like Sir Aurel STEIN, Sven HEDIN, PELLIOT, KOZLOV, and
others, who brought fresh and important information. I had myself
collected material from new works as they were issued and from old
works which had been neglected. In the mean time I had given a second
edition of _Cathay and the Way Thither_, having thus an opportunity to
explore old ground again and add new commentaries to the book.

All this material is embodied in the present volume which is to be
considered but as a supplementary volume of “Addenda” and “Corrigenda”
to the Book itself. I have gathered matter for a younger editor when
a fourth edition of the _Book of Ser Marco Polo_ is undertaken, age
preventing the present editor to entertain the hope to be able to do
the work himself.

To many who lent their aid have I to give my thanks: all are named in
the following pages, but I have special obligation to Sir Aurel STEIN,
to Dr. B. LAUFER, of Chicago, to Sir Richard TEMPLE, and to Prof. Paul
PELLIOT, of the College de France, Paris, who furnished me with some of
the more important notes. A paper by Prof. E. H. PARKER in the _Asiatic
Quarterly Review_ proved also of considerable help.

Introduction, p. _6_.

Speaking of Pashai, Sir Aurel Stein (_Geog. Journ._), referring to
the notes and memoranda brought home by the great Venetian traveller,
has the following remarks: “We have seen how accurately it reproduces
information about territories difficult of access at all times, and far
away from his own route. It appears to me quite impossible to believe
that such exact data, learned at the very beginning of the great
traveller’s long wanderings, could have been reproduced by him from
memory alone close on thirty years later when dictating his wonderful
story to Rusticiano during his captivity at Genoa. Here, anyhow, we
have definite proof of the use of those ‘notes and memoranda which he
had brought with him,’ and which, as Ramusio’s ‘Preface’ of 1553 tells
us (see Yule, _Marco Polo_, I., Introduction, p. _6_), Messer Marco,
while prisoner of war, was believed to have had sent to him by his
father from Venice. How grateful must geographer and historical student
alike feel for these precious materials having reached the illustrious
prisoner safely!”

Introduction, p. _10 n_.

                               KHAKHAN.

“Mr. Rockhill’s remarks about the title _Khakhan_ require
supplementing. Of course, the Turks did not use the term before 560
(552 was the exact year), because neither they nor their name ‘Turk’
had any self-assertive existence before then, and until that year they
were the ‘iron-working slaves’ of the Jou-jan. The Khakhan of those
last-named Tartars naturally would not allow the petty tribe of Turk to
usurp his exclusive and supreme title. But even a century and a half
before this, the ruler of the T’u-kuh-hun nomads had already borne the
title of Khakhan, which (the late Dr. Bretschneider agreed with me in
thinking) was originally of Tungusic and not of Turkish origin. The
T’u-kuh-hun were of the same race as the half-Mongol, half-Tungusic
Tobas, who ruled for two centuries over North China.... The title of
Khakhan, in various bastard forms, was during the tenth century used by
the Kings of Khoten and Kuche, as well as by the petty Ouigour Kings of
Kan Chou, Si Chou, etc.” (E. H. PARKER, _Asiatic Quart. Rev._, Jan.,
1904, pp. 139–140.)

Introduction, p. _19_. [The] second start [of the Venetians] from Acre
took place about November, 1271.

M. Langlois remarks that the last stay of the Polos at Acre was
necessarily before the 18th November, 1271, date of the departure of
Gregory X. for the West. Cf. _Itinéraires à Jérusalem et Descriptions
de la Terre-Sainte rédigés en français aux XIᵉ, XIIᵉ et XIIIᵉ siècles_,
publ. par H. MICHELANT et G. RAYNAUD (Genève, 1882), pp. xxviii–xxix:

“La date de 1269, donnée seulement par un des manuscrits de la
rédaction de Thibaut de Cépoy, pour le premier séjour à Acre des Polo
et leur rencontre avec Tedaldo Visconti, qui allait être élu pape et
prendre le nom de Grégoire X., date préférée par tous les éditeurs à
celles évidemment erronées de Rusticien de Pise (1260) et des huit
autres manuscrits de Thibaut de Cépoy (1250 et 1260), n’est pas hors
de toute discussion. M. G. Tononi, archiprêtre de Plaisance, qui
prépare une histoire et une édition des œuvres de Grégoire X., me fait
remarquer que les chroniqueurs ne placent le départ de Tedaldo pour la
Terre-Sainte qu’après celui de S. Louis pour Tunis (2 juillet 1270),
et que, d’après un acte du _Trésor des Chartes_, Tedaldo était encore
à Paris le 28 décembre 1269. Il faudrait donc probablement dater de
1271 le premier et le deuxième séjour des Polo à Acre, et les placer
tous deux entre le 9 mai, époque de l’arrivée en Terre-Sainte d’Edouard
d’Angleterre,—avec lequel, suivant _l’Eracles_, aborda Tedaldo—et le 18
novembre, date du départ du nouveau pape pour l’Occident.” (Cf. _Hist.
litt. de la France_, XXXV, _Marco Polo_.)

Introduction, p. _19 n_.

I have here discussed Major Sykes’ theory of Polo’s itinerary
in Persia; the question was raised again by Major Sykes in the
_Geographical Journal_, October, 1905, pp. 462–465. I answered again,
and I do not think it necessary to carry on farther this controversy.
I recall that Major Sykes writes: “To conclude, I maintain that Marco
Polo entered Persia near Tabriz, whence he travelled to Sultania,
Kashan, Yezd, Kerman, and Hormuz. From that port, owing to the
unseaworthiness of the vessels, the presence of pirates, the fact
that the season was past, or for some other reason, he returned by a
westerly route to Kerman, and thence crossed the Lut to Khorasan.”

I replied in the _Geographical Journal_, Dec., 1905, pp. 686–687:
“Baghdad, after its fall in 1258, did not cease immediately to be
‘rather off the main caravan route.’ I shall not refer Major Sykes
to what I say in my editions of ‘Odorico’ and ‘Polo’ on the subject,
but to the standard work of Heyd, _Commerce du Levant_, Vol. 2, pp.
77, 78. The itinerary, Tabriz, Sultania, Kashan, Yezd, was the usual
route later on, at the beginning of the fourteenth century, and it
was followed, among others, by Fra Odorico, of Pordenone. Marco Polo,
on his way to the Far East—you must not forget that he was at Acre
in 1271—could not have crossed Sultania, which _did not exist_, as
its building was commenced by Arghún Khan, who ascended the throne in
1284, and was continued by Oeljaitu (1304–1316), who gave the name
of Sultania to the city.” Cf. Lieut.-Col. P. M. SYKES, _A History of
Persia_, 1915, 2 vols., 8vo; II., p. 181 n.

Introduction, p. _21_. M. Pauthier has found a record in the Chinese
Annals of the Mongol dynasty, which states that in the year 1277,
a certain POLO was nominated a second-class commissioner or agent
attached to the Privy Council, a passage which we are happy to believe
to refer to our young traveller.

Prof. E. H. Parker remarks (_Asiatic Quart. Review_, 3rd Series, Vol.
XVII., Jan., 1904, pp. 128–131): “M. Pauthier has apparently overlooked
other records, which make it clear that the identical individual in
question had already received honours from Kúblái many years before
Marco’s arrival in 1275. Perhaps the best way to make this point
clear would be to give all the original passages which bear upon the
question. The number I give refer to the chapter and page (first half
or second half of the double page) of the _Yuan Shï_:—

A. Chap. 7, p. 1²⁄₂: 1270, second moon. Kúblái inspects a court pageant
prepared by Puh-lo and others.

B. Chap. 7, p. 6¹⁄₂: 1270, twelfth moon. The _yü-shï chung-ch’êng_
(censor) Puh-lo made also President of the _Ta-sz-nung_ department.
One of the ministers protested that there was no precedent for a
censor holding this second post. Kúblái insisted.

C. Chap. 8, p. 16¹⁄₂: 1275, second moon. Puh-lo and another sent to look
into the Customs taxation question in Tangut.

D. Chap. 8, p. 22¹⁄₂: 1275, fourth moon. The _Ta-sz-nung_ and _yü-shï
chung-ch’êng_ Puh-lo promoted to be _yü-shï ta-fu_.

E. Chap. 9, p. 11²⁄₂: 1276, seventh moon. The Imperial Prince Puh-lo
given a seal.

F. Chap. 9, p. 16²⁄₂: 1277, second moon. The _Ta-sz-nung_ and _yü-shï
ta-fu_, Puh-lo, being also _süan-wei-shï_ and Court Chamberlain,
promoted to be _shu-mih fu-shï_, and also _süan-hwei-shï_ and Court
Chamberlain.

“The words _shu-mih fu-shï_, the Chinese characters for which are given
on p. 569 of M. Cordier’s second volume, precisely mean ‘Second-class
Commissioner attached to the Privy Council,’ and hence it is clear that
Pauthier was totally mistaken in supposing the censor of 1270 to have
been Marco. Of course the Imperial Prince Puh-lo is not the same person
as the censor, nor is it clear who the (1) pageant and (2) Tangut
Puh-los were, except that neither could possibly have been Marco, who
only arrived in May—the third moon—at the very earliest.

“In the first moon of 1281 some gold, silver, and bank-notes were
handed to Puh-lo for the relief of the poor. In the second moon of
1282, just before the assassination of Achmed, the words ‘Puh-lo the
Minister’ (_ch’êng-siang_) are used in connection with a case of fraud.
In the seventh moon of 1282 (after the fall of Achmed) the ‘Mongol
man Puh-lo’ was placed in charge of some gold-washings in certain
towers of the then Hu Pêh (now in Hu Nan). In the ninth moon of the
same year a commission was sent to take official possession of all the
gold-yielding places in Yün Nan, and Puh-lo was appointed _darugachi_
(= governor) of the mines. In this case it is not explicitly stated
(though it would appear most likely) that the two gold superintendents
were the same man; if they were, then neither could have been Marco,
who certainly was no ‘Mongol man.’ Otherwise there would be a great
temptation to identify this event with the mission to ‘_una città,
detta Carazan_’ of the Ramusio Text.

“There is, however, one man who may possibly be Marco, and that is the
Poh-lo who was probably with Kúblái at Chagan Nor when the news of
Achmed’s murder by Wang Chu arrived there in the third moon of 1282.
The Emperor at once left for Shang-tu (_i.e._ _K’ai-p’ing Fu_, north
of Dolonor), and ‘ordered the _shu-mih fu-shï_ Poh-lo [with two other
statesmen] to proceed with all speed to Ta-tu (_i.e._ to Cambalu).
On receiving Poh-lo’s report, the Emperor became convinced of the
deceptions practised upon him by Achmed, and said: “It was a good thing
that Wang Chu _did_ kill him.”’ In 1284 Achmed’s successor is stated
(chap. 209, p. 9½) to have recommended Poh-lo, amongst others, for
minor Treasury posts. The same man (chap. 209, p. 12½) subsequently
got Poh-lo appointed to a salt superintendency in the provinces; and
as Yang-chou is the centre of the salt trade, it is just possible that
Marco’s ‘governorship’ of that place may resolve itself into this.

“There are many other Puh-lo and Poh-lo mentioned, both before Marco’s
arrival in, and subsequently to Marco’s departure in 1292 from, China.
In several cases (as, for instance, in that of P. Timur) both forms
occur in different chapters for the same man; and a certain Tartar
called ‘Puh-lan Hi’ is also called ‘Puh-lo Hi.’ One of Genghis Khan’s
younger brothers was called Puh-lo Kadei. There was, moreover, a
Cathayan named Puh-lo, and a Naiman Prince Poh-lo. Whether ‘Puh-lo the
Premier’ or ‘one of the Ministers,’ mentioned in 1282, is the same
person as ‘Poh-lo the _ts’an chêng_,’ or ‘Prime Minister’s assistant’
of 1284, I cannot say. Perhaps, when the whole _Yüan Shï_ has been
thoroughly searched throughout in all its editions, we may obtain more
certain information. Meanwhile, one thing is plain: Pauthier is wrong,
Yule is wrong in that particular connection; and M. Cordier gives us
no positive view of his own. The other possibilities are given above,
but I scarcely regard any of them as probabilities. On p. 99 of his
Introduction, Colonel Yule manifestly identifies the Poh-lo of 1282
with Marco; but the identity of his title with that of Puh-lo in 1277
suggests that the two men are one, in which case neither can be Marco
Polo. On p. 422 of vol. i. Yule repeats this identification in his
notes. I may mention that much of the information given in the present
article was published in Vol. XXIV. of the _China Review_ two or three
years ago. I notice that M. Cordier quotes that volume in connection
with other matters, but this particular point does not appear to have
caught his eye.

“As matters now stand, there is a fairly strong presumption that Marco
Polo is _once_ named in the Annals; but there is no irrefragable
evidence; and in any case it is only this once, and not as Pauthier has
it.”

Cf. also note by Prof. E. H. Parker, _China Review_, XXV. pp. 193–4,
and, according to Prof. Pelliot (_Bul. Ecole franç. Ext. Orient_,
July-Sept., 1904, p. 769), the biography of Han Lin-eul in the _Ming
shi_, k. 122, p. 3.

Prof. Pelliot writes to me: “Il faut renoncer une bonne fois à
retrouver Marco Polo dans le Po-lo mêlé à l’affaire d’Ahmed. Grâce
aux titulations successives, nous pouvons reconstituer la carrière
administrative de ce Po-lo, au moins depuis 1271, c’est-à-dire depuis
une date antérieure à l’arrivée de Marco Polo à la cour mongole.
D’autre part, Rashid-ud-Din mentionne le rôle joué dans l’affaire
d’Ahmed par le Pulad-aqa, c’est-à-dire Pulad Chinsang, son informateur
dans les choses mongoles, mais la forme mongole de ce nom de _Pulad_
est _Bolod_, en transcription chinoise _Po-lo_. J’ai signalé (_T’oung
Pao_, 1914, p. 640) que des textes chinois mentionnent effectivement
que Po-lo (Bolod), envoyé en mission auprès d’Arghún en 1285, resta
ensuite en Perse. C’est donc en définitive le Pulad (= Bolod) de
Rashid-ud-Din qui serait le Po-lo qu’à la suite de Pauthier on a trop
longtemps identifié à Marco Polo.”

Introduction, p. _23_.

“The _Yüan Shï_ contains curious confirmation of the facts which led
up to Marco Polo’s conducting a wife to Arghún of Persia, who lost his
spouse in 1286. In the eleventh moon of that year (say January, 1287)
the following laconic announcement appears: ‘T’a-ch’a-r Hu-nan ordered
to go on a mission to A-r-hun.’ It is possible that Tachar and Hunan
may be two individuals, and, though they probably started overland,
it is probable that they were in some way connected with Polo’s first
and unsuccessful attempt to take the girl to Persia.” (E. H. PARKER,

Introduction, p. _76 n_.

With regard to the statue of the Pseudo-Marco Polo of Canton, Dr. B.
Laufer, of Chicago, sends me the following valuable note:—

               THE ALLEGED MARCO POLO LO-HAN OF CANTON.

The temple _Hua lin se_ (in Cantonese _Fa lum se_, _i.e._ Temple of
the Flowery Grove) is situated in the western suburbs of the city of
Canton. Its principal attraction is the vast hall, the Lo-han t’ang,
in which are arranged in numerous avenues some five hundred richly
gilded images, about three feet in height, representing the 500 Lo-han
(Arhat). The workmanship displayed in the manufacture of these
figures, made of fine clay thickly covered with burnished gilding,
is said to be most artistic, and the variety of types is especially
noticeable. In this group we meet a statue credited with a European
influence. Two opinions are current regarding this statue: one refers
to it as representing the image of a Portuguese sailor, the other sees
in it a portrait of Marco Polo.

The former view is expressed, as far as I see, for the first time,
by MAYERS and DENNYS (_The Treaty Ports of China and Japan_, London
and Hong Kong, 1867, p. 162). “One effigy,” these authors remark,
“whose features are strongly European in type, will be pointed out
as the image of a Portuguese seaman who was wrecked, centuries ago,
on the coast, and whose virtues during a long residence gained him
canonization after death. This is probably a pure myth, growing from
an accidental resemblance of the features.” This interpretation of
a homage rendered to a Portuguese is repeated by C. A. MONTALTO DE
JESUS, _Historic Macao_ (Hong Kong, 1902, p. 28). A still more positive
judgment on this matter is passed by MADROLLE (_Chine du Sud et de
l’Est_, Paris, 1904, p. 17). “The attitudes of the Venerable Ones,” he
says, “are remarkable for their life-like expression, or sometimes,
singularly grotesque. One of these personalities placed on the right
side of a great altar wears the costume of the 16th century, and we
might be inclined to regard it as a Chinese representation of Marco
Polo. It is probable, however, that the artist, who had to execute
the statue of a Hindu, that is, of a man of the West, adopted as the
model of his costume that of the Portuguese who visited Canton since
the commencement of the 16th century.” It seems to be rather doubtful
whether the 500 Lo-han of Canton are really traceable to that time.
There is hardly any huge clay statue in China a hundred or two hundred
years old, and all the older ones are in a state of decay, owing to
the brittleness of the material and the carelessness of the monks.
Besides, as stated by Mayers and Dennys (_l.c._, p. 163), the Lo-han
Hall of Canton, with its glittering contents, is a purely modern
structure, having been added to the Fa-lum Temple in 1846, by means of
a subscription mainly supported by the Hong Merchants. Although this
statue is not old, yet it may have been made after an ancient model.
Archdeacon Gray, in his remarkable and interesting book, _Walks in the
City of Canton_ (Hong Kong, 1875, p. 207), justly criticized the Marco
Polo theory, and simultaneously gave a correct identification of the
Lo-han in question. His statement is as follows: “Of the idols of the
five hundred disciples of Buddha, which, in this hall, are contained,
there is one, which, in dress and configuration of countenance, is said
to resemble a foreigner. With regard to this image, one writer, if we
mistake not, has stated that it is a statue of the celebrated traveller
Marco Polo, who, in the thirteenth century, visited, and, for some
time, resided in the flowery land of China. This statement, on the part
of the writer to whom we refer, is altogether untenable. Moreover, it
is an error so glaring as to cast, in the estimation of all careful
readers of his work, no ordinary degree of discredit upon many of his
most positive assertions. The person, whose idol is so rashly described
as being that of Marco Polo, was named Shien-Tchu. He was a native of
one of the northern provinces of India, and, for his zeal as an apostle
in the service of Buddha, was highly renowned.”

Everard Cotes closes the final chapter of his book, _The Arising East_
(New York, 1907), as follows: “In the heart of Canton, within easy
reach of mob violence at any time, may be seen to-day the life-size
statue of an elderly European, in gilt clothes and black hat, which
the Chinese have cared for and preserved from generation to generation
because the original, Marco Polo, was a friend to their race. The
thirteenth-century European had no monopoly of ability to make himself
loved and reverenced. A position similar to that which he won as
an individual is open to-day to the Anglo-Saxon as a race. But the
Mongolian was not afraid of Marco Polo, and he is afraid of us. It can
be attained, therefore, only by fair dealing and sympathy, supported by
an overwhelming preponderance of fighting strength.”

[Dr. Laufer reproduces here the note in _Marco Polo_, I., p. _76_. I
may remark that I never said nor believed that the statue was Polo’s.
The mosaic at Genoa is a fancy portrait.]

The question may be raised, however, Are there any traces of foreign
influence displayed in this statue? The only way of solving this
problem seemed to me the following: First to determine the number
and the name of the alleged Marco Polo Lo-han at Canton, and then by
means of this number to trace him in the series of pictures of the
traditional 500 Lo-han (the so-called _Lo han t’u_).

The alleged Marco Polo Lo-han bears the number 100, and his name
is Shan-chu tsun-che (_tsun-che_ being a translation of Sanskrit
_ārya_, “holy, reverend”). The name Shan-chu evidently represents the
rendering of a Sanskrit name, and does not suggest a European name.
The illustration here reproduced is Lo-han No. 100 from a series of
stone-engravings in the temple T’ien-ning on the West Lake near Hang
Chau. It will be noticed that it agrees very well with the statue
figured by M. Cordier. In every respect it bears the features of an
Indian Lo-han, with one exception, and this is the curious hat. This,
in fact, is the only Lo-han among the five hundred that is equipped
with a headgear; and the hat, as is well known, is not found in India.
This hat must represent a more or less arbitrary addition of the
Chinese artist who created the group, and it is this hat which led
to the speculations regarding the Portuguese sailor or Marco Polo.
Certain it is also that such a type of hat does not occur in China;
but it seems idle to speculate as to its origin, as long as we have
no positive information on the intentions of the artist. The striped
mantle of the Lo-han is by no means singular, for it occurs with
seventeen others. The facts simply amount to this, that the figure in
question does not represent a Portuguese sailor or Marco Polo or any
other European, but solely an Indian Lo-han (Arhat), while the peculiar
hat remains to be explained.

                          THIBAUT DE CHEPOY.

Thibaut de Chepoy (Chepoy, canton of Breteuil, Oise), son of the knight
Jean de Chepoy, was one of the chief captains of King Philip the
Fair. He entered the king’s service in 1285 as squire and valet; went
subsequently to Robert d’Artois, who placed him in charge of the castle
of Saint Omer, and took him, in 1296, to Gascony to fight the English.
He was afterwards grand master of the cross-bow men. He then entered
the service of Charles de Valois, brother of Philip the Fair, who sent
him to Constantinople to support the claims to the throne of his wife,
Catherine of Courtenay. Thibaut left Paris on the 9th Sept., 1306,
passed through Venice, where he met Marco Polo who gave him a copy of
his manuscript. Thibaut died between 22nd May, 1311, and 22nd March,
1312. (See Joseph PETIT, in _Le Moyen Age_, Paris, 1897, pp. 224–239.)

Prof. Pelliot writes to me: “Il n’y a aucune possibilité de retrouver
dans _Saracanco, Sarai + Ḳúnk_. Le mot _Ḳúnk_ n’est pas autrement
attesté, et la construction mongole ou turque exigerait _ḳunḳ-sarai_.”

to me that we do not know _any_ k’itan inscription, but half a dozen
characters reproduced in a work of the second half of the fourteenth
century. The Uíghúr alphabet is of Aramean origin through Sogdian; from
this point of view, it is not necessary to call for Estranghelo, nor
Nestorian propaganda. On the other hand we have to-day documents in
Uíghúr writing older than the _Kudatku Bilik_.

In the French text we have _nassit_ and _nac_.

“S’il faut en croire M. Defrémery, au lieu de _nassit_, il faut
évidemment lire _nassij_ (nécidj), ce qui signifie un tissu, en
général, et désigne particulièrement une étoffe de soie de la même
espèce que le _nekh_. Quant aux étoffes sur lesquelles étaient figurés
des animaux et des oiseaux, le même orientaliste croit qu’il faut y
reconnaître le _thardwehch_, sorte d’étoffe de soie qui, comme son nom
l’indique, représentait des scènes de chasse. On sait que l’usage de
ces représentations est très ancien en Orient, comme on le voit dans

Francisque-Michel (I., p. 316) remarks: “De ce que Marco Polo se
borne à nommer Tauris comme la ville de Perse où il se fabriquait
maints draps d’or et de soie, il ne faudrait pas en conclure que cette
industrie n’existât pas sur d’autres points du même royaume. Pour n’en
citer qu’un seul, la ville d’Arsacie, ancienne capitale des Parthes,
connue aujourd’hui sous le nom de Caswin, possédait vraisemblablement
déjà cette industrie des beaux draps d’or et de soie qui existait
encore au temps de Huet, c’est-à-dire au XVIIᵉ siècle.”

XIII., p. 78. “Messer Marco Polo found a village there which goes by
the name of CALA ATAPERISTAN, which is as much as to say, ‘The Castle
of the Fire-worshippers.’”

With regard to Kal’ah-i Atashparastān, Prof. A. V. W. Jackson writes
(_Persia_, 1906, p. 413): “And the name is rightly applied, for the
people there do worship fire. In an article entitled _The Magi in Marco
Polo (Journ. Am. Or. Soc._, 26, 79–83) I have given various reasons for
identifying the so-called ‘Castle of the Fire-Worshippers’ with Kashan,
which Odoric mentions or a village in its vicinity, the only rival to
the claim being the town of Naïn, whose Gabar Castle has already been
mentioned above.”

Speaking of Saba and of Cala Ataperistan, Prof. E. H. Parker (_Asiatic
Quart. Rev._, Jan., 1904, p. 134) has the following remarks: “It is not
impossible that certain unexplained statements in the Chinese records
may shed light upon this obscure subject. In describing the Arab
Conquest of Persia, the Old and New T’ang Histories mention the city of
Hia-lah as being amongst those captured; another name for it was _Sam_
(according to the Chinese initial and final system of spelling words).
A later Chinese poet has left the following curious line on record:
‘All the priests venerate Hia-lah.’ The allusion is vague and undated,
but it is difficult to imagine to what else it can refer. The term
_sêng_, or ‘bonze,’ here translated ‘priests,’ was frequently applied
to Nestorian and Persian priests, as in this case.”

Regarding the legend of the stone cast into a well, cf. F. W. K.
MÜLLER, _Uigurica_, pp. 5–10 (Pelliot).

XVII., p. 90. “There are also plenty of veins of steel and _Ondanique_.”

“The _ondanique_ which Marco Polo mentions in his 42nd chapter is
almost certainly the _pin t’ieh_ or ‘pin iron’ of the Chinese, who
frequently mention it as coming from Arabia, Persia, Cophene, Hami,
Ouigour-land and other High Asia States.” (E. H. PARKER, _Journ. North
China Br. Roy. Asiatic Soc._, XXXVIII., 1907, p. 225.)

XVIII., pp. 97, 100. “The province that we now enter is called
REOBARLES.... The beasts also are peculiar.... Then there are sheep
here as big as asses; and their tails are so large and fat, that one
tail shall weight some 30 lbs. They are fine fat beasts, and afford
capital mutton.”

Prof. E. H. PARKER writes in the _Journ. of the North China Branch
of the Royal Asiatic Soc._, XXXVII., 1906, p. 196: “Touching the
fat-tailed sheep of Persia, the _Shan-haï-king_ says the Yuëh-chï or
Indo-Scythy had a ‘big-tailed sheep,’ the correct name for which is
_hien-yang_. The Sung History mentions sheep at Hami with tails so
heavy that they could not walk. In the year 1010 some were sent as
tribute to China by the King of Kuché.”

“Among the native products [at Mu lan p’i, Murābit, Southern Coast of
Spain] are foreign sheep, which are several feet high and have tails as
big as a fan. In the spring-time they slit open their bellies and take
out some tens of catties of fat, after which they sew them up again,
and the sheep live on; if the fat were not removed, (the animal) would
swell up and die.” (CHAU JU-KWA, pp. 142–3.)

“The Chinese of the T’ang period had heard also of the trucks put
under these sheep’s tails. ‘The Ta-shï have a foreign breed of sheep
(_hu-yang_) whose tails, covered with fine wool, weigh from ten to
twenty catties; the people have to put carts under them to hold them
up. Fan-kuo-chï as quoted in Tung-si-yang-k’au.” (HIRTH and ROCKHILL,
p. 143.)

Leo Africanus, _Historie of Africa_, III., 945 (Hakluyt Soc. ed.), says
he saw in Egypt a ram with a tail weighing eighty pounds!:

                         OF THE AFRICAN RAMME.

“There is no difference betweene these rammes of Africa and others,
saue onely in their tailes, which are of a great thicknes, being by so
much the grosser, but how much they are more fatte, so that some of
their tailes waigh tenne, and other twentie pounds a peece, and they
become fatte of their owne naturall inclination: but in Egypt there
are diuers that feede them fatte with bran and barly, vntill their
tailes growe so bigge that they cannot remooue themselves from place to
place: insomuch that those which take charge of them are faine to binde
little carts vnder their tailes, to the end they may haue strength to
walke. I my selfe saw at a citie in Egypt called Asiot, and standing
vpon Nilus, about an hundred and fiftie miles from Cairo, one of the
saide rams tailes that weighed fowerscore pounds, and others affirmed
that they had seene one of those tailes of an hundred and fiftie pounds
weight. All the fatte therefore of this beast consisteth in his taile;
neither is there any of them to be founde but onely in Tunis and in
Egypt.” (LEO AFRICANUS, edited by Dr. Robert BROWN, III., 1896, Hakluyt
Society, p. 945.)

XVIII., pp. 97, 100 n.

Dr. B. Laufer draws my attention to what is probably the oldest mention
of this sheep from Arabia, in Herodotus, Book III., Chap. 113:

“Concerning the spices of Arabia let no more be said. The whole country
is scented with them, and exhales an odour marvellously sweet. There
are also in Arabia two kinds of sheep worthy of admiration, the like
of which is nowhere else to be seen; the one kind has long tails, not
less than three cubits in length, which, if they were allowed to trail
on the ground, would be bruised and fall into sores. As it is, all the
shepherds know enough of carpentering to make little trucks for their
sheep’s tails. The trucks are placed under the tails, each sheep having
one to himself, and the tails are then tied down upon them. The other
kind has a broad tail, which is a cubit across sometimes.”

Canon G. Rawlinson, in his edition of Herodotus, has the following note
on this subject (II., p. 500):—

“Sheep of this character have acquired among our writers the name of
Cape Sheep, from the fact that they are the species chiefly affected by
our settlers at the Cape of Good Hope. They are common in Africa and
throughout the East, being found not only in Arabia, but in Persia,
Syria, Affghanistan, Egypt, Barbary, and even Asia Minor. A recent
traveller, writing from Smyrna, says: ‘The sheep of the country are the
Cape sheep, having a kind of apron tail, entirely of rich marrowy fat,
extending to the width of their hind quarters, and frequently trailing
on the ground; the weight of the tail is often more than six or eight
pounds’ (FELLOWS’S _Asia Minor_, p. 10). Leo Africanus, writing in the
15th century, regards the broad tail as the great difference between
the sheep of Africa and that of Europe. He declares that one which _he
had seen_ in Egypt weighed 80 lbs. He also mentions the use of trucks
which is still common in North Africa.”

XVIII., p. 98. “Camadi.—Reobarles.—In this plain there are a number of
villages and towns which have lofty walls of mud, made as a defence
against the banditti, who are very numerous, and are called CARAONAS.
This name is given them because they are the sons of Indian mothers by
Tartar fathers.”

Mirzá Haïdar writes (_Tárikh-i-Rashidi_, p. 148): “The learned Mirzá
Ulugh Beg has written a history which he has called _Ulus Arbaa_. One
of the ‘four hordes’ is that of the Moghul, who are divided into two
branches, the Moghul and the Chaghatái. But these two branches, on
account of their mutual enmity, used to call each other by a special
name, by way of depreciation. Thus the Chaghatái called the Moghul
_Jatah_, while the Moghul called the Chaghatái _Karáwánás_.”

Cf. Ney ELIAS, _l.c._, pp. 76–77, and App. B, pp. 491–2, containing an
inquiry made in Khorasán by Mr. Maula Bakhsh, Attaché at the Meshed
Consulate General, of the families of Kárnás, he has heard or seen; he
says: “These people speak Turki now, and are considered part of the
Goklán Turkomans. They, however, say they are Chingiz-Kháni Moghuls,
and are no doubt the descendants of the same Kárnás, or Karávanás, who
took such a prominent part in the victories in Persia.

“The word Kárnás, I was told by a learned Goklan Mullah, means
_Tirandáz_, or _Shikári_ (_i.e._ Archer or Hunter), and was applied
to this tribe of Moghuls on account of their professional skill in
shooting, which apparently secured them an important place in the
army. In Turki the word Kárnás means _Shikamparast_—literally, ‘belly
worshippers,’ which implies avarice. This term is in use at present,
and I was told, by a Kázi of Bujnurd, that it is sometimes used by way
of reproach.... The Kárnás people in Mána and Gurgán say it is the name
of their tribe, and they can give no other explanation.”

XVIII., pp. 98, 102, 165. “The King of these scoundrels is called
NOGODAR.”

Sir Aurel Stein has the following regarding the route taken by this
Chief in _Serindia_, I., pp. 11–12:—

“To revert to an earlier period it is noteworthy that the route in
Marco Polo’s account, by which the Mongol partisan leader Nigūdar,
‘with a great body of horsemen, cruel unscrupulous fellows,’ made his
way from Badakhshān ‘through another province called PASHAI-DIR, and
then through another called ARIORA-KESHEMUR’ to India, must have led
down the Bashgol Valley. The name of _Pashai_ clearly refers to the
Kāfirs among whom this tribal designation exists to this day, while the
mention of Dīr indicates the direction which this remarkable inroad had
taken. That its further progress must have lain through Swāt is made
probable by the name which, in Marco Polo’s account, precedes that of
‘Keshemur’ or Kashmīr; for in the hitherto unexplained _Ariora_ can be
recognized, I believe, the present Agrōr, the name of the well-known
hill-tract on the Hazāra border which faces Bunēr from the left bank of
the Indus. It is easy to see from any accurate map of these regions,
that for a mobile column of horsemen forcing its way from Badakhshān
to Kashmīr, the route leading through the Bashgol Valley, Dīr, Talāsh,
Swāt, Bunēr, Agrōr, and up the Jhelam Valley, would form at the present
day, too, the most direct and practicable line of invasion.”

In a paper on _Marco Polo’s Account of a Mongol inroad into Kashmir_
(_Geog. Jour._, August, 1919), Sir Aurel Stein reverts again to the
same subject. “These [Mongol] inroads appear to have commenced from
about 1260 A.D., and to have continued right through the reign of
Ghiasuddin, Sultan of Delhi (1266–1286), whose identity with Marco’s
_Asedin Soldan_ is certain. It appears very probable that Marco’s story
of Nogodar, the nephew of Chaghatái, relates to one of the earliest of
these incursions which was recent history when the Poli passed through
Persia about 1272–73 A.D.”

Stein thinks, with Marsden and Yule, that _Dilivar_ (pp. 99, 105) is
really a misunderstanding of “_Città_ di Livar” for _Lahawar_ or Lahore.

_Dir_ has been dealt with by Yule and Pauthier, and we know that it is
“the mountain tract at the head of the western branch of the Panjkora
River, through which leads the most frequented route from Peshawar and
the lower Swāt valley to Chītral” (Stein, _l.c._). Now with regard to
the situation of _Pashai_ (p. 104):

“It is clear that a safe identification of the territory intended
cannot be based upon such characteristics of its people as Marco
Polo’s account here notes obviously from hearsay, but must reckon
in the first place with the plainly stated bearing and distance. And
Sir Henry Yule’s difficulty arose just from the fact that what the
information accessible to him seemed to show about the location of the
name _Pashai_ could not be satisfactorily reconciled with those plain
topographical data. Marco’s great commentator, thoroughly familiar as
he was with whatever was known in his time about the geography of the
western Hindukush and the regions between Oxus and Indus, could not
fail to recognize the obvious connection between our _Pashai_ and the
tribal name _Pashai_ borne by Muhammanized Kafirs who are repeatedly
mentioned in mediæval and modern accounts of Kabul territory. But all
these accounts seemed to place the Pashais in the vicinity of the great
Panjshir valley, north-east of Kabul, through which passes one of the
best-known routes from the Afghan capital to the Hindukush watershed
and thence to the Middle Oxus. Panjshir, like Kabul itself, lies to the
_south-west_ of Badakshān, and it is just this discrepancy of bearing
together with one in the distance reckoned to Kashmir which caused Sir
Henry Yule to give expression to doubts when summing up his views about
Nogodar’s route.”

From Sir George Grierson’s _Linguistic Survey of India_ we learn that
to the south of the range of the Hindukush “the languages spoken from
Kashmir in the east to Kafiristan in the west are neither of Indian
nor of Iranian origin, but form a third branch of the Aryan stock of
the great Indo-European language family. Among the languages of this
branch, now rightly designated as ‘Dardic,’ the Kafir group holds a
very prominent place. In the Kafir group again we find the _Pashai_
language spoken over a very considerable area. The map accompanying Sir
George Grierson’s monograph on ‘The Pisaca Languages of North-Western
India’ [Asiatic Society Monographs, VIII., 1906], shows _Pashai_ as the
language spoken along the right bank of the Kunar river as far as the
Asmar tract as well as in the side valleys which from the north descend
towards it and the Kabul river further west. This important fact makes
it certain that the tribal designation of Pashai, to which this Kafir
language owes its name, has to this day an application extending much
further east than was indicated by the references which travellers,
mediæval and modern, along the Panjshir route have made to the Pashais
and from which alone this ethnic name was previously known.”

Stein comes to the conclusion that “the Mongols’ route led across the
Mandal Pass into the great Kafir valley of Bashgol and thus down to
Arnawai on the Kunar. Thence Dir could be gained directly across the
Zakhanna Pass, a single day’s march. There were alternative routes,
too, available to the same destination either by ascending the Kunar to
Ashreth and taking the present ‘Chitral Road’ across the Lowarai, or
descending the river to Asmar and crossing the Binshi Pass.”

From Dir towards Kashmir for a large body of horsemen “the easiest
and in matter of time nearest route must have led them as now down
the Panjkora Valley and beyond through the open tracts of Lower Swāt
and Buner to the Indus about Amb. From there it was easy through
the open northern part of the present Hazara District (the ancient
Urasa) to gain the valley of the Jhelam River at its sharp bend near
Muzzaffarabad.”

The name of _Agror_ (the direct phonetic derivative of the Sanskrit
_Atyugrapura_) = _Ariora_; it is the name of the hill-tract on the
Hazara border which faces Buner on the east from across the left bank
of the Indus.

Prof. E. H. Parker says that the T’ang History, in treating of the Arab

their horses on dried fish, and themselves subsist on the _hu-mang_, or
Persian date, as Bretschneider has explained.” (_Asiatic Quart. Rev._,

to the dates writes: “_Wan nien tsao_, ‘ten thousand years’ jujubes’;
called also _Po-sze tao_, or ‘Persian jujubes.’ These names and
others were applied since the time of the T’ang dynasty to the dates
brought from Persia. The author of the _Pen ts’ao kang mu_ (end of the
sixteenth century) states that this fruit is called _k’u-lu-ma_ in
Persia. The Persian name of the date is _khurma_.”

                              TUN-O-KAIN.

Major Sykes had adopted Sir Henry Yule’s theory of the route from
Kuh-benan to Tun. He has since altered his opinion in the _Geographical
Journal_, October, 1905, p. 465: “I was under the impression that
a route ran direct from Kubunán to Tabas, but when visiting this
latter town a few months ago I made careful inquiries on the subject,
which elicited the fact that this was not the case, and that the
route invariably followed by Kubunán-Tabas caravans joined the
Kermán-Rávar-Naiband route at Cháh-Kuru, 12 miles south of Darbana.
It follows this track as far as Naiband, whence the route to Tabas
branches off; but the main caravan route runs _viâ_ Zenagan and Duhuk
to Tun. This new information, I would urge, makes it almost certain
that Ser Marco travelled to Tun, as Tabas falls to the west of the main
route. Another point is that the district of Tabas only grows four
months’ supplies, and is, in consequence, generally avoided by caravans
owing to its dearness.

“In 1893 I travelled from Tun to the south across the Lut as far as
Cháh Kuru by this very route, and can testify to the general accuracy
of Ser Marco’s description,[1] although there are now villages at
various points on the way. Finally, as our traveller especially
mentions Tonocain, or Tun va Kain, one is inclined to accept this as
evidence of first-rate importance, especially as it is now corroborated
by the information I gained at Tabas. The whole question, once again,
furnishes an example of how very difficult it is to make satisfactory
inquiries, except on the spot.”

It was also the opinion (1882) of Colonel C. E. Stewart, who says: “I
was much interested in hearing of Kuh Banan, as it is one of the places
mentioned by Marco Polo as on his route. Kuh Banan is described as a
group of villages about 26 miles from the town of Rawar, in the Kárman
district. I cannot help thinking the road travelled by Marco Polo from
Kárman to Kain is the one by Naiband. Marco Polo speaks of Tun-o-Cain,
which, Colonel Yule has pointed out, undoubtedly means Tun and Kain.
At present Tun does not belong to the Kain district, but to the Tabbas
district, and is always spoken of as Tun-o-Tabbas; and if it belonged,
as I believe it formerly did, to the Kain district, it would be spoken
of as Tun-o-Kain, exactly as Marco Polo does. Through Naiband is the
shortest and best road to either Tun or Kain.” (_Proc. Royal Geog.
Soc._, VIII., 1886, p. 144.)

Support to Yule’s theory has been brought by Sven Hedin, who devotes
a chapter to Marco Polo in his _Overland to India_, II., 1910, Chap.
XL., and discusses our traveller’s route between Kuh-benan and Tabbas,
pp. 71 _seq._:

“As even Sykes, who travelled during several years through Persia in
all directions, cannot decide with full certainty whether Marco Polo
travelled by the western route through Tebbes or the eastern through
Naibend, it is easy to see how difficult it is to choose between the
two roads. I cannot cite the reasons Sir Henry Yule brings forward in
favour of the western route—it would take us too far. I will, instead,
set forth the grounds of my own conviction that Marco Polo used the
direct caravan road between Kuh-benan and Tebbes.

“The circumstance that the main road runs through Naibend is no proof,
for we find that Marco Polo, not only in Persia but also in Central
Asia, exhibited a sovereign contempt for all routes that might be
called convenient and secure.

“The distance between Kerman and Kuh-benan in a direct line amounts to
103 miles. Marco Polo travelled over this stretch in seven days, or
barely 15 miles a day. From Kuh-benan to Tebbes the distance is 150
miles, or fully 18 miles a day for eight days. From Kuh-benan _viâ_
Naibend to Tun, the distance is, on the other hand, 205 miles, or more
than 25 miles a day. In either case we can perceive from the forced
marches that after leaving Kuh-benan he came out into a country where
the distances between the wells became much greater.

“If he travelled by the eastern route he must have made much longer
day’s journeys than on the western. On the eastern route the distances
between the wells were greater. Major Sykes has himself travelled this
way, and from his detailed description we get the impression that it
presented particular difficulties. With a horse it is no great feat
to ride 25 miles a day for eight days, but it cannot be done with
camels. That I rode 42½ miles a day between Hauz-i-Haji-Ramazan and
Sadfe was because of the danger from rain in the Kevir, and to continue
such a forced march for more than two days is scarcely conceivable.
Undoubtedly Marco Polo used camels on his long journeys in Eastern
Persia, and even if he had been able to cover 205 miles in eight days,
he would not be obliged to do so, for on the main road through Naibend
and Duhuk to Tun there are abundant opportunities of procuring water.
Had he travelled through Naibend, he would in any case have had no need
to hurry on so fast. He would probably keep to the same pace as on
the way from Kerman to Kuh-benan, and this length he accomplished in
seven days. Why should he have made the journey from Kuh-benan to Tun,
which is exactly double as far, in only eight days instead of fourteen,
when there was no necessity? And that he actually travelled between
Kuh-benan and Tunocain in eight days is evident, because he mentions
this number twice.

“He also says explicitly that during these eight days neither fruits
nor trees are to be seen, and that you have to carry both food and
water. This description is not true of the Naibend route, for in
Naibend there are excellent water, fine dates, and other fruits. Then
there is Duhuk, which, according to Sykes, is a very important village
with an old fort and about 200 houses. After leaving Duhuk for the
south, Sykes says: ‘We continued our journey, and were delighted to
hear that at the next stage, too, there was a village, proving that
this section of the Lut is really quite thickly populated.’ [_Ten
Thousand Miles in Persia_, p. 35.] This does not agree at all with
Marco Polo’s description.

“I therefore consider it more probable that Marco Polo, as Sir Henry
Yule supposes, travelled either direct to Tebbes, or perhaps made
a trifling détour to the west, through the moderate-sized village
Bahabad, for from this village a direct caravan road runs to Tebbes,
entirely through desert. Marco Polo would then travel 150 miles in
eight days compared with 103 miles in seven days between Kerman and
Kuh-benan. He therefore increased his speed by only 4 miles a day, and
that is all necessary on the route in question.

“Bahabad lies at a distance of 36 miles from Kubenan—all in a straight
line. And not till beyond Bahabad does the real desert begin.

“To show that a caravan road actually connects Tebbes with Bahabad, I
have inserted in the first and second columns of the following table
the data I obtained in Tebbes and Fahanunch, and in the third the names
marked on the ‘Map of Persia (in six sheets) compiled in the Simla
Drawing Office of the Survey of India, 1897.’

“These details are drawn from different authorities, but are in
excellent agreement. That the total distances are different in the
first two columns is because Fahanunch lies nearer than Tebbes to
Bahabad. Two or three discrepancies in the names are of no importance.
Burch denotes a castle or fort; Belucha is evidently Cha-i-beluch or
the well of the Baluchi, and it is very probable that a small fort was
built some time or other at this well which was visited by raiders from
Baluchistan. Ser-i-julge and Kheirabad may be two distinct camping
grounds very near each other. The Chasma Sufid or ‘white spring’ of the
English map is evidently the same place as Sefid-ab, or ‘white water.’
Its God Hashtaki is a corruption of the Persian God-i-shah-taghi, or
the ‘hollow of the royal saxaul.’ Khudafrin, on the other hand, is
very apocryphal. It is no doubt Khuda-aferin or ‘God be praised!’—an
ejaculation very appropriate in the mouth of a man who comes upon a
sweet spring in the midst of the desert. If an Englishman travelled
this way he might have mistaken this ejaculation for the name of the
place. But then ‘Unsurveyed’ would hardly be placed just in this part
of the Bahabad Desert.

“The information I obtained about the road from Tebbes to Bahabad was
certainly very scanty, but also of great interest. Immediately beyond
Kurit the road crosses a strip of the Kevir, 2 farsakh broad, and
containing a river-bed which is said to be filled with water at the end
of February. Sefid-ab is situated among hillocks and Burch in an upland
district; to the south of it follows Kevir barely a farsakh broad,
which may be avoided by a circuitous path. At God-i-shah-taghi, as the
name implies, saxaul grows (_Haloxylon Ammodendron_). The last three
halting-places before Bahabad all lie among small hills.

“This desert route runs, then, through comparatively hilly country,
crosses two small Kevir depressions, or offshoots of one and the
same Kevir, has pasturage at at least one place, and presents no
difficulties of any account. The distance in a direct line is 113
miles, corresponding to 51 Persian farsakh—the farsakh in this district
being only about 2·2 miles long against 2·9 in the great Kevir. The
caravans which go through the Bahabad desert usually make the journey
in ten days, one at least of which is a rest day, so that they cover
little more than 12 miles a day. If water more or less salt were not to
be found at all the eight camping-grounds, the caravans would not be
able to make such short marches. It is also quite possible that sweet
water is to be found in one place; where saxaul grows driftsand usually
occurs, and wells digged in sand are usually sweet.

“During my stay in Tebbes a caravan of about 300 camels, as I have
mentioned before, arrived from Sebsevar. They were laden with _naft_
(petroleum), and remained waiting till the first belt of Kevir was
dried after the last rain. As soon as this happened the caravan would
take the road described above to Bahabad, and thence to Yezd. And this
caravan route, Sebsevar, Turshiz, Bajistan, Tun, Tebbes, Bahabad, and
Yezd, is considered less risky than the somewhat shorter way through
the great Kevir. I myself crossed a part of the Bahabad desert where we
did not once follow any of the roads used by caravans, and I found this
country by no means one of the worst in Eastern Persia.

“In the above exposition I believe that I have demonstrated that it is
extremely probable that Marco Polo travelled, not through Naibend to
Tun, but through Bahabad to Tebbes, and thence to Tun and Kain. His
own description accords in all respects with the present aspect and
peculiarities of the desert route in question. And the time of eight
days he assigns to the journey between Kuh-benan and Tonocain renders
it also probable that he came to the last-named province at Tebbes,
even if he travelled somewhat faster than caravans are wont to do at
the present day. It signifies little that he does not mention the name
Tebbes; he gives only the name of the province, adding that it contains
a great many towns and villages. One of these was Tebbes.”

XXII., p. 126.

                                TUTIA.

“It seems that the word is ‘the Arabicized word _dúdhá_, being
Persian for “smokes.”’ There can be little doubt that we have direct
confirmation of this in the Chinese words _t’ou-t’ieh_ (still, I
think, in use) and _t’ou-shih_, meaning ‘_tou_-iron’ and ‘_t’ou_-ore.’
The character _T’ou_ 鍮 does not appear in the old dictionaries; its
first appearance is in the History of the Toba (Tungusic) Dynasty of
North China. This History first mentions the name ‘Persia’ in A.D.
455 and the existence there of this metal, which, a little later on,
is also said to come from a State in the Cashmeer region. K’ang-hi’s
seventeenth-century dictionary is more explicit: it states that Termed
produces this ore, but that ‘the true sort comes from Persia, and looks
like gold, but on being heated it turns carnation, and _not_ black.’
As the Toba Emperors added 1000 new characters to the Chinese stock,
we may assume this one to have been invented, for the specific purpose
indicated.’” (E. H. PARKER, _Asiatic Quart. Rev._, Jan., 1904, pp.
135–6.) Prof. Parker adds the following note, _l.c._, p. 149: “Since
writing the above, I have come across a passage in the ‘History of
the Sung Dynasty’ (chap. 490, p. 17) stating that an Arab junk-master
brought to Canton in A.D. 990, and sent on thence to the Chinese
Emperor in Ho Nan, ‘one vitreous bottle of _tutia_.’ The two words
mean ‘metropolis-father,’ and are therefore without any signification,
except as a foreign word. According to Yule’s notes (I., p. 126),
_tútiá_, or _dudhá_, in one of its forms was used as an eye-ointment or
collyrium.”

XXII., pp. 127–139. The Province of Tonocain “contains an immense plain
on which is found the ARBRE SOL, which we Christians call the _Arbre
Sec_; and I will tell you what it is like. It is a tall and thick tree,
having the bark on one side green and the other white; and it produces
a rough husk like that of a chestnut, but without anything in it. The
wood is yellow like box, and very strong, and there are no other trees
near it nor within a hundred miles of it, except on one side, where you
find trees within about ten miles distance.”

In a paper published in the _Journal of the R. As. Soc._, Jan., 1909,
Gen. Houtum-Schindler comes to the conclusion, p. 157, that Marco
Polo’s tree is not the “Sun Tree,” but the Cypress of Zoroaster; “Marco
Polo’s _arbre sol_ and _arbre seul_ stand for the Persian _dirakht i
sol_, _i.e._ the cypress-tree.” If General Houtum Schindler had seen the
third edition of the _Book of Ser Marco Polo_, I., p. 113, he would
have found that I read his paper of the _J. R. A. S._, of January,
1898.”

Mr. T. B. CLARKE-THORNHILL wrote to me in 1906: “Though I can hardly
imagine that there can be any connection between the Caroline Islands
and the ‘Amiral d’Outre l’Arbre Sec,’ still it may interest you to know
that the currency of ‘millstones’ existed up to a short time ago, and
may do so still, in the island of Yap, in that group. It consisted of
various-sized discs of quartz from about 6 inches to nearly 3 feet in
diameter, and from ½ an inch to 3 or 4 inches in thickness.”

                       OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN.

Regarding the reduction of the Ismaelites, the _Yuän Shï_ tells us that
in 1222, on his way back after the taking of Nishapur, Tuli, son of
Genghis, plundered the State of Mu-la-i, captured Herat, and joined his
father at Talecan. In 1229 the King of Mu-lei presented himself at the
Mongol Court.... The following statement is also found in the Mongol
Annals: “In the seventh moon [1252] the Emperor ordered K’i-t’ah-t’êh
Pu-ha to carry war against the Ma-la-hi.’” (E. H. PARKER, _Asiatic
Quart. Rev._, Jan., 1904, p. 136.)

XXVI., p. 149. “On leaving the Castle [of the Old Man], you ride over
fine plains and beautiful valleys, and pretty hill-sides producing
excellent grass pasture, and abundance of fruits, and all other
products.... This kind of country extends for six days’ journey,
with a goodly number of towns and villages, in which the people are
worshippers of Mahommet. Sometimes also you meet with a tract of desert
extending for 50 or 60 miles, or somewhat less, and in these deserts
you find no water, but have to carry it along with you.... So after
travelling for six days as I have told you, you come to a city called
Sapurgan....”

Sven Hedin remarks: “From this it is apparent that the six days’
journey of fine country were traversed immediately before Marco Polo
reached Sapurgan. Sir Henry Yule says in a note: ‘Whether the true
route be, as I suppose, by Nishapur and Meshed, or, as Khanikoff
supposes, by Herat and Badghis, it is strange that no one of those
famous cities is mentioned. And we feel constrained to assume that
something has been misunderstood in the dictation, or has dropped out
of it.’ Yule removes the six days of fine country to the district
between Sebsevar and Meshed, and considers that for at least the first
day’s marches beyond Nishapur Marco Polo’s description agrees admirably
with that given by Fraser and Ferrier.

“I travelled between Sebsevar and Meshed in the autumn of 1890, and
I cannot perceive that Marco Polo’s description is applicable to the
country. He speaks of six days’ journey through beautiful valleys
and pretty hillsides. To the east of Sebsevar you come out into
desert country, which, however passes into fertile country with many
villages.[2] Then there comes a boundless dreary steppe to the south.
At the village Seng-i-kal-i-deh you enter an undulating country with
immense flocks of sheep. ‘The first stretch of the road between Shurab
and Nishapur led us through perfect desert ...; but the landscape soon
changed its aspect; the desert passed by degrees into cultivated
lands, and we rode past several villages surrounded by fields and
gardens.... We here entered the most fertile and densely peopled region
in Khorasan, in the midst of which the town of Nishapur is situated.’
Of the tract to the east of Nishapur I say: ‘Here are found innumerable
villages. The plain and slopes are dotted with them. This district
is extraordinarily densely inhabited and well cultivated.’ But then
all this magnificence comes to an end, and of the last day’s journey
between Kademgah and Meshed I write: ‘The country rose and we entered a
maze of low intricate hillocks.... The country was exceedingly dreary
and bare. Some flocks of sheep were seen, however, but what the fat
and sleek sheep lived on was a puzzle to me.... This dismal landscape
was more and more enlivened by travellers.... To the east stretched an
undulating steppe up to the frontier of Afghanistan.’

“The road between Sebsevar and Meshed is, in short, of such a character
that it can hardly fit in with Marco Polo’s enthusiastic description
of the six days. And as these came just before Sapurgan, one cannot
either identify the desert regions named with the deserts about the
middle course of the Murgab which extend between Meshed and Shibirkhan.
He must have crossed desert first, and it may be identified with the
nemek-sar or salt desert east of Tun and Kain. The six days must have
been passed in the ranges Paropamisus, Firuz-kuh, and Bend-i-Turkestan.
Marco Polo is not usually wont to scare his readers by descriptions
of mountainous regions, but at this place he speaks of mountains and
valleys and rich pastures. As it was, of course, his intention to
travel on into the heart of Asia, to make a détour through Sebsevar
was unnecessary and out of his way. If he had travelled to Sebsevar,
Nishapur, and Meshed, he would scarcely call the province of Tun-o-Kain
the extremity of Persia towards the north, even as the political
boundaries were then situated.

“From Balkh his wonderful journey proceeded further eastwards, and
therefore we take leave of him. Precisely in Eastern Persia his
descriptions are so brief that they leave free room for all kinds
of speculations. In the foregoing pages it has been simply my desire
to present a few new points of view. The great value of Marco Polo’s
description of the Persian desert consists in confirming and proving
its physical invariableness during more than six hundred years. It had
as great a scarcity of oases then as now, and the water in the wells
was not less salt than in our own days.” (_Overland to India_, II., pp.

                                DOGANA.

“The country of Dogana is quite certain to be the Chinese T’u-ho-lo or
Tokhara; for the position suits, and, moreover, nearly all the other
places named by Marco Polo along with Dogana occur in Chinese History
along with Tokhara many centuries before Polo’s arrival. Tokhara being
the most important, it is inconceivable that Marco Polo would omit it.
Thus, Poh-lo (Balkh), capital of the Eptals; Ta-la-kien (Talecan),
mentioned by Hiuan Tsang; Ho-sim or Ho-ts’z-mi (Casem), mentioned in
the _T’ang History_; Shik-nih or Shï-k’i-ni (Syghinan) of the _T’ang
History_; Woh-k’an (Vochan), of the same work; several forms of Bolor,
etc. (see also my remarks on the Pamir region in the _Contemporary
Review_ for Dec., 1897).” (E. H. PARKER, _Asiatic Quart. Rev._, Jan.,

                              BADAKHSHAN.

“The Chinese name for ‘Badakhshan’ never appears before the Pa-ta-shan
of Kúblái’s time.” (E. H. PARKER, _Asiatic Quart. Rev._, Jan., 1904, p.
143.)

XXX., pp. 164–166. “You must know that ten days’ journey to the south
of Badashan there is a province called PASHAI, the people of which have
a peculiar language, and are Idolaters, of a brown complexion. They are
great adepts in sorceries and the diabolic arts. The men wear earrings
and brooches of gold and silver set with stones and pearls. They are a
pestilent people and a crafty; and they live upon flesh and rice. Their
country is very hot.”

Sir A. STEIN writes (_Ancient Khotan_, I., pp. 14–15 n.): “Sir Henry
Yule was undoubtedly right in assuming that Marco Polo had never
personally visited these countries and that his account of them, brief
as it is, was derived from hearsay information about the tracts which
the Mongol partisan leader Nigūdar had traversed, about 1260 A.D.,
on an adventurous incursion from Badakhshān towards Kashmīr and the
Punjāb. In Chapter XVIII., where the Venetian relates that exploit (see
Yule, _Marco Polo_, I., p. 98, with note, p. 104), the name of Pashai
is linked with _Dīr_, the territory on the Upper Panjkōra river, which
an invader, wishing to make his way from Badakhshān into Kashmīr by the
most direct route, would necessarily have to pass through.

“The name _Pashai_ is still borne to this day by a Muhamadanized tribe
closely akin to the Siāh-pōsh, settled in the Panjshīr Valley and
in the hills on the west and south of Kāfiristān. It has been very
fully discussed by Sir Henry Yule (_Ibid._, I., p. 165), who shows
ample grounds for the belief that this tribal name must have once
been more widely spread over the southern slopes of the Hindu kúsh as
far as they are comprised in the limits of Kāfiristān. If the great
commentator nevertheless records his inability to account for Marco
Polo’s application of ‘the name Pashai to the country south-east of
Badakhshan,’ the reason of the difficulty seems to me to lie solely in
Sir Henry Yule’s assumption that the route heard of by the traveller,
led ‘by the Doráh or the Nuksán Pass, over the watershed of Hindu kúsh
into Chitrál and so to Dir.’

“Though such a route _viâ_ Chitrāl would, no doubt, have been
available in Marco Polo’s time as much as now, there is no indication
whatever forcing us to believe that it was the one really meant by
his informants. When Nigūdar ‘with a great body of horsemen, cruel
unscrupulous fellows’ went off from Badakhshān towards Kashmīr, he may
very well have made his way over the Hindu kúsh by the more direct
line that passes to Dīr through the eastern part of Kāfiristān. In
fact, the description of the Pashai people and their country, as
given by Marco Polo, distinctly points to such a route; for we have
in it an unmistakable reflex of characteristic features with which
the idolatrous Siāh-pōsh Kāfirs have always been credited by their
Muhammadan neighbours.

“It is much to be regretted that the Oriental records of the period, as
far as they were accessible to Sir Henry Yule, seemed to have retained
only faint traces of the Mongol adventurer’s remarkable inroad. From
the point of view of Indian history it was, no doubt, a mere passing
episode. But some details regarding it would possess special interest
as illustrating an instance of successful invasion by a route that so
far has not received its due share of attention.” [See _supra_, pp. 4,

“The Chinese Toba Dynasty History mentions, in company with Samarcand,
_K’a-shī-mih_ (Cashmeer), and Kapisa, a State called _Pan-shê_, as
sending tribute to North China along with the Persian group of States.
This name _Pan-shê_ 半社 does not, to the best of my belief, occur a
second time in any Chinese record.” (PARKER, _Asiatic Quart. Rev._,
Jan., 1904, p. 135.)

XXX., p. 164. “Now let us proceed and speak of another country which is
seven day’s journey from this one [Pashai] towards the south-east, and
the name of which is KESHIMUR.”

This short estimate has perplexed Sir Henry Yule, _l.c._, p. 166. Sir
Aurel Stein remarks in a note, _Serindia_, I., p. 12: “The route above
indicated [Nigudar’s route] permits an explanation. Starting from some
point like Arnawal on the Kūnār River which certainly would be well
within ‘Pashai,’ lightly equipped horsemen could by that route easily
reach the border of Agrōr on the Indus within seven days. Speaking
from personal knowledge of almost the whole of the ground I should be
prepared to do the ride myself by the following stages: Dīr, Warai,
Sado, Chakdara, Kin kargalai, Bājkatta, Kai or Darband on the Indus. It
must be borne in mind that, as Yule rightly recognized, Marco Polo is
merely reproducing information derived from a Mongol source and based
on Nigudar’s raid; and further that Hazāra and the valley of the Jhelam
were probably then still dependent on the Kashmīr kingdom, as they were
certainly in Kalhana’s time, only a century earlier. As to the rate
at which Mongols were accustomed to travel on ‘Dak,’ cf. Yule, _Marco
Polo_, I., pp. 434 _seq._”

XXXII., pp. 170, 171. “The people [of Badashan] are Mahommetans, and
valiant in war.... They [the people of Vokhan] are gallant soldiers.”

In Afghan Wakhan, Sir Aurel Stein writes:

“On we cantered at the head of quite a respectable cavalcade to where,
on the sandy plain opposite to the main hamlet of Sarhad, two companies
of foot with a squad of cavalry, close on two hundred men in all, were
drawn up as a guard of honour. Hardy and well set up most of them
looked, giving the impression of thoroughly serviceable human material,
in spite of a manifestly defective drill and the motley appearance of
dress and equipment. They belonged, so the Colonel explained to me
afterwards, to a sort of militia drafted from the local population
of the Badakhshan valleys and Wakhan into the regiments permanently
echeloned as frontier guards along the Russian border on the Oxus.
Apart from the officers, the proportion of true Pathans among them
was slight. Yet I could well believe from all I saw and heard, that,
properly led and provided for, these sturdy Iranian hillmen might give
a good account of themselves. Did not Marco Polo speak of the people of
‘Badashan’ as ‘valiant in war’ and of the men of ‘Vokhan’ as gallant
soldiers?” (_Ruins of Desert Cathay_, I., p. 66.)

XXXII., pp. 170 _seq._

In Chap. III., pp. 64–66, of his _Serindia_, Sir Aurel Stein has the
following on Marco Polo’s account of Wakhan:—

“After Wu-k’ung’s narrative of his journey the Chinese sources of
information about the Pāmīrs and the adjoining regions run dry for
nearly a thousand years. But that the routes leading across them
from Wakhān retained their importance also in Muhammedan times is
attested by the greatest of mediæval travellers, Marco Polo. I have
already, in _Ancient Khotan_ [pp. 41 _seq._], discussed the portion
of his itinerary which deals with the journey across the Pāmīrs to
‘the kingdom of Cascar’ or Kāshgar, and it only remains here to note
briefly what he tells us of the route by which he approached them from
Badakhshan: ‘In leaving Badashan you ride twelve days between east and
north-east, ascending a river that runs through land belonging to a
brother of the Prince of Badashan, and containing a good many towns and
villages and scattered habitations. The people are Mahommetans, and
valiant in war. At the end of those twelve days you come to a province
of no great size, extending indeed no more than three days’ journey in
any direction, and this is called VOKHAN. The people worship Mahommet,
and they have a peculiar language. They are gallant soldiers, and they
have a chief whom they call NONE, which is as much as to say _Count_,
and they are liegemen to the Prince of Badashan.’ [Polo, I., pp.
170–171.]

“Sir Henry Yule was certainly right in assuming that ‘the river along
which Marco travels from Badakhshan is no doubt the upper stream of
the Oxus, locally known as the Panja.... It is true that the river
is reached from Badakhshan Proper by ascending another river (the
Vardoj) and crossing the Pass of Ishkáshm, but in the brief style
of our narrative we must expect such condensation.’ [Polo, I., pp.
172–3.] Marco’s great commentator was guided by equally true judgment
when he recognized in the indications of this passage the same system
of government that prevailed in the Oxus valleys until modern times.
Under it the most of the hill tracts dependent from Badakhshan,
including Ishkāshim and Wakhān, were ruled not direct by the Mir, but
by relations of his or hereditary chiefs who held their districts on
a feudal tenure. The twelve days’ journey which Marco records between
Badashan and ‘Vokhan’ are, I think, easily accounted for if it is
assumed that the distance from capital to capital is meant; for twelve
marches are still allowed for as the distance from Bahārak, the old
Badakhshan capital on the Vardoj, to Kila Panja.

“That the latter was in Marco’s days, as at present, the chief place
of Wakhān is indicated also by his narrative of the next stage of his
journey. ‘And when you leave this little country, and ride three days
north-east, always among mountains, you get to such a height that
’tis said to be the highest place in the world! And when you have got
to this height you find [a great lake between two mountains, and out
of it] a fine river running through a plain.... The plain is called
PAMIER.’ The bearing and descriptive details here given point clearly
to the plain of the Great Pāmir and Victoria Lake, its characteristic
feature. About sixty-two miles are reckoned from Langar-kisht, the last
village on the northern branch of the Āb-i-Panja and some six miles
above Kila Panja, to Mazār-tapa where the plain of the Great Pamīr may
be said to begin, and this distance agrees remarkably well with the
three marches mentioned by Marco.

“His description of Wakhān as ‘a province of no great size, extending
indeed no more than three days’ journey in any direction’ suggests that
a portion of the valley must then have formed part of the chiefship
of Ishkāshim or Zebak over which we may suppose ‘the brother of the
Prince of Badashan’ to have ruled. Such fluctuations in the extent of
Wakhān territory are remembered also in modern times. Thus Colonel
Trotter, who visited Wakhān with a section of the Yarkand Mission in
1874, distinctly notes that ‘Wakhān formerly contained three “sads”
or hundreds, _i.e._, districts, containing 100 houses each’ (_viz._
Sad-i-Sar-hadd, Sad Sipang, Sad Khandūt). To these Sad Ishtragh, the
tract extending from Dīgargand to Ishkāshim, is declared to have
been added in recent times, having formerly been an independent
principality. It only remains to note that Marco was right, too, in
his reference to the peculiar language of Wakhān; for Wakhī—which is
spoken not only by the people of Wakhān but also by the numerous Wakhī
colonists spread through Mastūj, Hunza Sarikol, and even further east
in the mountains—is a separate language belonging to the well-defined
group of Galcha tongues which itself forms the chief extant branch of
Eastern Iranian.”

XXXII., pp. 171 _seq._, 175, 182.

                         THE PLATEAU OF PAMIR.

“On leaving Tāsh-kurghān (July 10, 1900), my steps, like those of
Hiuan-tsang, were directed towards Kāshgar.... In Chapters V.–VII.
of my Personal Narrative I have given a detailed description of this
route, which took me past Muztāgh-Ata to Lake Little Kara-kul, and
then round the foot of the great glacier-crowned range northward into
the Gez defile, finally debouching at Tāshmalik into the open plain of
Kāshgari. Though scarcely more difficult than the usual route over the
Chichiklik Pass and by Yangi-Hīsar, it is certainly longer and leads
for a considerably greater distance over ground which is devoid of
cultivation or permanent habitations.

“It is the latter fact which makes me believe that Professor H. Cordier
was right in tracing by this very route Marco Polo’s itinerary from
the Central Pamirs to Kāshgar. The Venetian traveller, coming from
Wakhān, reached, after three days, a great lake which may be either
Lake Victoria or Lake Chakmak, at a ‘height that is said to be the
highest place in the world.’ He then describes faithfully enough the
desert plain called ‘Pamier,’ which he makes extend for the distance
of a twelve days’ ride, and next tells us: ‘Now, if we go on with our
journey towards the east-north-east, we travel a good forty days,
continually passing over mountains and hills, or through valleys, and
crossing many rivers and tracts of wilderness. And in all this way you
find neither habitation of man, nor any green thing, but must carry
with you whatever you require.’

“This reference to continuous ‘tracts of wilderness’ shows clearly
that, for one reason or another, Marco Polo did not pass through the
cultivated valleys of Tāsh-kurghān or Tagharma, as he would necessarily
have done if his route to Kāshgar, the region he next describes, had
lain over the Chichiklik Pass. We must assume that, after visiting
either the Great or Little Pāmīr, he travelled down the Ak-su river for
some distance, and then crossing the watershed eastwards by one of the
numerous passes struck the route which leads past Muztāgh-Ata and on
towards the Gez defile. In the brief supplementary notes contributed to
Professor Cordier’s critical analysis of this portion of Marco Polo’s
itinerary, I have pointed out how thoroughly the great Venetian’s
description of the forty days’ journey to the E.N.E. of the Pāmīr Lake
can be appreciated by any one who has passed through the Pāmīr region
and followed the valleys stretching round the Muztāgh-Ata range on the
west and north (cf. Yule, _Marco Polo_, II., pp. 593 _seq._). After
leaving Tāsh-kurghān and Tagharma there is no local produce to be
obtained until the oasis of Tāshmalik is reached. In the narrow valley
of the Yamān-yār river, forming the Gez defile, there is scarcely any
grazing; its appearance down to its opening into the plain is, in fact,
far more desolate than that of the elevated Pāmīr regions.

“In the absence of any data as to the manner and season in which Marco
Polo’s party travelled, it would serve no useful purpose to hazard
explanations as to why he should assign a duration of forty days to
a journey which for a properly equipped traveller need not take more
than fifteen or sixteen days, even when the summer floods close the
passage through the lower Gez defile, and render it necessary to follow
the circuitous track over the Tokuk Dawān or ‘Nine Passes.’ But it is
certainly worth mention that Benedict Goëz, too, speaks of the desert
of ‘Pāmech’ (Pāmīr) as taking forty days to cross if the snow was
extensive, a record already noted by Sir H. Yule (_Cathay_, II., pp.
563 _seq._). It is also instructive to refer once more to the personal
experience of the missionary traveller on the alternative route by
the Chichiklik Pass. According to the record quoted above, he appears
to have spent no less than twenty-eight days in the journeys from
the hamlets of ‘Sarcil’ (Sarīkol, _i.e._ Tāsh-kurghān) to ‘Hiarchan’
(Yarkand)—a distance of some 188 miles, now reckoned at ten days’
march.” (Stein, _Ancient Khotan_, pp. 40–42.)

XXXII., p. 171. “The Plain is called PAMIER, and you ride across it for
twelve days together, finding nothing but a desert without habitations
or any green thing, so that travellers are obliged to carry with them
whatever they have need of.”

At Sarhad, Afghan Wakhan, Stein, _Ruins of Desert Cathay_, I., p.
69, writes: “There was little about the low grey houses, or rather
hovels, of mud and rubble to indicate the importance which from early
times must have attached to Sarhad as the highest place of permanent
occupation on the direct route leading from the Oxus to the Tarim
Basin. Here was the last point where caravans coming from the Bactrian
side with the products of the Far West and of India could provision
themselves for crossing that high tract of wilderness ‘called Pamier’
of which old Marco Polo rightly tells us: ‘You ride across it...’ And
as I looked south towards the snow-covered saddle of the Baroghil,
the route I had followed myself, it was equally easy to realize why
Kao Hsien-chih’s strategy had, after the successful crossing of the
Pamirs, made the three columns of his Chinese Army concentrate upon the
stronghold of Lien-yün, opposite the present Sarhad. Here was the base
from which Yasin could be invaded and the Tibetans ousted from their
hold upon the straight route to the Indus.”

XXXII., p. 174.

“The note connecting Hiuan Tsang’s Kieh sha with Kashgar is probably
based upon an error of the old translators, for the Sita River was in
the Pamir region, and _K’a sha_ was one of the names of Kasanna, or
Kieh-shwang-na, in the Oxus region.” (E. H. PARKER, _Asiatic Quart.

“The old statement is repeated that the Yüeh Chi, or Indo-Scyths
(_i.e._ the Eptals), ‘are said to have been of Tibetan origin.’ A long
account of this people was given in the _Asiatic Quart. Rev._ for July,
1902. It seems much more likely that they were a branch of the Hiung-nu
or Turks. Albiruni’s ‘report’ that they were of Tibetan origin is
probably founded on the Chinese statement that some of their ways were
like Tibetan ways, and that polyandry existed amongst them; also that
they fled from the Hiung-nu westwards along the _north edge_ of the
Tibetan territory, and some of them took service as Tibetan officials.”

                                BOLOR.

We read in the _Tarikh-i-Rashidi_ of Mirza Haidar (Notes by Ney Elias;
translated by E. D. Ross, 1895), p. 135, that Sultán Said Khán, son
of Mansur Khán, sent the writer in the year 934 (1528), “with Rashid
Sultán, to Balur, which is a country of infidels [_Káfiristán_],
between Badakhshan and Kashmir, where we conducted successfully a holy
war [_ghazát_], and returned victorious, loaded with booty and covered
with glory.”

Mirza Haidar gives the following description of Bolor (pp. 384–5):
“Balur is an infidel country [_Káfiristán_], and most of its
inhabitants are mountaineers. Not one of them has a religion or a
creed. Nor is there anything which they [consider it right to] abstain
from or to avoid [as impure]; but they do whatever they list, and
follow their desires without check or compunction. Baluristán is
bounded on the east by the province of Káshgar and Yárkand; on the
north by Badakhshán; on the west by Kábul and Lumghán; and on the
south by the dependencies of Kashmir. It is four months’ journey in
circumference. Its whole extent consists of mountains, valleys, and
defiles, insomuch that one might almost say that in the whole of
Baluristán, not one _farsákh_ of level ground is to be met with. The
population is numerous. No village is at peace with another, but there
is constant hostility, and fights are continually occurring among them.”

From the note to this passage (p. 385) we note that “for some twenty
years ago, Mr. E. B. Shaw found that the Kirghiz of the Pamirs called
Chitrál by the name of _Pálor_. To all other inhabitants of the
surrounding regions, however, the word appears now to be unknown....

“The Balur country would then include Hunza, Nagar, possibly Tásh
Kurghán, Gilgit, Panyál, Yasin, Chitrál, and probably the tract now
known as Kafiristan: while, also, some of the small states south of
Gilgit, Yasin, etc., may have been regarded as part of Balur....

“The conclusions arrived at [by Sir H. Yule], are very nearly borne
out by Mirza Haidar’s description. The only differences are (1) that,
according to our author, Baltistán cannot have been included in Balur,
as he always speaks of that country, later in his work, as a separate
province with the name of _Balti_, and says that it bordered on Balur;
and (2) that _Balur_ was confined almost entirely, as far as I am
able to judge from his description in this passage and elsewhere, to
the southern slopes of the Eastern Hindu Kush, or Indus water-parting
range; while Sir H. Yule’s map makes it embrace Sárigh-Kul and the
greater part of the eastern Pamirs.”

XXXIII., p. 182. “The natives [of Cascar] are a wretched, niggardly set
of people; they eat and drink in miserable fashion.”

The people of Kashgar seem to have enjoyed from early times a
reputation for rough manners and deceit (Stein, _Ancient Khotan_, p.
49 n). Stein, p. 70, recalls Hiuan Tsang’s opinion: “The disposition
of the men is fierce and impetuous, and they are mostly false and
deceitful. They make light of decorum and politeness, and esteem
learning but little.” Stein adds, p. 70, with regard to Polo’s
statement: “Without being able to adduce from personal observation
evidence as to the relative truth of the latter statement, I believe
that the judgements recorded by both those great travellers may be
taken as a fair reflex of the opinion in which the ‘Kāshgarliks’ are
held to this day by the people of other Turkestān districts, especially
by the Khotanese. And in the case of Hiuan Tsang at least, it seems
probable from his long stay in, and manifest attachment to, Khotan that
this neighbourly criticism might have left an impression upon him.”

XXXVI., p. 188.

                                KHOTAN.

Sir Aurel Stein writes (_Ancient Khotan_, I., pp. 139–140): “Marco
Polo’s account of Khotan and the Khotanese forms an apt link between
these early Chinese notices and the picture drawn from modern
observation. It is brief but accurate in all details. The Venetian
found the people ‘subject to the Great Kaan’ and ‘all worshippers of
Mahommet.’ ‘There are numerous towns and villages in the country,
but Cotan, the capital, is the most noble of all and gives its name
to the kingdom. Everything is to be had there in plenty, including
abundance of cotton [with flax, hemp, wheat, wine, and the like]. The
people have vineyards and gardens and estates. They live by commerce
and manufactures, and are no soldiers.’ Nor did the peculiar laxity of
morals, which seems always to have distinguished the people of the
Khotan region, escape Marco Polo’s attention. For of the ‘Province of
Pein,’ which, as we shall see, represents the oases of the adjoining
modern district of Keriya, he relates the custom that ‘if the husband
of any woman go away upon a journey and remain away for more than
twenty days, as soon as that term is past the woman may marry another
man, and the husband also may then marry whom he pleases.’

“No one who has visited Khotan or who is familiar with the modern
accounts of the territory, can read the early notices above extracted
without being struck at once by the fidelity with which they reflect
characteristic features of the people at the present day. Nor is it
necessary to emphasize the industrial pre-eminence which Khotan still
enjoys in a variety of manufactures through the technical skill and
inherited training of the bulk of its population.”

Sir Aurel Stein further remarks (_Ancient Khotan_, I., p. 183): “When
Marco Polo visited Khotan on his way to China, between the years 1271
and 1275, the people of the oasis were flourishing, as the Venetian’s
previously quoted account shows. His description of the territories
further east, Pein, Cherchen, and Lop, which he passed through before
crossing ‘the Great Desert’ to Sha-chou, leaves no doubt that the route
from Khotan into Kan-su was in his time a regular caravan road. Marco
Polo found the people of Khotan ‘all worshippers of Mahommet’ and the
territory subject to the ‘Great Kaan’, _i.e._ Kúblái, whom by that time
almost the whole of the Middle Kingdom acknowledged as emperor. While
the neighbouring Yarkand owed allegiance to Kaidu, the ruler of the
Chagatai dominion, Khotan had thus once more renewed its old historical
connexion with China.”

XXXVI., p. 190.

“A note of Yule’s on p. 190 of vol. I. describes Johnson’s report
on the people of Khoten (1865) as having ‘a slightly Tartar cast
of countenance.’ The Toba History makes the same remark 1300 years
earlier: ‘From Kao-ch’ang (Turfan) westwards the people of the various
countries have deep eyes and high noses; the features in only this one
country (Khoten) are not very _Hu_ (Persian, etc.), but rather like
Chinese.’ I published a tolerably complete digest of Lob Nor and Khoten
early history from Chinese sources, in the _Anglo-Russian Society’s
Journal_ for Jan. and April, 1903. It appears to me that the ancient

I have embodied, in Vol. II., p. 595, of Marco Polo, some of the
remarks of Sir Aurel Stein regarding Pein and Uzun Tati. In _Ancient
Khotan_, I., pp. 462–3, he has given further evidence of the identity
of Uzun Tati and P’i mo, and he has discussed the position of
Ulūg-Ziārat, probably the Han mo of Sung Yun.

XXXVII., p. 191; II., p. 595.

“Keriya, the Pein of Marco Polo and Pimo of Hwen Tsiang, writes
Huntington, is a pleasant district, with a population of about fifteen
thousand souls.” Huntington discusses (p. 387) the theory of Stein:

“Stein identifies Pimo or Pein, with ancient Kenan, the site ... now
known as Uzun Tetti or Ulugh Mazar, north of Chira. This identification
is doubtful, as appears from the following table of distances given by
Hwen Tsiang, which is as accurate as could be expected from a casual
traveller. I have reckoned the ‘li,’ the Chinese unit of distance, as
equivalent to 0·26 of a mile.

                                                     Distance according
        Names of Places.             True Distance.   to Hwen Tsiang.
  Khotan (Yutien) to Keriya (Pimo)      97 miles.    330 li.  86 miles.
  Keriya (Pimo) to Niya (Niyang)        64   „       200  „   52   „
  Niya (Niyang) to Endereh (Tuholo)     94   „       400  „  104   „
  Endereh (Tuholo) to Kotāk Sheri?
     (Chemotona)                       138?  „       600  „  156   „
  Kotak Sheri (Chemotona) to Lulan
     (Nafopo)                          264?  „      1000  „  260   „

“If we use the value of the ‘li’ 0·274 of a mile given by Hedin, the
distances from Khotān to Keriya and from Keriya to Niya, according to
Hwen Tsiang, become 91 and 55 miles instead of 86 and 52 as given in
the table, which is not far from the true distances, 97 and 64.

“If, however, Pimo is identical with Kenan, as Stein thinks,
the distances which Hwen Tsiang gives as 86 and 52 miles become
respectively 60 and 89, which is evidently quite wrong.

“Strong confirmation of the identification of Keriya with Pimo is
found in a comparison of extracts from Marco Polo’s and Hwen Tsiang’s
accounts of that city with passages from my note-book, written long
before I had read the comments of the ancient travellers. Marco Polo
says that the people of Pein, or Pima, as he also calls it, have the
peculiar custom ‘that if a married man goes to a distance from home
to be about twenty days, his wife has a right, if she is so inclined,
to take another husband; and the men, on the same principle, marry
wherever they happen to reside.’ The quotation from my notes runs as
follows: ‘The women of the place are noted for their attractiveness and
loose character. It is said that many men coming to Keriya for a short
time become enamoured of the women here, and remain permanently, taking
new wives and abandoning their former wives and families.’

“Hwen Tsiang observed that thirty ‘li,’ seven or eight miles, west
of Pimo, there is ‘a great desert marsh, upwards of several acres in
extent, without any verdure whatever. The surface is reddish black.’
The natives explained to the pilgrim that it was the blood-stained site
of a great battle fought many years before. Eighteen miles north-west
of Keriya bazaar, or ten miles from the most westerly village of the
oasis, I observed that ‘some areas which are flooded part of the year
are of a deep rich red colour, due to a small plant two or three inches
high.’ I saw such vegetation nowhere else and apparently it was an
equally unusual sight to Hwen Tsiang.

“In addition to these somewhat conclusive observations, Marco Polo says
that jade is found in the river of Pimo, which is true of the Keriya,
but not of the Chira, or the other rivers near Kenan.” (Ellsworth
HUNTINGTON, _The Pulse of Asia_, pp. 387–8.)

XXXVIII., p. 194. “The whole of the Province [of Charchan] is sandy, and
so is the road all the way from Pein, and much of the water that you
find is bitter and bad. However, at some places you do find fresh and
sweet water.”

Sir Aurel Stein remarks (_Ancient Khotan_, I., p. 436): “Marco Polo’s
description, too, ‘of the Province of Charchan’ would agree with the
assumption that the route west of Charchan was not altogether devoid of
settlements even as late as the thirteenth century.... [His] account
of the route agrees accurately with the conditions now met with
between Niya and Charchan. Yet in the passage immediately following,
the Venetian tells us how ‘when an army passes through the land, the
people escape with their wives, children, and cattle a distance of two
or three days’ journey into the sandy waste; and, knowing the spots
where water is to be had, they are able to live there, and to keep
their cattle alive, while it is impossible to discover them.’ It seems
to me clear that Marco Polo alludes here to the several river courses
which, after flowing north of the Niya-Charchan route, lose themselves
in the desert. The jungle belt of their terminal areas, no doubt,
offered then, as it would offer now, safe places of refuge to any small
settlements established along the route southwards.”

XXXIX., P. 197.

                          OF THE CITY OF LOP.

Stein remarks, _Ruins of Desert Cathay_, I., p. 343: “Broad
geographical facts left no doubt for any one acquainted with local
conditions that Marco Polo’s Lop, ‘a large town at the edge of the
Desert’ where ‘travellers repose before entering on the Desert’ _en
route_ for Sha chou and China proper, must have occupied the position
of the present Charklik. Nor could I see any reason for placing
elsewhere the capital of that ‘ancient kingdom of Na-fo-po, the same as
the territory of Lou-lan,’ which Hiuan Tsang reached after ten marches
to the north-east of Chü-mo or Charchan, and which was the pilgrim’s
last stage before his return to Chinese soil.”

In his third journey (1913–1916), Stein left Charchan on New Year’s
Eve, 1914, and arrived at Charkhlik on January 8, saying: “It was from
this modest little oasis, the only settlement of any importance in the
Lop region, representing Marco Polo’s ‘City of Lop,’ that I had to
raise the whole of the supplies, labour, and extra camels needed by the
several parties for the explorations I had carefully planned during the
next three months in the desert between Lop-nor and Tunhuang.”

“The name of LOB appears under the form _Lo pou_ in the _Yuan-shi_,
_s.a._ 1282 and 1286. In 1286, it is mentioned as a postal station
near those of K’ie-t’ai, Che-ch’an and Wo-tuan. Wo-tuan is Khotan.
Che-ch’an, the name of which reappears in other paragraphs, is
Charchan. As to K’ie-t’ai, a postal station between those of
Lob and Charchan, it seems probable that it is the Kätäk of the
_Tarikh-i-Rashidi_.” (PELLIOT.)

XXXIX., pp. 196–7.

                           THE GREAT DESERT.

After reproducing the description of the Great Desert in Sir Henry
Yule’s version, Stein adds, _Ruins of Desert Cathay_, I., p. 518:

“It did not need my journey to convince me that what Marco here tells
us about the risks of the desert was but a faithful reflex of old
folklore beliefs he must have heard on the spot. Sir Henry Yule has
shown long ago that the dread of being led astray by evil spirits
haunted the imagination of all early travellers who crossed the desert
wastes between China and the oases westwards. Fa-hsien’s above-quoted
passage clearly alludes to this belief, and so does Hiuan Tsang, as we
have seen, where he points in graphic words the impressions left by his
journey through the sandy desert between Niya and Charchan.

“Thus, too, the description we receive through the Chinese
historiographer, Ma Tuan-lin, of the shortest route from China towards
Kara-shahr, undoubtedly corresponding to the present track to Lop-nor,
reads almost like a version from Marco’s book, though its compiler, a
contemporary of the Venetian traveller, must have extracted it from
some earlier source. ‘You see nothing in any direction but the sky and
the sands, without the slightest trace of a road; and travellers find
nothing to guide them but the bones of men and beasts and the droppings
of camels. During the passage of this wilderness you hear sounds,
sometimes of singing, sometimes of wailing; and it has often happened
that travellers going aside to see what these sounds might be have
strayed from their course and been entirely lost; for they were voices
of spirits and goblins.’...

“As Yule rightly observes, ‘these Goblins are not peculiar to the
Gobi.’ Yet I felt more than ever assured that Marco’s stories about
them were of genuine local growth, when I had travelled over the whole
route and seen how closely its topographical features agree with the
matter-of-fact details which the first part of his chapter records.
Anticipating my subsequent observations, I may state here at once
that Marco’s estimate of the distance and the number of marches on
this desert crossing proved perfectly correct. For the route from
Charklik, his ‘town of Lop,’ to the ‘City of Sachiu,’ _i.e._ Sha-chou
or Tun-huang, our plane-table survey, checked by cyclometer readings,
showed an aggregate marching distance of close on 380 miles.”

               OF THE CITY OF LOP AND THE GREAT DESERT.

“In the hope of contributing something toward the solution of these
questions [contradictory statements of Prjevalsky, Richthofen, and Sven
Hedin],” writes Huntington, “I planned to travel completely around
the unexplored part of the ancient lake, crossing the Lop desert in
its widest part. As a result of the journey, I became convinced that
two thousand years ago the lake was of great size, covering both the
ancient and the modern locations; then it contracted, and occupied
only the site shown on the Chinese maps; again, in the Middle Ages, it
expanded; and at present it has contracted and occupies the modern site.

“Now, as in Marco Polo’s days, the traveller must equip his caravan for
the desert at Charklik, also known as Lop, two days’ journey south-west
of the lake.” (Ellsworth HUNTINGTON, _The Pulse of Asia_, pp. 240–1.)

                      NOISES IN THE GREAT DESERT.

As an answer to a paper by C. TOMLINSON, in _Nature_, Nov. 28, 1895,
p. 78, we find in the same periodical, April 30, 1896, LIII., p. 605,
the following note by KUMAGUSU MINAKATA:

“The following passage in a Chinese itinerary of Central Asia—Chun
Yuen’s _Si-yih-kien-wan-luh_, 1777 (British Museum, No. 15271, b. 14),
tom. VII., fol. 13 b.—appears to describe the icy sounds similar to
what Ma or Head observed in North America (see _supra_, _ibid._, p. 78).

“Muh-süh-urh-tah-fan (= Muzart), that is Ice Mountain [_Snowy_
according to Prjevalsky], is situated between Ili and Ushi.... In case
that one happens to be travelling there close to sunset, he should
choose a rock of moderate thickness and lay down on it. In solitary
night then, he would hear the sounds, now like those of gongs and
bells, and now like those of strings and pipes, which disturb ears
through the night: these are produced by multifarious noises coming
from the cracking ice.”

Kumagusu Minakata has another note on remarkable sounds in Japan in
_Nature_, LIV., May 28, 1896, p. 78.

Sir T. Douglas Forsyth, _Buried Cities in the Shifting Sands of the
Great Desert of Gobi, Proc. Roy. Geog. Soc._, Nov. 13, 1876, says,
p. 29: “The stories told by Marco Polo, in his 39th chapter, about
shifting sands and strange noises and demons, have been repeated by
other travellers down to the present time. Colonel Prjevalsky, in pp.
193 and 194 of his interesting _Travels_, gives his testimony to the
superstitions of the Desert; and I find, on reference to my diary,
that the same stories were recounted to me in Kashgar, and I shall be
able to show that there is some truth in the report of treasures being
exposed to view.”

P. 201, Line 12. Read the Governor of Urumtsi _founded_ instead of
_found_.

XL., p. 203. Marco Polo comes to a city called Sachiu belonging to a
province called Tangut. “The people are for the most part Idolaters....
The Idolaters have a peculiar language, and are no traders, but live by
their agriculture. They have a great many abbeys and minsters full of
idols of sundry fashions, to which they pay great honour and reverence,
worshipping them and sacrificing to them with much ado.”

Sachiu, or rather Tun Hwang, is celebrated for its “Caves of Thousand
Buddhas”; Sir Aurel Stein wrote the following remarks in his _Ruins of
Desert Cathay_, II., p. 27: “Surely it was the sight of these colossal
images, some reaching nearly a hundred feet in height, and the vivid
first impressions retained of the cult paid to them, which had made
Marco Polo put into his chapter on ‘Sachiu,’ _i.e._ Tun-huang, a long
account of the strange idolatrous customs of the people of Tangut....
Tun-huang manifestly had managed to retain its traditions of Buddhist
piety down to Marco’s days. Yet there was plentiful antiquarian
evidence showing that most of the shrines and art remains at the
Halls of the Thousand Buddhas dated back to the period of the T’ang
Dynasty, when Buddhism flourished greatly in China. Tun-huang, as the
westernmost outpost of China proper, had then for nearly two centuries
enjoyed imperial protection both against the Turks in the north and
the Tibetans southward. But during the succeeding period, until the
advent of paramount Mongol power, some two generations before Marco
Polo’s visit, these marches had been exposed to barbarian inroads of
all sorts. The splendour of the temples and the number of the monks
and nuns established near them had, no doubt, sadly diminished in the
interval.”

XL., p. 205.

Prof. Pelliot accepts as a Mongol plural _Tangut_, but remarks that
it is very ancient, as _Tangut_ is already to be found in the Orkhon
inscriptions. At the time of Chingiz, _Tangut_ was a singular in
Mongol, and _Tangu_ is nowhere to be found.

XL., p. 206.

The Tangutans are descendants of the Tang-tu-chüeh; it must be
understood that they are descendants of _T’u Kiueh_ of the T’ang
Period. (PELLIOT.)

Prof. Parker remarks (_Asiatic Quart. Rev._, Jan., 1904, p. 142) that:
“The Chinese (Manchu) agent at Urga has not (nor, I believe, ever
had) any control over the Little Bucharia Cities. Moreover, since the
reconquest of Little Bucharia in 1877–1878, the whole of those cities
have been placed under the Governor of the New Territory (Kan Suh
Sin-kiang Sün-fu), whose capital is at Urumtsi. The native Mohammedan
Princes of Hami have still left to them a certain amount of home rule,
and so lately as 1902 a decree appointing the rotation of their visits
to Peking was issued. The present Prince’s name is _Shamu Hust_, or
_Hussot_.”

XLII., p. 215.

                     THE PROVINCE OF CHINGINTALAS.

Prof. E. H. PARKER writes in the _Journ. of the North China Branch of
the Royal As. Soc._, XXXVII., 1906, p. 195: “On p. 215 of Yule’s Vol.
I. some notes of Palladius’ are given touching Chingkintalas, but it
is not stated that Palladius supposed the word _Ch’ih kin_ to date
after the Mongols, that is, that Palladius felt uncertain about his
identification. But Palladius is mistaken in feeling thus uncertain: in
1315 and 1326 the Mongol History twice mentions the garrison starts at
_Ch’ih kin_, and in such a way that the place must be where Marco Polo
puts it, _i.e._ west of Kia-yüh Kwan.”

                      OF THE PROVINCE OF SUKCHUR.

XLIII., p. 217. “Over all the mountains of this province rhubarb is
found in great abundance, and thither merchants come to buy it, and
carry it thence all over the world. Travellers, however, dare not visit
those mountains with any cattle but those of the country, for a certain
plant grows there which is so poisonous that cattle which eat it loose
their hoofs. The cattle of the country know it and eschew it.”

During his crossing of the Nan Shan, Sir Aurel Stein had the same
experience, five of his ponies being “benumbed and refusing to touch
grass or fodder.” The traveller notes that, _Ruins of Desert Cathay_,
II., p. 303: “I at once suspected that they had eaten of the poisonous
grass which infests certain parts of the Nan Shan, and about which
old Marco has much to tell in his chapter on ‘Sukchur’ or Su-chou.
The Venetian’s account had proved quite true; for while my own ponies
showed all the effects of this inebriating plant, the local animals had
evidently been wary of it. A little bleeding by the nose, to which Tila
Bai, with the veterinary skill of an old Ladak ‘Kirakash,’ promptly
proceeded, seemed to afford some relief. But it took two or three days
before the poor brutes were again in full possession of their senses
and appetites.”

“Wild rhubarb, for which the Nan-shan was famous in Marco Polo’s days,
spread its huge fleshy leaves everywhere.” (STEIN, _Ruins of Desert
Cathay_, II., p. 305.)

XLIII., p. 218.

                               SUKCHUR.

The first character of Suchau was pronounced _Suk_ at the time of the
T’ang; we find a _Sughčiu_ in von Le Coq’s MSS. from Turkestan and
_Sughču_ in the runnic text of W. Thomsen; cf. PELLIOT, _J. As._,
Mai–Juin, 1912, p. 591; the pronunciation _Suk_-chau was still used by
travellers coming from Central Asia—for instance, by the envoys of Shah
Rukh. See _Cathay_, III., p. 126 n.

                       OF THE CITY OF CAMPICHU.

XLIV., pp. 219 _seq._ “The Idolaters have many minsters and abbeys
after their fashion. In these they have an enormous number of idols,
both small and great, certain of the latter being a good ten paces in
stature; some of them being of wood, others of clay, and others yet of
stone. They are all highly polished, and then covered with gold. The
great idols of which I speak lie at length. And round about them there
are other figures of considerable size, as if adoring and paying homage
before them.”

The ambassadors of Shah Rukh to China (1419–1422) wrote:

“In this city of Kamchau there is an idol temple five hundred cubits
square. In the middle is an idol lying at length, which measures fifty
paces. The sole of the foot is nine paces long, and the instep is
twenty-one cubits in girth. Behind this image and overhead are other
idols of a cubit (?) in height, besides figures of _Bakshis_ as large
as life. The action of all is hit off so admirably that you would think
they were alive. Against the wall also are other figures of perfect
execution. The great sleeping idol has one hand under his head, and
the other resting on his thigh. It is gilt all over, and is known as
_Shakamuni-fu_. The people of the country come in crowds to visit it,
and bow to the very ground before this idol” (_Cathay_, I., p. 277).

XLV., p. 223.

                        OF THE CITY OF ETZINA.

I said, I., p. 225, that this town must be looked for on the river
_Hei-shui_ called _Etsina_ by the Mongols, and would be situated on
the river on the border of the Desert, at the top of a triangle,
whose bases would be Suhchau and Kanchau. My theory seems to be fully
confirmed by Sir Aurel Stein, who writes:

“Advantages of geographical position must at all times have invested
this extensive riverine tract, limited as are its resources, with
considerable importance for those, whether armed host or traders, who
would make the long journey from the heart of Mongolia in the north
to the Kansu oases. It had been the same with the ancient Lou-lan
delta, without which the Chinese could not have opened up the earliest
and most direct route for the expansion of their trade and political
influence into Central Asia. The analogy thus presented could not fail
to impress me even further when I proceeded to examine the ruins of
Khara-khoto, the ‘Black Town’ which Colonel Kozloff, the distinguished
Russian explorer, had been the first European to visit during his
expedition of 1908–1909. There remained no doubt for me then that it
was identical with Marco Polo’s ‘City of Etzina.’ Of this we are told
in the great Venetian traveller’s narrative that it lay a twelve days’
ride from the city of Kan-chou, ‘towards the north on the verge of the
desert; it belongs to the Province of Tangut.’ All travellers bound for
Kara-koram, the old capital of the Mongols, had here to lay in victuals
for forty days in order to cross the great ‘desert which extends forty
days’ journey to the north, and on which you meet with no habitation
nor baiting place.’

“The position thus indicated was found to correspond exactly to that
of Khara-khoto, and the identification was completely borne out by
the antiquarian evidence brought to light. It soon showed me that
though the town may have suffered considerably, as local tradition
asserts, when Chingiz Khan with his Mongol army first invaded and
conquered Kansu from this side about 1226 A.D., yet it continued to be
inhabited down to Marco Polo’s time, and partially at least for more
than a century later. This was probably the case even longer with the
agricultural settlement for which it had served as a local centre, and
of which we traced extensive remains in the desert to the east and
north-east. But the town itself must have seen its most flourishing
times under Tangut or Hsi-hsia rule from the beginning of the eleventh
century down to the Mongol conquest.

“It was from this period, when Tibetan influence from the south seems
to have made itself strongly felt throughout Kansu, that most of the
Buddhist shrines and memorial Stupas dated, which filled a great
portion of the ruined town and were conspicuous also outside it. In one
of the latter Colonel Kozloff had made his notable find of Buddhist
texts and paintings. But a systematic search of this and other ruins
soon showed that the archæological riches of the site were by no
means exhausted. By a careful clearing of the débris which covered the
bases of Stupas and the interior of temple cellas we brought to light
abundant remains of Buddhist manuscripts and block prints, both in
Tibetan and the as yet very imperfectly known old Tangut language, as
well as plenty of interesting relievos in stucco or terra-cotta and
frescoes. The very extensive refuse heaps of the town yielded up a
large number of miscellaneous records on paper in the Chinese, Tangut,
and Uigur scripts, together with many remains of fine glazed pottery,
and of household utensils. Finds of Hsi-hsia coins, ornaments in stone
and metal, etc., were also abundant, particularly on wind-eroded ground.

“There was much to support the belief that the final abandonment of
the settlement was brought about by difficulties of irrigation.” (_A
Third Journey of Exploration in Central Asia_, 1913–16, _Geog. Jour._,
Aug.–Sept., 1916, pp. 38–39.)

M. Ivanov (_Isviestia_ Petrograd Academy, 1909) thinks that the ruined
city of Kara Khoto, a part at the Mongol period of the Yi-tsi-nai
circuit, could be its capital, and was at the time of the Si Hia and
the beginning of the Mongols, the town of Hei shui. It also confirms my
views.

Kozlov found (1908) in a stupa not far from Kara Khoto a large number
of Si Hia books, which he carried back to Petrograd, where they were
studied by Prof. A. IVANOV, _Zur Kenntniss der Hsi-hsia Sprache_ (_Bul.
Ac. Sc. Pet._, 1909, pp. 1221–1233). See _The Si-hia Language_, by B.
LAUFER (_T’oung Pao_, March, 1916, pp. 1–126).

XLVI., p. 226. “Originally the Tartars dwelt in the north on the
borders of Chorcha.”

Prof. Pelliot calls my attention that Ramusio’s text, f. 13 _v_, has:

doue sono molte pianure grandi....”

XLVI., p. 230.

                                TATAR.

“Mr. Rockhill is quite correct in his Turkish and Chinese dates for
the first use of the word _Tatar_, but it seems very likely that the
much older eponymous word _T’atun_ refers to the same people. The Toba
History says that in A.D. 258 the chieftain of that Tartar Tribe (not
yet arrived at imperial dignity) at a public durbar read a homily to
various chiefs, pointing out to them the mistake made by the Hiung-nu
(Early Turks) and ‘T’a-tun fellows’ (Early Mongols) in raiding his
frontiers. If we go back still further, we find the _After Han History_
speaking of the ‘Middle T’atun’; and a scholion tells us _not to
pronounce the final ‘n.’_ If we pursue our inquiry yet further back, we
find that _T’ah-tun_ was originally the name of a Sien-pi or Wu-hwan
(apparently Mongol) Prince, who tried to secure the _shen-yü_ ship for
himself, and that it gradually became (1) a title, (2) and the name of
a tribal division (see also the _Wei Chi_ and the _Early Han History_).
Both _Sien-pi_ and _Wu-hwan_ are the names of mountain haunts, and
at this very day part of the Russian Liao-tung railway is styled the
‘Sien-pi railway’ by the native Chinese newspapers.” (E. H. PARKER,

                            KARACATHAYANS.

“There seems to be no doubt that Kerman in South Persia is the city
to which the Kara-Cathayan refugee fled from China in 1124; for Major
Sykes, in his recent excellent work on Persia, actually mentions [p.
194] the Kuba Sabz, or ‘Green Dome,’ as having been (until destroyed
in 1886 by an earthquake) the most conspicuous building, and as
having also been the tomb of the Kara-Khitai Dynasty. The late Dr.
Bretschneider (_N. China B. R. As. Soc. Journal_, Vol. X., p. 101)
had imagined the Kara-Cathayan capital to be Kerminé, lying between
Samarcand and Bokhara (see _Asiatic Quart. Rev._ for Dec., 1900, ‘The
Cathayans’). Colonel Yule does not appear to be quite correct when he
states (p. 232) that ‘the Gurkhan himself is not described to have
extended his conquests into Persia,’ for the Chinese history of the
Cathayan or Liao Dynasties distinctly states that at Samarcand, where
the Cathayan remained for ninety days, the ‘King of the Mohammedans’
brought tribute to the emigrant, _who then went West as far as
K’i-r-man_, where he was proclaimed Emperor by his officers. This was
on the fifth day of the second moon in 1124, in the thirty-eighth
year of his age, and he then assumed the title of _Koh-r-han_” (E. H.

“In his note to Vol. I., p. 236, M. Cordier [read Mr. Rockhill],
who seems to have been misled by d’Avezac, confuses the Ch’ih-lêh
or T’ieh-lêh (who have been clearly proved to be identical with the
Tölös of the Turkish inscriptions) with the much later K’êh-lieh or
Keraits of Mongol history; at no period of Chinese history were the
Ch’ih-lêh called, as he supposes, _K’i-lê_, and therefore the Ch’ih-lêh
of the third century cannot possibly be identified with the K’ê-lieh
of the thirteenth. Besides, the ‘value’ of _lêh_ is ‘luck,’ whilst the
‘value’ of _lieh_ is ‘leet,’ if we use English sounds as equivalents to
illustrate Chinese etymology. It is remarkable that the Kin (Nüchen)
Dynasty in its Annals leaves no mention whatever of the Kerait tribe,
or of any tribe having an approximate name, although the _Yüan Shï_
states that the Princes of that tribe used to hold a Nüchen patent.
A solution of this unexplained fact may yet turn up.” (E. H. PARKER,

                        DEATH OF CHINGIZ KHAN.

“Gaubil’s statement that he was wounded in 1212 by a stray arrow, which
compelled him to raise the siege of Ta-t’ung Fu, is exactly borne out
by the _Yüan Shï_, which adds that in the seventh moon (August) of
1227 (shortly after the surrender of the Tangut King) the conqueror
died at the travelling-palace of Ha-la T’u on the Sa-li _stream_ at
the age of sixty-six (sixty-five by our reckoning). As less than a
month before he was present at Ts’ing-shui (lat. 34½°, long. 106½°),
and was even on his dying bed, giving instructions how to meet the
Nüchên army at T’ung-kwan (lat. 34½°, long. 110¼°), we may assume that
the place of his death was on the Upper Wei River near the frontiers
joining the modern Kan Suh and Shen Si provinces. It is true the Sa-li
_River_ (not stream) is thrice mentioned, and also the Sa-lê-chu
River, both in Mongolia; on the other hand, the Sa-li Ouigours are
frequently mentioned as living in West Kan Suh; so that we may take it
the word _Sali_ or _Sari_ was a not uncommon Turkish word. Palladius’
identification of _K’i-lien_ with ‘Kerulen’ I am afraid cannot be
entertained. The former word frequently occurs in the second century
B.C., and is stated to be a second Hiung-nu (Turkish) word for ‘sky’ or
‘heaven.’ At or about that date the Kerulen was known to the Chinese
as the Lu-kü River, and the geographies of the present dynasty clearly
identify it as such. The T’ien-Shan are sometimes called the K’i-lien
Shan, and the word _K’i-lien_ is otherwise well established along the
line of the Great Wall.” (E. H. PARKER, _Asiatic Quart. Rev._, Jan.,

this. If any man have a daughter who dies before marriage, and another

they do, making a regular contract! And when the contract papers are
made out they put them in the fire, in order (as they will have it)
that the parties in the other world may know the fact, and so look on
each other as man and wife. And the parents thenceforward consider
themselves sib to each other, just as if their children had lived and
married. Whatever may be agreed on between the parties as dowry, those
who have to pay it cause to be painted on pieces of paper and then put
these in the fire, saying that in that way the dead person will get all
the real articles in the other world.”

Mr. KUMAGUSU MINAKATA writes on the subject in _Nature_, Jan. 7, 1897,
pp. 224–5:

“As it is not well known whether or not there is a record of this
strange custom earlier than the beginning of the dynasty of Yuen, I was
in doubt whether it was originally common to the Chinese and Tartars
until I lately came across the following passage in _Tsoh-mung-luh_
(Brit. Mus. copy, 15297, _a_ 1, fol. 11–12), which would seem to decide
the question—‘In the North there is this custom. When a youth and a
girl of marriageable ages die before marriage, their families appoint
a match-maker to negotiate their nuptials, whom they call “Kwei-mei”
(_i.e._ “Match-Maker of Ghosts”). Either family hands over to another a
paper noticing all pre-requisites concerning the affair; and by names
of the parents of the intended couple asks a man to pray and divine;
and if the presage tells that the union is a lucky one, clothes and
ornaments are made for the deceased pair. Now the match-maker goes to
the burying-ground of the bridegroom, and, offering wine and fruits,
requests the pair to marry. There two seats are prepared on adjoining
positions, either of which having behind it a small banner more than
a foot long. Before the ceremony is consecrated by libation, the two
banners remain hanging perpendicularly and still; but when the libation
is sprinkled and the deceased couple are requested to marry, the
banners commence to gradually approach till they touch one another,
which shows that they are both glad of the wedlock. However, when one
of them dislikes another, it would happen that the banner representing
the unwilling party does not move to approach the other banner. In
case the couple should die too young to understand the matter, a dead
man is appointed as a tutor to the male defunct, and some effigies are
made to serve as the instructress and maids to the female defunct. The
dead tutor thus nominated is informed of his appointment by a paper
offered to him, on which are inscribed his name and age. After the
consummation of the marriage the new consorts appear in dreams to their
respective parents-in-law. Should this custom be discarded, the unhappy
defuncts might do mischief to their negligent relatives.... On every
occasion of these nuptials both families give some presents to the
match-maker (“Kwei-mei”), whose sole business is annually to inspect
the newly-deceased couples around his village, and to arrange their
weddings to earn his livelihood.’”

Mr. Kumagusu Minakata adds:

“The passage is very interesting, for, besides giving us a faithful
account of the particulars, which nowadays we fail to find elsewhere,
it bears testimony to the Tartar, and not Chinese, origin of this
practice. The author, Kang Yu-chi, describes himself to have visited
his old home in Northern China shortly after its subjugation by
the Kin Tartars in 1126 A.D.; so there is no doubt that among many
institutional novelties then introduced to China by the northern
invaders, Marriage of the Dead was so striking that the author did not
hesitate to describe it for the first time.

“According to a Persian writer, after whom Pétis de la Croix writes,
this custom was adopted by Jenghiz Kân as a means to preserve amity
amongst his subjects, it forming the subject of Article XIX. of his
Yasa promulgated in 1205 A.D. The same writer adds: ‘This custom is
still in use amongst the Tartars at this day, but superstition has
added more circumstances to it: they throw the contract of marriage
into the fire after having drawn some figures on it to represent the
persons pretended to be so marry’d, and some forms of beasts; and are
persuaded that all this is carried by the smoke to their children,
who thereupon marry in the other world’ (Pétis de la Croix, _Hist. of
Genghizcan_, trans. by P. Aubin, Lond., 1722, p. 86). As the Chinese
author does not speak of the burning of papers in this connection,
whereas the Persian writer speaks definitely of its having been added
later, it seems that the marriage of the dead had been originally a
Tartar custom, with which the well-known Chinese paper-burning was
amalgamated subsequently between the reigns of Genghiz and his grandson
Kúblái—under the latter Marco witnessed the customs already mingled,
still, perhaps, mainly prevailing amongst the Tartar descendants.”

B. Laufer, in the _Memoirs of the American Anthropological
Association_, Vol. IV., No. 2, 1917 (_The Reindeer and its
Domestication_), p. 107, has the following remarks: “Certainly this is
the reindeer. Yule is inclined to think that Marco embraces under this
tribal name in question characteristics belonging to tribes extending
far beyond the Mekrit, and which in fact are appropriate to the Tungus;
and continues that Rashid-eddin seems to describe the latter under the
name of Uriangkut of the Woods, a people dwelling beyond the frontier
of Barguchin, and in connection with whom he speaks of their reindeer
obscurely, as well as of their tents of birchbark, and their hunting
on snowshoes. As W. Radloff [_Die Jakutische Sprache, Mém. Ac. Sc.
Pet._, 1908, pp. 54–56] has endeavoured to show, the Wooland Uryangkit,
in this form mentioned by Rashid-eddin, should be looked upon as the
forefathers of the present Yakut. Rashid-eddin, further, speaks of
other Uryangkit, who are genuine Mongols, and live close together in
the Territory Barguchin Tukum, where the clans Khori, Bargut, and
Tumat, are settled. This region is east of Lake Baikal, which receives
the river Barguchin flowing out of Lake Bargu in an easterly direction.
The tribal name Bargut (_–t_ being the termination of the plural) is
surely connected with the name of the said river.”

on the grounds suggested in the various notes. In 1099 the new city
of Shen Chou was created by the Sung or ‘Manzi’ Dynasty on the site
of what had been called Ts’ing-t’ang. Owing to this region having for
many centuries belonged to independent Hia or Tangut, very little exact
information is obtainable from any Chinese history; but I think it
almost certain that the great central city of Shen Chou was the modern
Si-ning. Moreover, there was a very good reason for the invention
of this name, as this _Shen_ was the first syllable of the ancient
Shen-shen State of Lob Nor and Koko Nor, which, after its conquest by
China in 609, was turned into the Shen-shen prefecture; in fact, the
Sui Emperor was himself at Kam Chou or ‘Campichu’ when this very step

                        MONGOL IMPERIAL FAMILY.

“Marco Polo is correct in a way when he says Kúblái was the sixth
Emperor, for his father Tu li is counted as a _Divus_ (Jwei Tsung),
though he never reigned; just as his son Chin kin (Yü Tsung) is also
so counted, and under similar conditions. Chin kin was appointed to
the _chung shu_ and _shu-mih_ departments in 1263. He was entrusted
with extensive powers in 1279, when he is described as ‘heir apparent.’
In 1284 Yün Nan, Chagan-jang, etc., were placed under his direction.
His death is recorded in 1285. Another son, Numugan, was made Prince
of the Peking region (Pêh-p’ing) in 1266, and the next year a third
son, Hukaji, was sent to take charge of Ta-li, Chagan-jang, Zardandan,
etc. In 1272 Kúblái’s son, Mangalai, was made Prince of An-si, with
part of Shen Si as his appanage. One more son, named Ai-ya-ch’ih, is
mentioned in 1284, and in that year yet another, Tu kan, was made
Prince of Chên-nan, and sent on an expedition against Ciampa. In 1285
Essen Temur, who had received a _chung-shu_ post in 1283, is spoken
of as Prince of Yün Nan, and is stated to be engaged in Kara-jang; in
1286 he is still there, and is styled ‘son of the Emperor.’ I do not
observe in the Annals that Hukaji ever bore the title of Prince of Yün
Nan, or, indeed, any princely title. In 1287 Ai-ya-ch’ih is mentioned
as being at Shên Chou (Mukden) in connection with Kúblái’s ‘personally
conducted’ expedition against Nayen. In 1289 one more son, Géukju, was
patented Prince of Ning Yüan. In 1293 Kúblái’s _third son_, Chinkin,
received a posthumous title, and Chinkin’s son Temur was declared
heir-apparent to Kúblái.

“The above are the only sons of Kúblái whose names I have noticed in
the Annals. In the special table of Princes Numugan is styled Pêh-an
(instead of Pêh-p’ing) Prince. Aghrukji’s name appears in the table
(chap. 108, p. 107), but though he is styled Prince of Si-p’ing, he is
not there stated to be a son of Kúblái; nor in the note I have supplied
touching Tibet is he styled a _hwang-tsz_ or ‘imperial son.’ In the
table Hukaji is described as being in 1268 Prince of Yün Nan, a title
‘inherited in 1280 by Essen Temur.’ I cannot discover anything about
the other alleged sons in Yule’s note (Vol. I., p. 361). The Chinese
count Kúblái’s years as eighty, he having died just at the beginning
of 1294 (our February); this would make him seventy-nine at the very
outside, according to our mode of reckoning, or even seventy-eight if
he was born towards the end of a year, which indeed he was (eighth
moon). If a man is born on the last day of the year he is two years old
the very next day according to Chinese methods of counting, which, I
suppose, include the ten months which they consider are spent in the
womb.” (E. H. PARKER, _As. Quart. Rev._, Jan., 1904, pp. 137–139.)

“The cheeta is the offspring of a lioness, by a leopard that coerces
her, and, for this reason, cheetas are sterile like mules and all
other hybrids. No animal of the same size is as weighty as the cheeta.
It is the most somnolent animal on earth. The best are those that
are ‘hollow-bellied,’ roach backed, and have deep black spots on a
dark tawny ground, the spots on the back being close to each other;
that have the eyes bloodshot, small and narrow; the mouth ‘deep and
laughing’; broad foreheads; thick necks; the black line from the eyes
long; and the fangs far apart from each other. The fully mature animal
is more useful for sporting purposes than the cub; and the females are
better at hunting than are the males, and such is the case with all
beasts and birds of prey.”

as much as to say, ‘The Keepers of the Mastiff Dogs.’”

Dr. Laufer writes to me: “The word _chinuchi_ is a Mongol term derived
from Mongol _činoa_ (pronounced _čino_ or _čono_), which means ‘wolf,’
with the possessive suffix _-či_, meaning accordingly a ‘wolf-owner’
or ‘wolf-keeper.’ One of the Tibetan designations for the mastiff
is _čang-k’i_ (written _spyang-k’yi_), which signifies literally
‘wolf-dog.’ The Mongol term is probably framed on this Tibetan word.
The other explanations given by Yule (401–402) should be discarded.”

Prof. Pelliot writes to me: “J’incline à croire que les _Cunichi_ sont
à lire _Cuiuci_ et répondent au _kouei-tch’e_ ou _kouei-yeou-tch’e_,
‘censeurs,’ des textes chinois; les formes chinoises sont transcrites
du mongol et se rattachent au verbe _güyü_, ou _güyi_, ‘courir’; on
peut songer à restituer _güyükči_. Un _Ming-ngan_ (= _Minghan_), chef
des _kouei-tch’e_, vivait sous Kúblái et a sa biographie au ch. 135
du _Yuan Che_; d’autre part, peut-être faut-il lire, par déplacement
de deux points diacritiques, _Bayan güyükči_ dans Rashid ed-Din, ed.

XXIV., pp. 423, 430. “Bark of Trees, made into something like Paper, to
pass for Money over all his Country.”

Regarding Bretschneider’s statement, p. 430, Dr. B. Laufer writes to
me: “This is a singular error of Bretschneider. Marco Polo is perfectly
correct: not only did the Chinese actually manufacture paper from the
bark of the mulberry tree (_Morus alba_), but also it was this paper
which was preferred for the making of paper-money. Bretschneider is
certainly right in saying that paper is made from the _Broussonetia_,
but he is assuredly wrong in the assertion that paper is not made in
China from mulberry trees. This fact he could have easily ascertained
from S. Julien,[1] who alludes to mulberry tree paper twice, first, as
‘papier de racines et d’écorce de mûrier,’ and, second, in speaking
of the bark paper from _Broussonetia:_ ‘On emploie aussi pour le même
usage l’écorce d’_Hibiscus Rosa sinensis_ et de mûrier; ce dernier
papier sert encore à recueillir les graines de vers à soie.’ What is
understood by the latter process may be seen from Plate I. in Julien’s
earlier work on sericulture,[2] where the paper from the bark of the
mulberry tree is likewise mentioned.

“The _Chi p’u_, a treatise on paper, written by Su I-kien toward the
close of the tenth century, enumerates among the various sorts of paper
manufactured during his lifetime paper from the bark of the mulberry
tree (_sang p’i_) made by the people of the north.[3]

“Chinese paper-money of mulberry bark was known in the Islamic World
in the beginning of the fourteenth century; that is, during the Mongol
period. Accordingly it must have been manufactured in China during the
Yüan Dynasty. Ahmed Shibab Eddin, who died in Cairo in 1338 at the
age of 93, and left an important geographical work in thirty volumes,
containing interesting information on China gathered from the lips
of eye-witnesses, makes the following comment on paper-money, in the
translation of Ch. Schefer:[4]

“‘On emploie dans le Khita, en guise de monnaie, des morceaux d’un
papier de forme allongée fabriqué avec des filaments de mûriers sur
lesquels est imprimé le nom de l’empereur. Lorsqu’un de ces papiers
est usé, on le porte aux officiers du prince et, moyennant une perte
minime, on reçoit un autre billet en échange, ainsi que cela a lieu
dans nos hôtels des monnaies, pour les matières d’or et d’argent que
l’on y porte pour être converties en pièces monnayées.’

“And in another passage: ‘La monnaie des Chinois est faite de billets
fabriqués avec l’écorce du mûrier. Il y en a de grands et de petits....
On les fabrique avec des filaments tendres du mûrier et, après y avoir
apposé un sceau au nom de l’empereur, on les met en circulation.’[5]

“The banknotes of the Ming Dynasty were likewise made of mulberry pulp,
in rectangular sheets one foot long and six inches wide, the material
being of a greenish colour, as stated in the Annals of the Dynasty.[6]
It is clear that the Ming Emperors, like many other institutions,
adopted this practice from their predecessors, the Mongols. Klaproth[7]
is wrong in saying that the assignats of the Sung, Kin, and Mongols
were all made from the bark of the tree _ču (Broussonetia)_, and those
of the Ming from all sorts of plants.

“In the _Hui kiang chi_, an interesting description of Turkistan by
two Manchu officials, Surde and Fusambô, published in 1772,[8] the
following note headed ‘Mohamedan Paper’ occurs:

“‘There are two sorts of Turkistan paper, black and white, made from
mulberry bark, cotton and silk refuse equally mixed, resulting in a
coarse, thick, strong, and tough material. It is cut into small rolls
fully a foot long, which are burnished by means of stones, and then are
fit for writing.’

“Sir Aurel Stein[9] reports that paper is still manufactured from
mulberry trees in Khotan. Also J. Wiesner,[10] the meritorious
investigator of ancient papers, has included the fibres of _Morus alba_
and _M. nigra_ among the material to which his researches extended.

“Mulberry-bark paper is ascribed to Bengal in the _Si yang ch’ao kung
tien lu_ by Wu Kiën-hwang, published in 1520.[11]

“As the mulberry tree is eagerly cultivated in Persia in connection
with the silk industry, it is possible also that the Persian paper in
the banknotes of the Mongols was a product of the mulberry.[12] At any
rate, good Marco Polo is cleared, and his veracity and exactness have
been established again.”

                            VALUE OF GOLD.

“L’or valait quatre fois son poids d’argent au commencement de la
dynastie Ming (1375), sept ou huit fois sous l’empereur Wan-li de la
même dynastie (1574), et dix fois à la fin de la dynastie (1635); plus
de dix fois sous K’ang hi (1662); plus de vingt fois sous le règne
de K’ien long; dix-huit fois au milieu du règne de Tao-koang (1840),
quatorze fois au commencement du règne de Hien-fong (1850); dix-huit
fois en moyenne dans les années 1882–1883. En 1893, la valeur de l’or
augmenta considérablement et égala 28 fois celle de l’argent; en 1894,
32 fois; au commencement de 1895, 33 fois; mais il baissa un peu et à
la fin de l’année il valait seulement 30 fois plus.” (Pierre HOANG, _La

                            _CH’ING SIANG_.

Morrison, _Dict._, Pt. II, Vol. I., p. 70, says: “Chin-seang, a
Minister of State, was so called under the Ming Dynasty.” According to
Mr. E. H. Parker (_China Review_, XXIV., p. 101), _Ching Siang_ were
abolished in 1395.

In the quotation from the _Masálak al Absár_ instead of _Landjun_ (Lang
Chang), read _Landjun_ (_Lang Chung_).

XXXIII., pp. 447–8. “You must know, too, that the Tartars reckon their
years by twelves; the sign of the first year being the Lion, of the
second the Ox, of the third the Dragon, of the fourth the Dog, and so
forth up to the twelfth; so that when one is asked the year of his
birth he answers that it was in the year of the Lion (let us say),
on such a day or night, at such an hour, and such a moment. And the
father of a child always takes care to write these particulars down in
a book. When the twelve yearly symbols have been gone through, then
they come back to the first, and go through with them again in the same
succession.”

“Ce témoignage, writes Chavannes (_T’oung Pao_, 1906, p. 59), n’est
pas d’une exactitude rigoureuse, puisque les animaux n’y sont pas
nommés à leur rang; en outre, le lion y est substitué au tigre de
l’énumération chinoise; mais cette dernière différence provient sans
doute de ce que Marco Polo connaissait le cycle avec les noms mongols
des animaux; c’est le léopard dont il a fait le lion. Quoiqu’il en
soit, l’observation de Marco Polo est juste dans son ensemble et
d’innombrables exemples prouvent que le cycle des douze animaux
était habituel dans les pièces officielles émanant des chancelleries
impériales à l’époque mongole.”

XXXIII., p. 448.

                               PERSIAN.

With regard to the knowledge of Persian, the only oriental language
probably known by Marco Polo, Pelliot remarks (_Journ. Asiat._,
Mai-Juin, 1912, p. 592 n.): “C’est l’idée de Yule (cf. par exemple I.,
448), et je la crois tout à fait juste. On peut la fortifier d’autres
indices. On sait par exemple que Marco Polo substitue le lion au tigre
dans le cycle des douze animaux. M. Chavannes (_T’oung pao_, II., VII.,
59) suppose que ‘cette dernière différence provient sans doute de ce
que Marco Polo connaissait le cycle avec les noms mongols des animaux:
c’est le léopard dont il a fait le lion.’ Mais on ne voit pas pourquoi
il aurait rendu par ‘lion’ le turco-mongol _bars_, qui signifie
seulement ‘tigre.’ Admettons au contraire qu’il pense en persan: dans
toute l’Asie centrale, le persan شير _šīr_ a les deux sens de lion et
de tigre. De même, quand Marco Polo appelle la Chine du sud Manzi, il
est d’accord avec les Persans, par exemple avec Rachid ed-din, pour
employer l’expression usuelle dans la langue chinoise de l’époque,
c’est-à-dire Man-tseu; mais, au lieu de Manzi, les Mongols avaient
adopté un autre nom, Nangias, dont il n’y a pas trace dans Marco Polo.
On pourrait multiplier ces exemples.”

Dr. B. Laufer makes the following remarks to me: “Polo is quite right
in ascribing vines and wine to T’aï Yüan-fu in Shan Si, and is in this
respect upheld by contemporary Chinese sources. The _Yin shan cheng
yao_ written in 1330 by Ho Se-hui, contains this account[1]: ‘There are
numerous brands of wine: that coming from Qara-Khodja[2] (Ha-la-hwo)
is very strong, that coming from Tibet ranks next. Also the wines from
P’ing Yang and T’aï Yüan (in Shan Si) take the second rank. According
to some statements, grapes, when stored for a long time, will develop
into wine through a natural process. This wine is fragrant, sweet, and
exceedingly strong: this is the genuine grape-wine.’ _Ts’ao mu tse_,
written in 1378 par Ye Tse-k’i,[3] contains the following information:
‘Under the Yüan Dynasty grape-wine was manufactured in Ki-ning and
other circuits of Shan Si Province. In the eighth month they went to
the T’ai hang Mountain,[4] in order to test the genuine and adulterated
brands: the genuine kind when water is poured on it, will float; the
adulterated sort, when thus treated, will freeze.[5] In wine which has
long been stored, there is a certain portion which even in extreme
cold will never freeze, while all the remainder is frozen: this is the
spirit and fluid secretion of wine.[6] If this is drunk, the essence
will penetrate into a man’s armpits, and he will die. Wine kept for
two or three years develops great poison.’” For a detailed history of
grape-wine in China, see Laufer’s _Sino-Iranica_.

                                 VINE.

Chavannes (_Chancellerie chinoise de l’époque mongole_, II., pp. 66–68,
1908) has a long note on vine and grape wine-making in China, from
Chinese sources. We know that vine, according to Sze-ma Ts’ien, was
imported from Farghânah about 100 B.C. The Chinese, from texts in the
_T’ai p’ing yu lan_ and the _Yuan Kien lei han_, learned the art of
wine-making after they had defeated the King of Kao ch’ang (Turfan) in
640 A.D.

                   CHRISTIAN MONUMENT AT SI-NGAN FU.

The slab _King kiao pei_, bearing the inscription, was found, according
to Father Havret, 2nd Pt., p. 71, in the sub-prefecture of Chau Chi,
a dependency of Si-ngan fu, among ancient ruins. Prof. Pelliot says
that the slab was not found at Chau Chi, but in the western suburb
of Si-ngan, at the very spot where it was to be seen some years ago,
before it was transferred to the _Pei lin_, in fact at the place where
it was erected in the seventh century inside the monastery built by
Olopun. (_Chrétiens de l’Asie centrale, T’oung pao_, 1914, p. 625.)

In 1907, a Danish gentleman, Mr. Frits V. Holm, took a photograph of
the tablet as it stood outside the west gate of Si-ngan, south of the
road to Kan Su; it was one of five slabs on the same spot; it was
removed without the stone pedestal (a tortoise) into the city on the
2nd October 1907, and it is now kept in the museum known as the _Pei
lin_ (Forest of Tablets). Holm says it is ten feet high, the weight
being two tons; he tried to purchase the original, and failing this
he had an exact replica made by Chinese workmen; this replica was
deposited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the City of New York,
as a loan, on the 16th of June, 1908. Since, this replica was purchased
by Mrs. George Leary, of 1053, Fifth Avenue, New York, and presented by
this lady, through Frits Holm, to the Vatican. See the November number
(1916) of the _Boll. della R. Soc. Geog. Italiana_. “The Original
Nestorian Tablet of A.D. 781, as well as my replica, made in 1907,”
Holm writes, “are both carved from the stone quarries of Fu Ping Hien;
the material is a black, sub-granular limestone with small oolithes
scattered through it” (Frits V. Holm, _The Nestorian Monument_,
Chicago, 1900). In this pamphlet there is a photograph of the tablet as
it stands in the Pei lin.

Prof. Ed. Chavannes, who also visited Si-ngan in 1907, saw the
Nestorian Monument; in the album of his _Mission archéologique dans
la Chine Septentrionale_, Paris, 1909, he has given (Plate 445)
photographs of the five tablets, the tablet itself, the western gate
of the western suburb of Si-ngan, and the entrance of the temple _Kin

XLI., p. 29 n. The vocabulary _Hwei Hwei_ (Mahomedan) of the College
of Interpreters at Peking transcribes King chao from the Persian
Kin-chang, a name it gives to the Shen-si province. King chao was
called Ngan-si fu in 1277. (DEVÉRIA, _Epigraphie_, p. 9.) Ken jan comes
from Kin-chang = King-chao = Si-ngan fu.

Prof. Pelliot writes, _Bul. Ecole franç. Ext. Orient_, IV., July–Sept.,
1904, p. 29: “Cette note de M. Cordier n’est pas exacte. Sous les Song,
puis sous les Mongols jusqu’en 1277, Si-ngan fou fut appelé King-tchao
fou. Le vocabulaire _houei-houei_ ne transcrit pas ‘King-tchao du
persan kin-tchang,’ mais, comme les Persans appelaient alors Si-ngan
fou Kindjanfou (le Kenjanfu de Marco Polo), cette forme _persane_ est à
son tour transcrite phonétiquement en chinois Kin-tchang fou, sans que
les caractères choisis jouent là aucun rôle sémantique; Kin-tchang fou
n’existe pas dans la géographie chinoise. Quant à l’origine de la forme
persane, il est possible, mais non pas sûr, que ce soit King-tchao fou.
La forme ‘Quen-zan-fou,’ qu’un écolier chinois du Chen Si fournit à
M. von Richthofen comme le nom de Si-ngan fou au temps des Yuan, doit
avoir été fautivement recueillie. Il me paraît impossible qu’un Chinois
d’une province quelconque prononce _zan_ le caractère 兆 _tchao_.”

Ta T’sin_ and _Mubupa_ (Christian and _Mobed_ or Magian) _to return to

_Mubupa_ has no doubt been derived by the etymology _mobed_, but it
is faulty; it should be _Muhupa_. (PELLIOT, _Bul. Ecole franç. Ext.
Orient_, IV., July–Sept., 1904, p. 771.) Pelliot writes to me that
there is now no doubt that it is derived from _mu-lu hien_ and that it
must be understood as the “[religion of] the Celestial God of the Magi.”

XLIII., p. 32.

“The _chien-tao_, or ‘pillar road,’ mentioned, should be _chan-tao_, or
‘scaffolding road.’ The picture facing p. 50 shows how the shoring up
or scaffolding is effected. The word _chan_ is still in common use all
over the Empire, and in 1267 Kúblái ordered this identical road (‘Sz
Ch’wan _chan-tao_’) to be repaired. There are many such roads in Sz
Ch’wan besides the original one from Han-chung-Fu.” (E. H. PARKER, _As.

XLIV., p. 36. SINDAFU (Ch’êng tu fu).—Through the midst of this great
city runs a large river.... It is a good half-mile wide....

“It is probable that in the thirteenth century, when Marco Polo was
on his travels, the ‘great river a good half-mile wide,’ flowing past
Chengtu, was the principal stream; but in the present day that channel
is insignificant in comparison to the one which passes by Ta Hsien,
Yung-Chia Chong, and Hsin-Chin Hsien. Of course, these channels are
stopped up or opened as occasion requires. As a general rule, they
follow such contour lines as will allow gravitation to conduct the
water to levels as high as is possible, and when it is desired to
raise it higher than it will naturally flow, chain-pumps and enormous
undershot water-wheels of bamboo are freely employed. Water-power
is used for driving mills through the medium of wheels, undershot or
overshot, or turbines, as the local circumstances may demand.” (R.

“The story of the ‘three Kings’ of Sindafu is probably in this wise:
For nearly a century the Wu family (Wu Kiai, Wu Lin, and Wu Hi) had
ruled as semi-independent Sung or ‘Manzi’ Viceroys of Sz Ch’wan, but
in 1206 the last-named, who had fought bravely for the Sung (Manzi)
Dynasty against the northern Dynasty of the Nüchên Tartars (successors
to Cathay), surrendered to this same Kin or Golden Dynasty of Nüchêns
or Early Manchus, and was made King of Shuh (Sz Ch’wan). In 1236,
Ogdai’s son, K’wei-t’eng, effected the partial conquest of Shuh,
entering the capital, Ch’êng-tu Fu (Sindafu), towards the close of
the same year. But in 1259 Mangu in person had to go over part of the
same ground again. He proceeded up the rapids, and in the seventh moon
attacked Ch’ung K’ing, but about a fortnight later he died at a place
called Tiao-yü Shan, apparently near the Tiao-yü Ch’êng of my map (p.
175 of _Up the Yangtsze_, 1881), where I was myself in the year 1881.
Colonel Yule’s suggestion that Marco’s allusion is to the tripartite
Empire of China 1000 years previously is surely wide of the mark. The
‘three brothers’ were probably Kiai, Lin, and T’ing, and Wu Hi was the
son of Wu T’ing. An account of Wu Kiai is given in Mayers’ _Chinese
Reader’s Manual_.” (E. H. PARKER, _As. Quart. Rev._, Jan., 1904, pp.

Tch’eng Tu was the capital of the Kingdom of Shu. The first Shu Dynasty
was the Minor Han Dynasty which lasted from A.D. 221 to A.D. 263;
this Shu Dynasty was one of the Three Kingdoms (_San Kwo chi_); the
two others being Wei (A.D. 220–264) reigning at Lo Yang, and Wu (A.D.
222–277) reigning at Kien Kang (Nan King). The second was the Ts’ien
Shu Dynasty, founded in 907 by Wang Kien, governor of Sze Chw’an since
891; it lasted till 925, when it submitted to the Hau T’ang; in 933
the Hau T’ang were compelled to grant the title of King of Shu (Hau
Shu) to Mong Chi-siang, governor of Sze Chw’an, who was succeeded by
Mong Ch’ang, dethroned in 965; the capital was also Ch’eng Tu under
these two dynasties.

XLV., p. 44. No man of that country would on any consideration take to
wife a girl who was a maid; for they say a wife is nothing worth unless
she has been used to consort with men. And their custom is this, that
when travellers come that way, the old women of the place get ready,
and take their unmarried daughters or other girls related to them, and
go to the strangers who are passing, and make over the young women to
whomsoever will accept them; and the travellers take them accordingly
and do their pleasure; after which the girls are restored to the old
women who brought them....

Speaking of the Sifan village of Po Lo and the account given by Marco
Polo of the customs of these people, M. R. Logan JACK (_Back Blocks_,
1904, pp. 145–6) writes: “I freely admit that the good looks and modest
bearing of the girls were the chief merits of the performance in my
eyes. Had the _danseuses_ been scrubbed and well dressed, they would
have been a presentable body of _débutantes_ in any European ballroom.
One of our party, frivolously disposed, asked a girl (through an
interpreter) if she would marry him and go to his country. The reply,
‘I do not know you, sir,’ was all that propriety could have demanded in
the best society, and worthy of a pupil ‘finished’ at Miss Pinkerton’s
celebrated establishment.... Judging from our experience, no idea of
hospitalities of the kind [Marco’s experience] was in the people’s
minds.”

XLV., p. 45. Speaking of the people of Tibet, Polo says: “They are very
poorly clad, for their clothes are only of the skins of beasts, and of
canvas, and of buckram.”

Add to the note, I., p. 48, n. 5:—

“Au XIVᵉ siècle, le bougran [buckram] était une espèce de tissu de
lin: le meilleur se fabriquait en Arménie et dans le royaume de
Mélibar, s’il faut s’en rapporter à Marco Polo, qui nous apprend
que les habitants du Thibet, qu’il signale comme pauvrement vêtus,
l’étaient de canevas et de bougran, et que cette dernière étoffe se
fabriquait aussi dans la province d’Abasce. Il en venait également de
l’île de Chypre. Sorti des manufactures d’Espagne ou importé dans le
royaume, à partir de 1442, date d’une ordonnance royale publiée par
le P. Saez, le bougran le plus fin payait soixante-dix maravédis de
droits, sans distinction de couleur” (FRANCISQUE-MICHEL, _Recherches
sur le commerce, la fabrication et l’usage des étoffes de soie, d’or et
d’argent_.... II., 1854, pp. 33–4). Passage mentioned by Dr. Laufer.

Referring to Dr. E. Bretschneider, Prof. E. H. Parker gives the
following notes in the _Asiatic Quart. Review_, Jan., 1904, p. 131:
“In 1251 Ho-êrh-t’ai was appointed to the command of the Mongol and
Chinese forces advancing on Tibet (T’u-fan). [In my copy of the _Yüan
Shï_ there is no entry under the year 1254 such as that mentioned by
Bretschneider; it may, however, have been taken by Palladius from
some other chapter.] In 1268 Mang-ku-tai was ordered to invade the
Si-fan (outer Tibet) and _Kien-tu_ [Marco’s Caindu] with 6000 men.
Bretschneider, however, omits Kien-tu, and also omits to state that
in 1264 eighteen Si-fan clans were placed under the superintendence
of the _an-fu-sz_ (governor) of An-si Chou, and that in 1265 a reward
was given to the troops of the decachiliarch Hwang-li-t’a-rh for their
services against the T’u-fan, with another reward to the troops under
Prince Ye-suh-pu-hwa for their successes against the Si-fan. Also that
in 1267 the Si-fan chieftains were encouraged to submit to Mongol
power, in consequence of which A-nu-pan-ti-ko was made Governor-General
of Ho-wu and other regions near it. Bretschneider’s next item after
the doubtful one of 1274 is in 1275, as given by Cordier, but he omits
to state that in 1272 Mang-ku-tai’s eighteen clans and other T’u-fan
troops were ordered in hot haste to attack Sin-an Chou, belonging to
the Kien-tu prefecture; and that a post-station called Ning-ho Yih was
established on the T’u-fan and Si-Ch’wan [= Sz Ch’wan] frontier. In
1275 a number of Princes, including Chi-pi T’ie-mu-r, and Mang-u-la,
Prince of An-si, were sent to join the Prince of Si-p’ing [Kúblái’s
son] Ao-lu-ch’ih in his expedition against the Tu-fan. In 1276 all
Si-fan bonzes (lamas) were forbidden to carry arms, and the Tu-fan city
of Hata was turned into Ning-yüan Fu [as it now exists]; garrisons
and civil authorities were placed in Kien-tu and Lo-lo-sz [the Lolo
country]. In 1277 a Customs station was established at Tiao-mên and
Li-Chou [Ts’ing-k’i Hien in Ya-chou Fu] for the purposes of Tu-fan
trade. In 1280 more Mongol troops were sent to the Li Chou region,
and a special officer was appointed for T’u-fan [Tibetan] affairs
at the capital. In 1283 a high official was ordered to print the
official documents connected with the _süan-wei-sz_ [governorship]
of T’u-fan. In 1288 six provinces, including those of Sz Chw’an
and An-si, were ordered to contribute financial assistance to the
_süan-wei-shï_ [governor] of U-sz-tsang [the indigenous name of Tibet
proper]. Every year or two after this, right up to 1352, there are
entries in the Mongol Annals amply proving that the conquest of Tibet
under the Mongols was not only complete, but fully narrated; however,
there is no particular object in carrying the subject here beyond
the date of Marco’s departure from China. There are many mentions of
Kien-tu (which name dates from the Sung Dynasty) in the _Yüan-shï_;
it is the Kien-ch’ang Valley of to-day, with capital at Ning-yüan,
as clearly marked on Bretschneider’s Map. Baber’s suggestion of the
_Chan-tui_ tribe of Tibetans is quite obsolete, although Baber was
one of the first to explore the region in person. A petty tribe like
the _Chan-tui_ could never have given name to _Caindu_; besides, both
initials and finals are impossible, and the _Chan-tui_ have never lived
there. I have myself met Si-fan chiefs at Peking; they may be described
roughly as Tibetans _not under_ the Tibetan Government. The T’u-fan,
T’u-po, or Tubot, were the Tibetans _under Tibetan rule_, and they are
now usually styled ‘Si-tsang’ by the Chinese. Yaci [Ya-ch’ih, Ya-ch’ï]
is frequently mentioned in the _Yüan-shï_, and the whole of Devéria’s
quotation given by Cordier on p. 72 appears there [chap. 121, p. 5],
besides a great deal more to the point, without any necessity for
consulting the _Lei pien_. Cowries, under the name of _pa-tsz_, are
mentioned in both Mongol and Ming history as being in use for money in
Siam and Yung-ch’ang [Vociam]. The porcelain coins which, as M. Cordier
quotes from me on p. 74, I myself saw current in the Shan States or
Siam about ten years ago, were of white China, with a blue figure, and
about the size of a Keating’s cough lozenge, but thicker. As neither
form of the character _pa_ appears in any dictionary, it is probably a
foreign word only locally understood. Regarding the origin of the name
Yung-ch’ang, the discussions upon p. 105 are no longer necessary; in
the eleventh moon of 1272 [say about January 1, 1273] Kúblái ‘presented
the name Yung-ch’ang to the new city built by Prince Chi-pi T’ie-mu-r.’”

XLVI., p. 49. They have also in this country [Tibet] plenty of fine
woollens and other stuffs, and many kinds of spices are produced there
which are never seen in our country.

Dr. Laufer draws my attention to the fact that this translation does
not give exactly the sense of the French text, which runs thus:

“Et encore voz di qe en ceste provence a gianbelot [camelot] assez et
autres dras d’or et de soie, et hi naist maintes especes qe unques ne
furent veue en nostre païs.” (_Ed. Soc. de Géog._, Chap. cxvi., p. 128.)

In the Latin text (_Ibid._, p. 398), we have:

“In ista provincia sunt giambelloti satis et alii panni de sirico et
auro; et ibi nascuntur multæ species quæ nunquam fuerunt visæ in
nostris contractis.”

Francisque-Michel (_Recherches_, II., p. 44) says: “Les Tartares
fabriquaient aussi à Aias de très-beaux camelots de poil de chameau,
que l’on expédiait pour divers pays, et Marco Polo nous apprend que
cette denrée était fort abondante dans le Thibet. Au XVᵉ siècle, il en
venait de l’île de Chypre.”

XLVII., pp. 50, 52.

                     WILD OXEN CALLED _BEYAMINI_.

Dr. Laufer writes to me: “Yule correctly identifies the ‘wild oxen’ of
Tibet with the gayal (_Bos gavaeus_), but I do not believe that his
explanation of the word _beyamini_ (from an artificially constructed
_buemini_ = Bohemian) can be upheld. Polo states expressly that these
wild oxen are called _beyamini_ (scil. by the natives), and evidently
alludes to a native Tibetan term. The gayal is styled in Tibetan
_ba-men_ (or _ba-man_), derived from _ba_ (‘cow’), a diminutive form of
which is _beu_. Marco Polo appears to have heard some dialectic form of
this word like _beu-men_ or _beu-min_.”

XLVIII., p. 70.

                         KIUNG TU AND KIEN TU.

Kiung tu or Kiang tu is Caindu in Sze-Ch’wan; Kien tu is in Yun Nan.
Cf. PELLIOT, _Bul. Ecole franç. Ext. Orient_, July–Sept, 1904, p. 771.
Caindu or Ning Yuan was, under the Mongols, a dependency of Yun Nan,
not of Sze Ch’wan. (PELLIOT.)

XLVIII., p. 72. The name _Karájáng_. “The first element was the Mongol
or Turki _Kárá_.... Among the inhabitants of this country some are
black, and others are white; these latter are called by the Mongols
_Chaghán-Jáng_ (‘White Jang’). Jang has not been explained; but
probably it may have been a Tibetan term adopted by the Mongols, and
the colours may have applied to their clothing.”

Dr. Berthold Laufer, of Chicago, has a note on the subject in the
_Journal of the Royal Asiatic Soc._, Oct., 1915, pp. 781–4: “M. Pelliot
(_Bul. Ecole franç. Ext. Orient_, IV., 1904, p. 159) proposed to
regard the unexplained name _Jang_ as the Mongol transcription of
_Ts’uan_, the ancient Chinese designation of the Lo-lo, taken from the
family name of one of the chiefs of the latter; he gave his opinion,
however, merely as an hypothesis which should await confirmation.
I now believe that Yule was correct in his conception, and that,
in accordance with his suggestion, _Jang_ indeed represents the
phonetically exact transcription of a Tibetan proper name. This is the
Tibetan _ạ Jaṅ_ or _ạ Jaṇs_ (the prefixed letter _ạ_ and the optional
affix _-s_ being silent, hence pronounced _Jang_ or _Djang_), of
which the following precise definition is given in the _Dictionnaire
tibétain-latin français par les Missionnaires Catholiques du Tibet_ (p.
351): ‘Tribus et regionis nomen in N.-W. provinciae Sinarum Yun-nan,
cuius urbs principalis est Sa-t’am seu Ly-kiang fou. Tribus vocatur
Mosso a Sinensibus et Nashi ab ipsismet incolis.’ In fact, as here
stated, _Jaⁿ_ or _Jang_ is the Tibetan designation of the Moso and the
territory inhabited by them, the capital of which is Li-kiang-fu. This
name is found also in Tibetan literature....”

XLVIII., p. 74, n. 2. One thousand Uighúr families (_hou_) had been
transferred to Karajáng in 1285. (_Yuan shi_, ch. 13, 8_vᵒ_, quoted by
PELLIOT.)

L., pp. 85–6. Zardandan. “The country is wild and hard of access, full
of great woods and mountains which ’tis impossible to pass, the air in
summer is so impure and bad; and any foreigners attempting it would die
for certain.”

“An even more formidable danger was the resolution of our ‘permanent’
(as distinguished from ‘local’) soldiers and mafus, of which we were
now apprised, to desert us in a body, as they declined to face the
malaria of the Lu-Kiang Ba, or Salwen Valley. We had, of course, read
in Gill’s book of this difficulty, but as we approached the Salwen
we had concluded that the scare had been forgotten. We found, to our
chagrin, that the dreaded ‘Fever Valley’ had lost none of its terrors.
The valley had a bad name in Marco Polo’s day, in the thirteenth
century, and its reputation has clung to it ever since, with all the
tenacity of Chinese traditions. The Chinaman of the district crosses
the valley daily without fear, but the Chinaman from a distance _knows_
that he will either die or his wife will prove unfaithful. If he is
compelled to go, the usual course is to write to his wife and tell her
that she is free to look out for another husband. Having made up his
mind that he will die, I have no doubt that he often dies through sheer
funk.” (R. Logan JACK, _Back Blocks of China_, 1904, p. 205.)

                 CONCERNING THE PROVINCE OF ZARDANDAN.

We read in Huber’s paper already mentioned (_Bul. Ecole franç. Ext.
Orient_, Oct.–Dec., 1909, p. 665): “The second month of the twelfth
year (1275), Ho T’ien-tsio, governor of the Kien Ning District, sent
the following information: ‘A-kouo of the Zerdandan tribe, knows three
roads to enter Burma, one by T’ien pu ma, another by the P’iao tien,
and the third by the very country of A-kouo; the three roads meet at
the ‘City of the Head of the River’ [Kaung si] in Burma.’” A-kouo,
named elsewhere A-ho, lived at Kan-ngai. According to Huber, the
Zardandan road is the actual caravan road to Bhamo on the left of the
Nam Ti and Ta Ping; the second route would be by the T’ien ma pass and
Nam hkam, the P’iao tien route is the road on the right bank of the Nam
Ti and the Ta Ping leading to Bhamo _viâ_ San Ta and Man Waing.

The _Po Yi_ and _Ho Ni_ tribes are mentioned in the _Yuan Shi_, s.a.
1278. (PELLIOT.)

Mr. H. A. OTTEWILL tells me in a private note that the Kachins or
Singphos did not begin to reach Burma in their emigration from Tibet
until last century or possibly this century. They are not to be found
east of the Salwen River.

                               COUVADE.

There is a paper on the subject in the _Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_
(1911, pp. 546–63) by Hugo Kunicke, _Das sogennante “Männerkindbett,”_
with a bibliography not mentioning Yule’s _Marco Polo_, Vinson,
etc. We may also mention: _De la “Covada” en España_. Por el Prof.

I quoted Prof. E. H. Parker (_China Review_, XIV., p. 359), who wrote
that the “_Langszi_ are evidently the _Szi lang_, one of the six
_Chao_, but turned upside down.” Prof. Pelliot (_Bul. Ecole franç.
Ext. Orient_, IV., July–Sept., 1904, p. 771) remarks: “Mr. Parker is
entirely wrong. The _Chao_ of Shi-lang, which was annexed by Nan Chao
during the eighth century, was in the western part of Yun Nan, not in
Kwei chau; we have but little information on the subject.” He adds:
“The custom of Couvade is confirmed for the Lao of Southern China
by the following text of the _Yi wu chi_ of Fang Ts’ien-li, dating
at least from the time of the T’ang dynasty: ‘When a Lao woman of
Southern China has a child, she goes out at once. The husband goes to
bed exhausted, like a woman giving suck. If he does not take care, he
becomes ill. The woman has no harm.’”

L., pp. 91–95.

Under the title of _The Couvade or “Hatching,”_ John Cain writes from
Dumagudem, 31st March, 1874, to the _Indian Antiquary_, May, 1874, p.
151:

“In the districts in South India in which Telugu is spoken, there is
a wandering tribe of people called the Erukalavandlu. They generally
pitch their huts, for the time being, just outside a town or village.
Their chief occupations are fortune-telling, rearing pigs, and making
mats. Those in this part of the Telugu country observe the custom
mentioned in Max Müller’s _Chips from a German Workshop_, Vol. II.,
pp. 277–284. Directly the woman feels the birth-pangs, she informs
her husband, who immediately takes some of her clothes, puts them
on, places on his forehead the mark which the women usually place on
theirs, retires into a dark room where is only a very dim lamp, and
lies down on the bed, covering himself up with a long cloth. When the
child is born, it is washed and placed on the cot beside the father.
Assafœtida, _jaggery_, and other articles are then given, not to the
mother, but to the father. During the days of ceremonial uncleanness
the man is treated as the other Hindus treat their women on such
occasions. He is not allowed to leave his bed, but has everything
needful brought to him.”

Mr. John Cain adds (_l.c._, April, 1879, p. 106): “The women are
called ‘hens’ by their husbands, and the male and female children ‘cock
children’ and ‘hen children’ respectively.”

LI., p. 99 n. “M. Garnier informs me that _Mien Kwé_ or _Mien Tisong_
is the name always given in Yun Nan to that kingdom.”

_Mien Tisong_ is surely faulty, and must likely be corrected in _Mien
Chung_, proved especially at the Ming Period. (PELLIOT, _Bul. Ecole
franç. Ext. Orient_, IV., July–Sept, 1904, p. 772.)

                     WAR AGAINST THE KING OF MIEN.

The late Edouard HUBER of Hanoi, writing from Burmese sources,
throws new light on this subject: “In the middle of the thirteenth
century, the Burmese kingdom included Upper and Lower Burma, Arakan
and Tenasserim; besides the Court of Pagan was paramount over several
feudatory Shan states, until the valleys of the Yunnanese affluents
of the Irawadi to the N.E., and until Zimmé at the least to the E.
Narasīhapati, the last king of Pagan who reigned over the whole of
this territory, had already to fight the Talaings of the Delta and the
governor of Arakan who wished to be independent, when, in 1271, he
refused to receive Kúblái’s ambassadors who had come to call upon him
to recognize himself as a vassal of China. The first armed conflict
took place during the spring of 1277 in the Nam Ti valley; it is the
battle of Nga-çaung-khyam of the Burmese Chronicles, related by Marco
Polo, who, by mistake, ascribes to Nasr ed-Din the merit of this
first Chinese victory. During the winter of 1277–78, a second Chinese
expedition with Nasr ed-Din at its head ended with the capture of
Kaung sin, the Burmese stronghold commanding the defile of Bhamo. The
_Pagan Yazawin_ is the only Burmese Chronicle giving exactly the spot
of this second encounter. During these two expeditions, the invaders
had not succeeded in breaking through the thick veil of numerous small
thai principalities which still stand to-day between Yun Nan and Burma
proper. It was only in 1283 that the final crush took place, when a
third expedition, whose chief was Siang-wu-ta-eul (Singtaur), retook
the fort of Kaung sin and penetrated more into the south in the Irawadi
Valley, but without reaching Pagan. King Narasīhapati evacuated Pagan
before the impending advancing Chinese forces and fled to the Delta.
In 1285 parleys for the establishment of a Chinese Protectorship were
begun; but in the following year, King Narasīhapati was poisoned at
Prome by his own son Sīhasūra. In 1287, a fourth Chinese expedition,
with Prince Ye-sin Timur at its head, reached at last Pagan, having
suffered considerable losses.... A fifth and last Chinese expedition
took place during the autumn of 1300 when the Chinese army went down
the Irawadi Valley and besieged Myin-Saing during the winter of
1300–1301. The Mongol officers of the staff having been bribed the
siege was raised.” (_Bul. Ecole franç. Extrême-Orient_, Oct.–Dec.,
1909, pp. 679–680; cf. also p. 651 _n._)

633–680.—VISDELOU, _Rev. Ext. Orient_, II., pp. 72–88.

LIII.–LIV., pp. 106–108. “After leaving the Province of which I have
been speaking [Yung ch’ang] you come to a great Descent. In fact you
ride for two days and a half continually down hill.... After you
have ridden those two days and a half down hill, you find yourself
in a province towards the south which is pretty near India, and this
province is called AMIEN. You travel therein for fifteen days.... And
when you have travelled those 15 days ... you arrive at the capital
city of this Province of Mien, and it also is called AMIEN....”

I owe the following valuable note to Mr. Herbert Allan OTTEWILL,
H.M.’s Vice-Consul at T’eng Yueh (11th October, 1908):

“The indications of the route are a great descent down which you ride
continually for two days and a half towards the south along the main
route to the capital city of Amien.

“It is admitted that the road from Yung Ch’ang to T’eng Yueh is not the
one indicated. Before the Hui jen Bridge was built over the Salween in
1829, there can be no doubt that the road ran to Ta tu k’ou—great ferry
place—which is about six miles below the present bridge. The distance
to both places is about the same, and can easily be accomplished in two
days.

“The late Mr. Litton, who was Consul here for some years, once stated
that the road to La-mêng on the Salween was almost certainly the one
referred to by Marco Polo as the great descent to the kingdom of Mien.
His stages were from Yung Ch’ang: (1) Yin wang (? Niu wang); (2) P’ing
ti; (3) Chen an so; (4) Lung Ling. The Salween was crossed on the third
day at La-mêng Ferry. Yung Ch’ang is at an altitude of about 5,600
feet; the Salween at the Hui jen Bridge is about 2,400, and probably
drops 200–300 feet between the bridge and La-mêng. Personally I have
only been along the first stage to Niu Wang, 5,000 feet; and although
aneroids proved that the highest point on the road was about 6,600, I
can easily imagine a person not provided with such instruments stating
that the descent was fairly gradual. From Niu Wang there must be a
steady drop to the Salween, probably along the side of the stream which
drains the Niu Wang Plain.

“La-mêng and Chen an so are in the territory of the Shan Sawbwa of Mang
Shih [Möng Hkwan].”

“It is also a well-known fact that the Shan States of Hsen-wi (in
Burma) and Meng mao (in China) fell under Chinese authority at an early
date. Mr. E. H. Parker, quoted by Sir G. Scott in the _Upper Burma
Gazetteer_, states: ‘During the reign of the Mongol Emperor Kúblái a
General was sent to punish Annam and passed through this territory or
parts of it called Meng tu and Meng pang,’ and secured its submission.
In the year 1289 the Civil and Military Governorship of Muh Pang was
established. Muh Pang is the Chinese name of Hsen-wi.

“Therefore the road from Yung Ch’ang to La-mêng fulfils the conditions
of a great descent, riding two and a half days continually down hill
finding oneself in a (Shan) Province to the south, besides being on a
well-known road to Burma, which was probably in the thirteenth century
the only road to that country.

“Fifteen days from La-mêng to Tagaung or Old Pagan is not an impossible
feat. Lung Ling is reached in 1½ days, Keng Yang in four, and it is
possible to do the remaining distance about a couple of hundred miles
in eleven days, making fifteen in all.

“I confess I do not see how any one could march to Pagan in Latitude
21° 13′ in fifteen days.”

LIV., p. 113.

                           NGA-TSHAUNG-GYAN.

According to the late E. HUBER, Ngan chen kue is not Nga-çaung-khyam,
but Nga Singu, in the Mandalay district. The battle took place, not
in the Yung Ch’ang plain, but in the territory of the Shan Chief of
Nan-tien. The official description of China under the Ming (_Ta Ming yi
t’ung che_, k. 87, 38 vᵒ) tells us that Nan-tien before its annexation
by Kúblái Khan, bore the name of Nan Sung or Nang Sung, and to-day the

Long Reed System, derives its name from the city Ts’ang chou, on the
Grand Canal (south of T’ientsin), once so called. In 1285 Kúblái Khan
‘once more divided the Ho-kien (Chih-li) and Shan Tung interests,’
which, as above explained, are really one in working principle. There
is now a First Class Commissary at T’ientsin, with sixteen subordinates,

position is Ngan tung which was a _chou_ (_giu_) in the Sung and Yuan

“It is evident that Tiju and Yanju have been correctly identified as
Taichow and Yangchow. I cannot agree with Mr. Kingsmill, however, in
identifying Tinju as Ichin-hien on the Great River. It is not probable
that Polo would mention Ichin twice, once before reaching Yangchow and
once after describing Yangchow. I am inclined to believe that Tinju
is Hsien-nü-miao 仙女廟, a large market-place which has close connection
both with Taichow and Yangchow. It is also an important place for the
collection of the revenue on salt, as Polo notices. This identification
of Tinju with Hsien-nü-miao would clear up any uncertainty as to Polo’s
journey, and would make a natural route for Polo to take from Kao yu
to Yangchow if he wished to see an important place between these two
cities.”

not ‘A-la-wa-ting of Mu-fa-li and Ysemain of Huli or Hiulie,’ but
A-la-pu-tan of Mao-sa-li and Y-sz-ma-yin of Shih-la. Shih-la is Shiraz,
the Serazy of Marco Polo, and Mao-sa-li is Mosul. Bretschneider cites
the facts in his _Mediæval Notes_, and seems to have used another
edition, giving the names as A-lao-wa-ting of Mu-fa-li and Y-sz-ma-yin

According to the _Yuen Shi_ and Devéria, _Journ. Asiat._, Nov.–Dec.,
1896, 432, in 1229 and 1241, when Okkodai’s army reached the country
of the Aas (Alans), their chief submitted at once and a body of one
thousand Alans were kept for the private guard of the Great Khan;
Mangu enlisted in his bodyguard half the troops of the Alan Prince,
Arslan, whose younger son Nicholas took a part in the expedition of
the Mongols against Karajang (Yun Nan). This Alan imperial guard was
still in existence in 1272, 1286, and 1309, and it was divided into two
corps with headquarters in the Ling pei province (Karakorúm). See also
Bretschneider, _Mediæval Researches_, II., pp. 84–90.

The massacre of the Alans took place, according to Chinese sources,

of the city, Hung Fu, after making a faint submission, got the Alans
drunk at night and had them slaughtered. Cf. PELLIOT, _Chrétiens d’Asie

Dowager to the Court of Kúblái after the fall of Hang Chau in 1276;
the diary was written by Yen Kwang-ta, a native of Shao Hing, who was
attached to the party.

The Rev. A. C. Moule in his notes writes, p. 411: “The connexion
between Hu-chou and Hang-chou is very intimate, and the north suburb
of the latter, the Hu-shu, was known in Marco Polo’s day as the
Hu-chou shih. The identification of Vughin with Wu-chiang is fairly
satisfactory, but it is perhaps worth while to point out that there
is a place called Wu chên about fifty _li_ north of Shih-mên; and for
Ciangan there is a tempting place called Ch’ang-an chên just south of
Shih-mên on a canal which was often preferred to the T’ang-hsi route

Chinese Atlas in the Magliabecchian Library.

The Rev. A. C. MOULE has devoted a long note to this Atlas in the
_Journ. R. As. Soc._, July, 1919, pp. 393–395. He has come to the
conclusion that the Atlas is no more nor less than the _Kuang yü t’u_,
and that it seems that _Camse_ stands neither for Ching-shih, as Yule
thought, nor for Hang chau as he, Moule, suggested in 1917, but simply
for the province of Kiangsi. (_A Note on the Chinese Atlas in the
Magliabecchian Library, with reference to Kinsay in Marco Polo_.)

Mr. P. von Tanner, Commissioner of Customs at Hang chau, wrote in 1901
in the _Decennial Reports, 1892–1901, of the Customs_, p. 4: “While
Hangchow owes its fame to the lake on the west, it certainly owes
its existence towards the south-west to the construction of the sea
wall, called by the Chinese by the appropriate name of bore wall. The
erection of this sea wall was commenced about the year A.D. 915, by
Prince Ts’ien Wu-su; it extends from Hang Chau to Chuan sha, near the
opening of the Hwang pu.... The present sea wall, in its length of 180
miles, was built. The wall is a stupendous piece of work, and should
take an equal share of fame with the Grand Canal and the Great Wall
of China, as its engineering difficulties were certainly infinitely
greater.... The fact that Marco Polo does not mention it shows almost
conclusively that he never visited Hang Chau, but got his account from
a Native poet. He must have taken it, besides, without the proverbial
grain of salt, and without eliminating the over-numerous ‘thousands’
and ‘myriads’ prompted less by facts than by patriotic enthusiasm and
poetical licence.”

called _Hwei Hwei k’iao_ (Bridge of the Mohamedans) or _Hwei Hwei Sin

Shan k’iao_ (Bridge of Accumulated Wealth); it is situated between
the _Tsien k’iao_ on the south and the _Fung lo k’iao_ on the north.
Near the _Tsi Shan k’iao_ was a mosk, and near the _Tsien k’iao_, at
the time of the Yuen, there existed Eight Pavilions (_Pa kien lew_)
inhabited by wealthy Mussulmans. Mohamedans from Arabia and Turkestan
were sent by the Yuen to Hang-chau; they had prominent noses, did not
eat pork, and were called _So mu chung_ (Coloured-eye race). VISSIÈRE,

Dr. Laufer writes to me: “Yule’s identification with a species of
_Gardenia_ is all right, although this is not peculiar to Fu Kien.
Another explanation, however, is possible. In fact, the Chinese speak
of a certain variety of saffron peculiar to Fu Kien. The _Pen ts’ao
kang mu shi i_ (Ch. 4, p. 14 b) contains the description of a ‘native
saffron’ (_t’u hung hwa_, in opposition to the ‘Tibetan red flower’ or
genuine saffron) after the Continued Gazetteer of Fu Kien, as follows:
‘As regards the native saffron, the largest specimens are seven or
eight feet high. The leaves are like those of the p’i-p’a (_Eriobotrya
japonica_), but smaller and without hair. In the autumn it produces
a white flower like a grain of maize (_Su-mi, Zea mays_). It grows
in Fu Chou and Nan Ngen Chou (now Yang Kiang in Kwang Tung) in the
mountain wilderness. That of Fu Chou makes a fine creeper, resembling
the _fu-yung_ (_Hibiscus mutabilis_), green above and white below, the
root being like that of the _ko_ (_Pachyrhizus thunbergianus_). It is
employed in the pharmacopeia, being finely chopped for this purpose
and soaked overnight in water in which rice has been scoured; then
it is soaked for another night in pure water and pounded: thus it is
ready for prescriptions.’ This plant, as far as I know, has not yet
been identified, but it may well be identical with Polo’s saffron of Fu
Kien.”

                    Tarradale, Muir of Ord, Ross-shire, May 10, 1915.

In a letter lately received from my cousin Mr. George Udny Yule (St.
John’s College, Cambridge) he makes a suggestion which seems to me both
probable and interesting. As he is at present too busy to follow up the
question himself, I have asked permission to publish his suggestion in
_The Athenæum_, with the hope that some reader skilled in mediæval
French and Italian may be able to throw light on the subject.

Mr. Yule writes as follows:—

  “The reference [to these fowls] in ‘Marco Polo’ (p. 226 of the last
  edition; not p. 126 as stated in the index) is a puzzle, owing to
  the statement that they are _black_ all over. A black has, I am
  told, been recently created, but the common breed is white, as
  stated in the note and by Friar Odoric.

  “It has occurred to me as a possibility that what Marco Polo may
  have meant to say was that they were _black all through_, or some
  such phrase. The flesh of these fowls is deeply pigmented, and
  looks practically black; it is a feature that is very remarkable,
  and would certainly strike any one who saw it. The details that
  they ‘lay eggs just like our fowls,’ _i.e._, not pigmented, and are
  ‘very good to eat,’ are facts that would naturally deserve especial
  mention in this connexion. Mr. A. D. Darbishire (of Oxford and
  Edinburgh University) tells me that is quite correct: the flesh
  look horrid, but it is quite good eating. Do any texts suggest the
  possibility of such a reading as I suggest?”

The references in the above quotation are, of course, to my father’s
version of Marco Polo. That his nephew should make this interesting
little contribution to the subject would have afforded him much
gratification.

“I may observe that the _Pêh Shï_ (or ‘Northern Dynasties History’)

fifth century of our era. There can be no mistake about the meaning of
the words _sha-t’ang_, which are still used both in China and Japan
(_sa-tō_). The ‘History of the T’ang Dynasty,’ in its chapter on
Magadha, says that in the year 627 the Chinese Emperor ‘sent envoys
thither to procure the method of boiling out sugar, and then ordered
the Yang-chou sugar-cane growers to press it out in the same way,
when it appeared that both in colour and taste ours excelled that of

Ts’uän-chou and Chang-chou are at the present day pronounced in
_exactly the same way_—_i.e._, ‘Chiong-chiu,’ and it is by no means
impossible that Marco Polo’s _Tyunju_ is an attempt to reproduce this
sound, especially as, coming to Zaitun _viâ_ Foochow, he would probably
first hear the Foochow pronunciation.” (E. H. PARKER, _Asiatic Quart.

“Hung Ts’a-k’iu, who set out overland _viâ_ Corea and Tsushima in
1281, is much more likely than Fan Wên-hu to be Von-sain-_chin_
(probably a misprint for _chiu_), for the same reason _Vo_-cim stands
for _Yung_-ch’ang, and _sa_ for _sha, ch’a, ts’a_, etc. A-la-han (not
A-ts’ï-han) fell sick at the start, and was replaced by A-ta-hai.
To copy _Abacan_ for _Alahan_ would be a most natural error, and I

Sagatu appointed at the head of the Chinese Army on the 16th July,

Mr. C. O. Blagden has some objection to Sundar Fūlāt being Pulo Condor:
“In connexion with Sundur-Fūlāt, some difficulties seem to arise.
If it represents Pulo Condor, why should navigators on their way to
China call at it _after_ visiting Champa, which lies beyond it? And if
_fūlāt_ represents a Persian plural of the Malay _Pulau_, ‘island,’ why
does it not precede the proper name as generic names do in Malay and in
Indonesian and Southern Indo-Chinese languages generally? Further, if
_ṣundur_ represents a native form _čundur_, whence the hard _c_ (= _k_)
of our modern form of the word? I am not aware that Malay changes _č_
to _k_ in an initial position.” (_J. R. As. Soc._, April, 1914, p. 496.)

According to W. Tomaschek (_Die topographischen Capitel des Indischen
Seespiegels Moḥīṭ_, Vienna, 1897, Map XXIII.) it should be read
_Lōšak_ = The _Lochac_ of the G. T. “It is _Laṅkāçoka_ of the Tanjore
inscription of 1030, the _Ling ya ssī kia_ of the _Chu-fan-chï_ of
Chau Ju-kua, the _Lěṅkasuka_ of the _Nāgarakrětāgama_, the _Lang-šakā_
of Sulayman al Mahri, situated on the eastern side of the Malay
Peninsula.” (G. FERRAND, _Malaka, le Malāyu et Malāyur_, _J. As._,
July–Aug, 1918, p. 91.) On the situation of this place which has been

the aloes-wood called _Lawáki_ in the _Ain-i-Akbari_ written in the
16th century, FERRAND, _Textes_, I., p. 285 n., remarks: “On vient de
voir que Ibn-al-Bayṭār a emprunté ce nom à Avicenne (980–1037) qui
écrivit son _Canon de la Médecine_ dans les premières années du XIᵉ
siècle. _Lawāḳ_ ou Lowāḳ nous est donc attesté sous la forme _Lawāḳi_
ou _Lowāḳī_ dès le Xᵉ siècle, puis qu’il est mentionné, au début du
XIᵉ, par Avicenne qui résidait alors à Djurdjān, sur la Caspienne.”

          OF THE ISLAND CALLED PENTAM, AND THE CITY MALAIUR.

The late Col. G. E. Gerini published in the _J. R. A. S._, July, 1905,
pp. 485–511, a paper on the _Nāgarakretāgama_, a Javanese poem composed
by a native bard named Prapañca, in honour of his sovereign Hayam
Wuruk (1350–1389), the greatest ruler of Mājapāhit. He upsets all the
theories accepted hitherto regarding _Panten_. The southernmost portion
of the Malay Peninsula is known as the _Malaya_ or _Malayu_ country
(Tānah-Malāyu) = Chinese _Ma-li-yü-êrh = Malāyur = Maluir_ of Marco
Polo, witness the river _Malāyu_ (_Sungei Malāyu_) still so called, and
the village _Bentan_, both lying there (ignored by all Col. Gerini’s
predecessors) on the northern shore of the Old Singapore Strait. Col.
Gerini writes (p. 509): “There exists to this day a village _Bentam_
on the mainland side of Singapore Strait, right opposite the mouth of
the Sungei Selitar, on the northern shore of Singapore Island, it is
not likely that both travellers [Polo and Odoric] mistook the coast of
the Malay Peninsula for an island. The island of _Pentam_, _Paten_,
or _Pantem_ must therefore be the _Be-Tūmah_ (Island) of the Arab
Navigators, the _Tamasak_ Island of the Malays; and, in short, the
Singapore Island of our day.” He adds: “The island of _Pentam_ cannot
be either Batang or Bitang, the latter of which is likewise mentioned
by Marco Polo under the same name of _Pentam_, but 60 + 30 = 90 miles
before reaching the former. Batang, girt all round by dangerous
reefs, is inaccessible except to small boats. So is Bintang, with the
exception of its south-western side, where is now Riāu, and where, a
little further towards the north, was the settlement at which the chief
of the island resided in the fourteenth century. There was no reason
for Marco Polo’s junk to take that roundabout way in order to call at
such, doubtlessly insignificant place. And the channel (_i.e._ Rhio
Strait) has far more than four paces’ depth of water, whereas there are
no more than two fathoms at the western entrance to the Old Singapore
Strait.”

Marco Polo says (II., p. 280): “Throughout this distance [from Pentam]
there is but four paces’ depth of water, so that great ships in passing
this channel have to lift their rudders, for they draw nearly as
much water as that.” Gerini remarks that it is unmistakably the _Old
Singapore Strait_, and that there is no channel so shallow throughout
all those parts except among reefs. “The _Old Strait_ or _Selat
Tebrau_, says N. B. Dennys, _Descriptive Dict. of British Malaya_,
separating Singapore from Johore. Before the settlement of the former,
this was the only known route to China; it is generally about a mile
broad, but in some parts little more than three furlongs. Crawford
went through it in a ship of 400 tons, and found the passage tedious
but safe.” Most of Sinologists, Beal, Chavannes, Pelliot, _Bul. Ecole
franç. Ext. Orient_, IV., 1904, pp. 321–2, 323–4, 332–3, 341, 347,
place the Malaiur of Marco Polo at Palembang in Sumatra.

                             TANA-MALAYU.

“On a traduit _Tānah Malāyu_ par ‘Pays des Malais,’ mais cette
traduction n’est pas rigoureusement exacte. Pour prendre une expression
parallèle, _Tānah Djāwa_ signifie ‘Pays de Java,’ mais non ‘Pays des
Javanais.’

“En réalité, _tānah_ ‘terre, sol, pays, contrée’ s’emploie seulement
avec un toponyme qui doit étre rendu par un toponyme équivalent. Le
nom des habitants du pays s’exprime, en malais, en ajoutant _oraṅ_
‘homme, personne, gens, numéral des êtres humains’ au nom du pays:
‘_oraṅ Malāyu_’ Malais, litt. ‘gens de Malāyu’; _oraṅ Djāwa_ Javanais,
litt. ‘gens de Java.’ _Tānah Malāyu_ a donc très nettement le sens
de ‘pays de Malāyu’; cf. l’expression kawi correspondante dans le
_Nāgarakrêtāgama: tanah ri Malayu_ ‘pays de Malāyu’ où chaque mot
français recouvre exactement le substantif, la préposition et le
toponyme de l’expression kawi. Le _taná Malayo_ de Barros s’applique
donc à un pays déterminé du nom de Malāyu qui, d’après l’auteur des
_Décades_, était situé entre Djambi et Palembaṅ. Nous savons, d’autre
part, que le pays en question avait sa capitale dans l’intérieur de
l’île, mais qu’il s’étendait dans l’Est jusqu’à la mer et que la côte
orientale a été désignée par les textes chinois du VIIᵉ siècle sous
le nom de _Mo-lo-yeou, Mo-lo-yu = Malāyu_, c’est-à-dire par le nom de
l’Etat ou royaume dont elle faisait partie.” (G. FERRAND, _J. As._,

See G. FERRAND, _Malaka, le Malayu et Malāyur, J. As._, 1918. Besides
Malayu of Sumatra, there was a city of Malayur which M. Ferrand thinks
is Malacca.

VIII., p. 282 n. “This informs us that Malacca first acknowledged
itself as tributary to the Empire in 1405, the king being
_Sili-ju-eul-sula_ (?).”

In this name _Si-li-ju-eul-su-la_, one must read 八 _pa_, instead of
入, and read _Si-li-pa-eul-su-la_ = Siri Paramisura (Çrī Parameçvara).

                               SUMATRA.

In 1017, an embassy was sent to the Court of China by Haji
Sumutrabhūmi, “the king of the land of Sumutra” (Sumatra). The envoys
had a letter in golden characters and tribute in the shape of pearls,
ivory, Sanscrit, books folded between boards, and slaves; by an
imperial edict they were permitted to see the emperor and to visit some
of the imperial buildings. When they went back an edict was issued
addressed to their king, accompanied by various presents, calculated to
please them. (GROENEVELDT, _Notes on the Malay Archipelago_, p. 65.)
G. Ferrand writes (_J. As._, Mars–Avril, 1917, p. 335) that according
to the texts quoted by him in his article the island of Sumatra was
known to the Chinese under the name _Sumuṭa = Sumutra_, during the
first years of the eleventh century, nearly 300 years before Marco
Polo’s voyage; and under the name of _Šumuṭra_, by the Arab sailors,
previously to the first voyage of the Portuguese in Indonesia.

                                FERLEC.

Prof. Pelliot writes to me that the _Ferlec_ of Marco Polo is to be
found several times in the _Yüan Shi_, year 1282 and following, under
the forms _Fa-li-lang_ (Chap. 12, fol. 4 v.), _Fa-li-la_ (Chap. 13,
fol. 2 v.), _Pie-li-la_ (Chap. 13, fol. 4 v.), _Fa-eul-la_ (Chap. 18,
fol. 8 v.); in the first case, it is quoted near _A-lu_ (_Aru_) and
_Kan-pai_ (Kampei).—Cf. FERRAND, _Textes_, II., p. 670.

                              SAGO TREE.

Sago Palm = _Sagus Rumphianus_ and _S. Lævis_ (DENNYS).—“From Malay
_sāgū_. The farinaceous pith taken out of the stem of several species
of a particular genus of palm, especially _Metroxylon laeve_,
Mart., and _M. Rumphii_, Willd., found in every part of the Indian
Archipelago, including the Philippines, wherever there is proper soil.”

XII., p. 306. “In this island [Necuveran] they have no king nor chief,
but live like beasts. And I tell you they go all naked, both men and
women, and do not use the slightest covering of any kind.”

We have seen (_Marco Polo_, II., p. 308) that Mr. G. Phillips writes
(_J. R. A. S._, July, 1895, p. 529) that the name Tsui-lan given to
the Nicobars by the Chinese is, he has but little doubt, “a corruption
of Nocueran, the name given by Marco Polo to the group. The characters
Tsui-lan are pronounced Ch’ui lan in Amoy, out of which it is easy to
make Cueran. The Chinese omitted the initial syllable and called them
the Cueran Islands, while Marco Polo called them the Nocueran Islands.”
Schlegel, _T’oung Pao_, IX., p. 182–190, thinks that the Andaman
Islands are alone represented by Ts’ui-lan; the Nicobar being the old
country of the Lo-ch’a, and in modern time, _Mao shan_, “Hat Island.”
Pelliot, _Bul. Ecole franç. Ext. Orient_, IV., 1904, pp. 354–5, is
inclined to accept Phillip’s opinion. He says that Mao-shan is one
island, not a group of islands; it is not proved that the country
of the Lo ch’a is the Nicobar Islands; the name of _Lo-hing-man_,
Naked Barbarians, is, contrary to Schlegel’s opinion, given to the
Nicobar as well as to the Andaman people; the name of Andaman appears
in Chinese for the first time during the thirteenth century in Chao
Ju-kwa under the form _Yen-t’o-man_; Chao Ju-kwa specifies that going
from Lambri (_Sumatra_) to Ceylon, it is an unfavourable wind which
makes ships drift towards these islands; on the other hand, texts
show that the Ts’ui-lan islands were on the usual route from Sumatra
to Ceylon.—Gerini, _Researches_, p. 396, considers that _Ts’ui-lan
shan_ is but the phonetic transcript of _Tilan-chong_ Island, the
north-easternmost of the Nicobars.—See Hirth and Rockhill’s _Chau
Ju-kwa_, p. 12n.—Sansk. _nārikera_, “cocoanuts,” is found in Necuveram.

                              ANGAMANAIN.

“When sailing from Lan-wu-li to Si-lan, if the wind is not fair, ships
may be driven to a place called Yen-t’o-man [in Cantonese, An-t’o-man].
This is a group of two islands in the middle of the sea, one of them
being large, the other small; the latter is quite uninhabited. The
large one measures seventy _li_ in circuit. The natives on it are of a
colour resembling black lacquer; they eat men alive, so that sailors
dare not anchor on this coast.

“This island does not contain so much as an inch of iron, for which
reason the natives use (bits of) conch-shell (ch’ö-k’ü) with ground
edges instead of knives. On this island is a sacred relic, (the
so-called) ‘Corpse on a bed of rolling gold....’” (CHAU JU-KWA, p. 147.)

XIII., p. 311.

                        DOG-HEADED BARBARIANS.

Rockhill in a note to Carpini (_Rubruck_, p. 36) mentions “the Chinese
annals of the sixth century (_Liang Shu_, bk. 54; _Nan shih_, bk. 79)
which tell of a kingdom of dogs (_Kou kuo_) in some remote corner of
north-eastern Asia. The men had human bodies but dogs’ heads, and their
speech sounded like barking. The women were like the rest of their sex
in other parts of the world.”

Dr. Laufer writes to me: “A clear distinction must be made between
dog-headed people and the motive of descent from a dog-ancestor,—two
entirely different conceptions. The best exposition of the subject
of the cynocephali according to the traditions of the Ancients is
now presented by J. MARQUART (_Benin-Sammlung des Reichsmuseums in
Leiden_, pp. cc–ccxix). It is essential to recognize that the mediæval
European, Arabic, and Chinese fables about the country of the dog-heads
are all derived from one common source, which is traceable to the
Greek Romance of Alexander; that is an Oriental-Hellenistic cycle. In
a wider sense, the dog-heads belong to the cycle of wondrous peoples,
which assumed shape among the Greek mariners under the influence of
Indian and West-Asiatic ideas. The tradition of the _Nan shi_ (Ch.
79, p. 4), in which the motive of the dog-heads, the women, however,
being of human shape, meets its striking parallel in Adam of Bremen
(_Gesta hamburg. ecclesiæ pontificum_, 4, 19), who thus reports on the
_Terra Feminarum_ beyond the Baltic Sea: ‘Cumque pervenerint ad partum,
si quid masculini generis est, fiunt cynocephali, si quid femini,
speciosissimæ mulieres.’ See further KLAPROTH, _J. As._, XII., 1833,
p. 287; DULAURIER, _J. As._, 1858, p. 472; ROCKHILL, _Rubruck_, p. 36.”

In an interesting paper on Walrus and Narwhal Ivory, Dr. Laufer
(_T’oung Pao_, July, 1916, p. 357) refers to dog-headed men with women
of human shape, from a report from the Mongols received by King Hethum
of Armenia.

  XIV., p. 313. “The people [of Ceylon] are Idolaters, and go quite
  naked except that they cover the middle.... The King of this Island
  possesses a ruby which is the finest and biggest in the world; I
  will tell you what it is like. It is about a palm in length, and
  as thick as a man’s arm; to look at, it is the most resplendent
  object upon earth; it is quite free from flaw and as red as fire.
  Its value is so great that a price for it in money could hardly be
  named at all.”

Chau Ju-kwa, p. 73, has: “The King holds in his hand a jewel five
inches in diameter, which cannot be burnt by fire, and which shines in
(the darkness of) night like a torch. The King rubs his face with it
daily, and though he were passed ninety he would retain his youthful
looks.

“The people of the country are very dark-skinned, they wrap a sarong
round their bodies, go bare-headed and bare-footed.”

In a paper on _Burkhan_ printed in the _Journal of the American
Oriental Society_, XXXVI., 1917, pp. 390–395, Dr. Berthold Laufer
has come to the following conclusion: “Burkhan in Mongol by no means
conveys exclusively the limited notion of Buddha, but, first of all,
signifies ‘deity, god, gods,’ and secondly ‘representation or image of
a god.’ This general significance neither inheres in the term Buddha
nor in Chinese Fo; neither do the latter signify ‘image of Buddha’;
only Mongol _burkhan_ has this force, because originally it conveyed
the meaning of a shamanistic image. From what has been observed on
the use of the word _burkhan_ in the shamanistic or pre-Buddhistic
religions of the Tungusians, Mongols and Turks, it is manifest that the
word well existed there before the arrival of Buddhism, fixed in its
form and meaning, and was but subsequently transferred to the name of
Buddha.”

The German traveller von Le Coq has found at Turfan fragments of
this legend in Turki which he published in 1912 in his _Türkische
Manichaica_, which agree with the legend given by the Persian Ibn
Bâbawaih of Qum, who died in 991. (S. d’OLDENBOURG, _Bul. Ac. I. des
Sc._, Pet., 1912, pp. 779–781; W. RADLOFF, _Alttürk. Stud._, VI., zu

J. Asiatique_, Sept.–Oct., 1917, pp. 269 _seq._; _Rev. de l’Hist. des

Speaking of Chu-lién (Chola Dominion, Coromandel Coast), Chau Ju-kwa,
pp. 93–4, says:—

“The kingdom of Chu-lién is the Southern Yin-tu of the west. To the
east (its capital) is five _li_ distant from the sea; to the west one
comes to Western India (after) 1500 _li_; to the south one comes to
Lo-lan (after) 2500 _li_; to the north one comes to Tun-t’ien (after)
3000 _li_.”

Hirth and Rockhill remark, p. 98: “Ma Tuan-lin and the _Sung-shï_
reproduce textually this paragraph (the former writer giving
erroneously the distance between the capital and the sea as 5000 _li_).
Yule, _Marco Polo_, II, p. 335, places the principal port of the
Chola kingdom at Kaveripattanam, the ‘Paṭṭaṇam’ par excellence of the
Coromandel Coast, and at one of the mouths of the Kaveri. He says that
there seems to be some evidence that the Tanjore ports were, before
1300, visited by Chinese trade. The only Lo-lan known to mediæval
Chinese is mentioned in the _T’ang-shu_, 221⁸, and is identified with
the capital of Bamian, in Afghanistan. I think our text is corrupt
here and that the character _lo_ should be changed to _si_, and that
we should read Si-lan, our Ceylon. Both Ma and the _Sung-shï_ say that
2500 _li_ south-east of Chu-lién was ‘Si-lan-ch’ï-kuo’ with which
it was at war. Of course the distance mentioned is absurd, but all
figures connected with Chu-lién in Chinese accounts are inexplicably

                     CHINESE PAGODA AT NEGAPATAM.

Sir Walter ELLIOT, K.C.S.I., to whom Yule refers for the information
given about this pagoda, has since published in the _Indian Antiquary_,
VII., 1878, pp. 224–227, an interesting article with the title: _The
Edifice formerly known as the Chinese or Jaina Pagoda at Negapatam_,
from which we gather the following particulars regarding its
destruction:—

“It went by various names, as the _Puduveli-gôpuram_, the old pagoda,
Chinese pagoda, black pagoda, and in the map of the Trigonometrical
Survey (Sheet 79) it stands as the Jeyna (Jaina) pagoda. But save in
name it has nothing in common with Hindu or Muhammadan architecture,
either in form or ornament.”

“In 1859, the Jesuit Fathers presented a petition to the Madras
Government representing the tower to be in a dangerous condition, and
requesting permission to pull it down and appropriate the materials
to their own use....” In 1867 “the Fathers renewed their application
for leave to remove it, on the following grounds: ‘1st, because they
considered it to be unsafe in its present condition; 2nd, because it
obstructed light and sea-breeze from a chapel which they had built
behind it; 3rd, because they would very much like to get the land on
which it stood; and 4th, because the bricks of which it was built would
be very useful to them for building purposes.’

“The Chief Engineer, who meanwhile had himself examined the edifice,
and had directed the District Engineer to prepare a small estimate
for its repair, reported that the first only of the above reasons had
any weight, and that it would be met if Colonel O’Connell’s estimate,
prepared under his own orders, received the sanction of Government. He
therefore recommended that this should be given, and the tower allowed
to stand....

“The Chief Engineer’s proposal did not meet with approval, and on
the 28th August 1867, the following order was made on the Jesuits’
petition: ‘The Governor in Council is pleased to sanction the removal
of the old tower at Negapatam by the officers of St. Joseph’s
College, at their own expense, and the appropriation of the available
material to such school-building purposes as they appear to have in
contemplation.

“The Fathers were not slow in availing themselves of this permission.
The venerable building was speedily levelled, and the site cleared.”

In making excavations connected with the college a bronze image
representing a Buddhist or Jaina priest in the costume and attitude
of the figures in wood and metal brought from Burma was found; it was
presented to Lord Napier, in 1868; a reproduction of it is given in Sir
Walter Elliot’s paper.

In a note added by Dr. Burnell to this paper, we read: “As I several
times in 1866 visited the ruin referred to, I may be permitted to say
that it had become merely a shapeless mass of bricks. I have no doubt
that it was originally a _vimâna_ or shrine of some temple; there are
some of precisely the same construction in parts of the Chingleput
district.”

XVI., p. 336 n.

                              NEGAPATAM.

We read in the _Tao yi chi lio_ (1349) that “T’u t’a (the eastern
stupa) is to be found in the flat land of Pa-tan (Fattan, Negapatam?)
and that it is surrounded with stones. There is a stupa of earth and
brick many feet high; it bears the following Chinese inscription: ‘The
work was finished in the eighth moon of the third year _hien chw’en_
(1267).’ It is related that these characters have been engraved by
some Chinese in imitation of inscriptions on stone of those countries;
up to the present time, they have not been destroyed.” Hien chw’en is
the _nien hao_ of Tu Tsung, one of the last emperors of the Southern
Sung Dynasty, not of a Mongol Sovereign. I owe this information to
Prof. Pelliot, who adds that the comparison between the Chinese Pagoda
of Negapatam and the text of the _Tao yi chi lio_ has been made
independent of him by Mr. Fujita in the _Tōkyō-gakuhō_, November, 1913,
pp. 445–46. (_Cathay_, I., p. 81 n.)

XVII., p. 340. “Here [Maabar] are no horses bred; and thus a great part
of the wealth of the country is wasted in purchasing horses; I will
tell you how. You must know that the merchants of Kis and Hormes, Dofar
and Soer and Aden collect great numbers of destriers and other horses,
and these they bring to the territories of this King and of his four
brothers, who are kings likewise as I told you....”

Speaking of Yung (or Wöng) man, Chau Ju-kwa tells us (p. 133): “In
the mountains horse-raising is carried on a large scale. The other
countries which trade here purchase horses, pearls and dates which they
get in exchange for cloves, cardamom seeds and camphor.”

XVII., p. 341.

                           SUTTEES IN INDIA.

“Suttee is a Brahmanical rite, and there is a Sanskrit ritual in
existence (see _Classified Index to the Tanjore MSS._, p. 135_a._). It
was introduced into Southern India with the Brahman civilization, and
was prevalent there chiefly in the Brahmanical Kingdom of Vijayanagar,
and among the Mahrattas. In Malabar, the most primitive part of S.
India, the rite is forbidden (Anāchāranirṇaya, v. 26). The cases
mentioned by Teixeira, and in the _Lettres édifiantes_, occurred at
Tanjore and Madura. A (Mahratta) Brahman at Tanjore told one of the
present writers that he had to perform commemorative funeral rites for
his grandfather and grandmother on the same day, and this indicated
that his grandmother had been a _satī_.” YULE, _Hobson-Jobson_. Cf.
_Cathay_, II., pp. 139–140.

                                MAABAR.

XVII., p. 345. Speaking of this province, Marco Polo says: “They have
certain abbeys in which are gods and goddesses to whom many young girls
are consecrated; their fathers and mothers presenting them to that idol
for which they entertain the greatest devotion. And when the [monks] of
a convent desire to make a feast to their god, they send for all those
consecrated damsels and make them sing and dance before the idol with
great festivity. They also bring meats to feed their idol withal; that
is to say, the damsels prepare dishes of meat and other good things
and put the food before the idol, and leave it there a good while, and
then the damsels all go to their dancing and singing and festivity for
about as long as a great Baron might require to eat his dinner. By that
time they say the spirit of the idols has consumed the substance of the
food, so they remove the viands to be eaten by themselves with great
jollity. This is performed by these damsels several times every year
until they are married.”

Chau Ju-kwa has the following passage in Cambodia (p. 53): “(The
people) are devout Buddhists. There are serving (in the temples) some
three hundred foreign women; they dance and offer food to the Buddha.
They are called _a-nan_ or slave dancing-girls.”

Hirth and Rockhill, who quote Marco Polo’s passage, remark, p. 55 n.:
“_A-nan_, as here written, is the usual transcription of the Sanskrit
word _ānanda_, ‘joy, happiness.’ The almeh or dancing-girls are usually
called in India _deva-dāsī_ (‘slave of a god’) or _rāmjani_.”

In Guzerat, Chau Ju-kwa, p. 92, mentions: “Four thousand Buddhist
temple buildings, in which live over twenty thousand dancing-girls who
sing twice daily while offering food to the Buddha (_i.e._, the idols)
and while offering flowers.”

                       TRADITIONS OF ST. THOMAS.

“The traditional site of the Apostle’s Tomb, now adjacent to the
sea-shore, has recently come to be enclosed in the crypt of the new
Cathedral of San Thomé.” (A. E. MEDLYCOTT, _India and the Apostle
Thomas. An inquiry. With a critical analysis of the Acta Thomæ_.
London, David Nutt, 1905, 8vo.)

In the beginning of the sixteenth century Barbosa found the church of
St. Thomas half in ruins and grown round with jungle. A Mahomedan fakir
kept it and maintained a lamp. Yet in 1504, which is several years
earlier than Barbosa’s voyage, the Syrian Bishop Jaballaha, who had
been sent by the Patriarch to take charge of the Indian Christians,
reported that the House of St. Thomas had begun to be inhabited by some
Christians, who were engaged in restoring it.

Mr. W. R. Philipps has a valuable paper on _The Connection of St.
Thomas the Apostle with India_ in the _Indian Antiquary_, XXXII., 1903,
pp. 1–15, 145–160; he has come to the following conclusions: “(1)
There is good early evidence that St. Thomas was the apostle of the
Parthian empire; and also evidence that he was the apostle of ‘India’
in some limited sense,—probably of an ‘India’ which included the Indus
Valley, but nothing to the east or south of it. (2) According to the
Acts, the scene of the martyrdom of St. Thomas was in the territory of
a king named, according to the Syriac version, Mazdai, to which he had
proceeded after a visit to the city of a king named, according to the
same version, Gūdnaphar or Gūndaphar. (3) There is no evidence at all
that the place where St. Thomas was martyred was in Southern India;
and all the indications point to another direction. (4) We have no
indication whatever, earlier than that given by Marco Polo, who died
1324, that there ever was even a tradition that St. Thomas was buried
in Southern India.”

In a recent and learned work (_Die Thomas Legende_, 1912, 8vo.) Father
J. Dahlmann has tried to prove that the story of the travels of St.
Thomas in India has an historical basis. If there is some possibility
of admitting a voyage of the Apostle to N.W. India (and the flourishing
state of Buddhism in this part of India is not in favour of Christian
Evangelization), it is impossible to accept the theory of the martyrdom
of St. Thomas in Southern India.

The late Mr. J. F. FLEET, in his paper on St. Thomas and Gondophernes
(_Journ. Roy. As. Soc._, April, 1905, pp. 223–236), remarks that
“Mr. Philipps has given us an exposition of the western traditional
statements up to the sixth century.” He gives some of the most ancient
statements; one in its earliest traceable form runs thus: “According
to the Syriac work entitled The Doctrine of the Apostles, which was
written in perhaps the second century A.D., St. Thomas evangelized
‘India.’ St. Ephraem the Syrian (born about A.D. 300, died about 378),
who spent most of his life at Edessa, in Mesopotamia, states that the
Apostle was martyred in ‘India’ and that his relics were taken thence
to Edessa. That St. Thomas evangelized the Parthians, is stated by
Origen (born A.D. 185 or 186, died about 251–254). Eusebius (bishop of
Cæsarea Palæstinæ from A.D. 315 to about 340) says the same. And the
same statement is made by the Clementine Recognitions, the original
of which may have been written about A.D. 210. A fuller tradition is
found in the Acts of St. Thomas, which exist in Syriac, Greek, Latin,
Armenian, Ethiopic, and Arabic, and in a fragmentary form in Coptic.
And this work connects with St. Thomas two eastern kings, whose names
appear in the Syriac version as Gūdnaphar, Gundaphar, and Mazdai; and
in the Greek version as Goundaphoros, Goundiaphoros, Gountaphoros, and
Misdaios, Misdeos; in the Latin version as Gundaforus, Gundoforus, and
Misdeus, Mesdeus, Migdeus; and in the remaining versions in various
forms, of the same kind, which need not be particularized here.” Mr.
Fleet refers to several papers, and among them to one by Prof. Sylvain
Lévi, _Saint Thomas, Gondopharès et Mazdeo (Journ. As.,_ Janv.–Fév.,
1897, pp. 27–42), who takes the name Mazdai as a transformation of a
Hindū name, made on Iranian soil and under Mazdean influences, and
arrived at through the forms Bazodēo, Bazdēo, or Bāzodēo, Bāzdēo, which
occur in Greek legends on coins, and to identify the person with the
king Vāsudēva of Mathurā, a successor of Kanishka. Mr. Fleet comes to
the conclusion that: “No name, save that of Guduphara—Gondophernès, in
any way resembling it, is met with in any period of Indian history,
save in that of the Takht-i-Bahi inscription of A.D. 46; nor, it may
be added, any royal name, save that of Vāsudēva of Mathurā, in any
way resembling that of Mazdai. So also, as far as we know or have any
reason to suppose, no name like that of Guduphara—Gondophernēs is
to be found anywhere outside India, save in the tradition about St.
Thomas.”

On this city of the martyrdom of St. Thomas, see _Indian Antiquary_,

pp. 31–2, a note signed W. R. P.

XIX., p. 361. “In this kingdom [Mutfili] also are made the best and
most delicate buckrams, and those of highest price; in sooth they look
like tissue of spider’s web!”

In Nan p’i (in Malabar) Chau Ju-kwa has (p. 88): “The native products
include pearls, foreign cotton-stuff of all colours (_i.e._ coloured
chintzes) and _tou-lo mién_ (cotton-cloth).” Hirth and Rockhill remark
that this cotton-cloth is probably “the buckram which looks like tissue
of spider’s web” of which Polo speaks, and which Yule says was the
famous muslin of Masulipatam. Speaking of Cotton, Chau Ju-kwa (pp.
217–8) writes: “The _ki pe_ tree resembles a small mulberry-tree,
with a hibiscus-like flower furnishing a floss half an inch and more
in length, very much like goose-down, and containing some dozens of
seeds. In the south the people remove the seed from the floss by means
of iron chopsticks, upon which the floss is taken in the hand and spun
without troubling about twisting together the thread. Of the cloth
woven therefrom there are several qualities; the most durable and
the strongest is called _t’ou-lo-mién_; the second quality is called
_fan-pu_ or ‘foreign cloth’; the third ‘tree cotton’ or _mu-mién_; the
fourth _ki-pu_. These textures are sometimes dyed in various colours
and brightened with strange patterns. The pieces measure up to five or
six feet in breadth.”

XXI., p. 373.

                           THE CITY OF CAIL.

Prof. E. H. PARKER writes in the _Journal of the North-China Branch of
the Royal Asiatic Soc._, XXXVII., 1906, p. 196: “Yule’s identification
of Kayal with the Kolkhoi of Ptolemy is supported by the Sung History,
which calls it both Ko-ku-lo and Ku-lo; it was known at the beginning
of the tenth century and was visited by several Chinese priests. In
1411 the Ming Dynasty actually called it Ka-i-lêh and mention a chief
or king there named Ko-pu-che-ma.”

XXII., p. 376. “OF THE KINGDOM OF COILUM.—So also their wine they make
from [palm-] sugar; capital drink it is, and very speedily it makes a
man drunk.”

Chau Ju-kwa in Nan p’i (Malabar) mentions the wine (p. 89): “For wine
they use a mixture of honey with cocoanuts and the juice of a flower,
which they let ferment.” Hirth and Rockhill remark, p. 91, that the
Kambojians had a drink which the Chinese called _mi-t’ang tsiu_, to
prepare which they used half honey and half water, adding a ferment.

XXII., p. 380 n. “This word [_Sappan_] properly means _Japan_, and
seems to have been given to the wood as a supposed product of that
region.”

“The word _sappan_ is not connected with Japan. The earliest records
of this word are found in Chinese sources. _Su-fang su-pwaṅ_, to be
restored to _’supang_ or _’spang_, _’sbang_; _Caesalpinia sappan_,
furnishing the sappan wood, is first described as a product of Kiu-chen
(Tong King) in the _Nan fang ts’ao mi chuang_, written by Ki Han
at the end of the third or beginning of the fourth century. J. de
Loureiro (_Flora cochinchinensis_, p. 321) observes in regard to this
tree, ‘Habitat in altis montibus Cochinchinæ: indeque a mercatoribus
sinensibus abunde exportatur.’ The tree accordingly is indigenous
to Indo-China, where the Chinese first made its acquaintance. The
Chinese transcription is surely based on a native term then current
in Indo-China, and agrees very well with Khmer _sbaṅ_ (or _sbang_):
see AYMONIER et CABATON, _Dict. čam-français_, 510, who give further
Čam _hapaṅ_, Batak _sopȧn_, Makassar _sappaṅ_, and Malay _sepaṅ_. The
word belongs to those which the Mon-Khmer and Malayan languages have
anciently in common.” (Note of Dr. B. LAUFER.)

                              FANDARAINA.

Prof. E. H. PARKER writes in the _Journal of the North-China Branch
of the Royal Asiatic Soc._, XXXVII., 1906, p. 196: “Regarding the
Fandaráina country of the Arabs mentioned by Yule in the Notes to
pages 386, 391, and 440 of Vol. II., it may be interesting to cite the
following important extract from Chapter 94, page 29, of the _Yuän
Shï_:—‘In 1295 sea-traders were forbidden to take fine values to trade
with the three foreign states of Ma-pa-r, Pei nan, and Fan-ta-la-i-na,
but 2,500,000 nominal taels in paper money were set apart for the
purpose.’”

XXV., p. 391.

In the _Yuen Shi_, ch. 94, fol. 11 rᵒ, the “three barbarian kingdoms
of _Ma-pa-eul_ (Ma’abar), _Pei-nan_ (corr. _Kiu-nam, Coilam_) and
_Fan-ta-la-yi-na_” are mentioned. No doubt the last kingdom refers to
the _Fandaraina_ of Ibn Batuta, and Prof. Pelliot, who gives me this
information, believes it is also, in the middle of the fourteenth
century, _Pan-ta-li_ of the _Tao yi chi lio_.

                               GOZURAT.

XXV., p. 393. “In this province of Gozurat there grows much pepper,
and ginger, and indigo. They have also a great deal of cotton. Their
cotton trees are of very great size, growing full six paces high, and
attaining to an age of 20 years.”

Chau Ju-kwa has, p. 92: “The native products comprise great quantities
of indigo, red kino, myrobolans and foreign cotton stuffs of every
colour. Every year these goods are transported to the Ta shï countries
for sale.”

XXXI., p. 404.

                  TWO ISLANDS CALLED MALE AND FEMALE.

Speaking of the fabulous countries of women, Chau Ju-kwa, p. 151,
writes: “The women of this country [to the south-east (beyond Sha-hua
kung?) Malaysia] conceive by exposing themselves naked to the full
force of the south wind, and so give birth to female children.”

“In the Western Sea there is also a country of women where only three
females go to every five males; the country is governed by a queen,
and all the civil offices are in the hands of women, whereas the men
perform military duties. Noble women have several males to wait upon
them; but the men may not have female attendants. When a woman gives
birth to a child, the latter takes its name from the mother. The
climate is usually cold. The chase with bow and arrows is their chief
occupation. They carry on barter with Ta-t’sin and T’ien-chu, in which
they make several hundred per cent. profit.”

Cf. F. Hirth, _China and the Roman Orient_, pp. 200–202.

XXXII., pp. 406–7. Speaking of Scotra, Marco (II., p. 406) says: “The
ambergris comes from the stomach of the whale, and as it is a great
object of trade, the people contrive to take the whales with barbed
iron darts, which, once they are fixed in the body, cannot come out
again. A long cord is attached to this end, to that a small buoy which
floats on the surface, so that when the whale dies they know where to
find it. They then draw the body ashore and extract the ambergris from
the stomach and the oil from the head.”

Chau Ju-kwa, at Chung-li (Somali Coast), has (p. 131): “Every year
there are driven on the coast a great many dead fish measuring two
hundred feet in length and twenty feet through the body. The people do
not eat the flesh of these fish, but they cut out their brains, marrow,
and eyes, from which they get oil, often as much as three hundred odd
_töng_ (from a single fish). They mix this oil with lime to caulk their
boats, and use it also in lamps. The poor people use the ribs of these
fish to make rafters, the backbones for door leaves, and they cut off
vertebræ to make mortars with.”

                                SCOTRA.

XXXII., p. 407. “And you must know that in this island there are the
best enchanters in the world. It is true that their Archbishop forbids
the practice to the best of his ability; but ’tis all to no purpose,
for they insist that their forefathers followed it, and so must they
also. I will give you a sample of their enchantments. Thus, if a ship
be sailing past with a fair wind and a strong, they will raise a
contrary wind and compel her to turn back. In fact they make the wind
blow as they list, and produce great tempests and disasters; and other
such sorceries they perform, which it will be better to say nothing
about in our Book.”

Speaking of Chung-li (Somali Coast), Chau Ju-kwa writes, p. 130: “There
are many sorcerers among them who are able to change themselves into
birds, beasts, or aquatic animals, and by these means keep the ignorant
people in a state of terror. If some of them in trading with some
foreign ship have a quarrel, the sorcerers pronounce a charm over the
ship, so that it can neither go forward nor backward, and they only
release the ship when it has settled the dispute. The government has
formally forbidden this practice.”

Hirth and Rockhill add, p. 132: “Friar Joanno dos Santos (A.D. 1597)
says: ‘In the Ile of Zanzibar dwelt one Chande, a great sorcerer,
which caused his Pangayo, which the Factor had taken against his will,
to stand still as it were in defiance of the Winde, till the Factor had
satisfied him, and then to fly forth the River after her fellowes at
his words. He made that a Portugall which had angered him, could never
open his mouth to speake, but a Cocke crowed in his belly, till he had
reconciled himselfe: with other like sorceries.’” See PURCHAS, _His
Pilgrimes_, IX., 254.

of the witchcraft of the natives of Socotra. Theo. BENT, _Southern

XXXIII., p. 412. Speaking of the bird Ruc at Madeigascar, Marco Polo
says: “It is so strong that it will seize an elephant in its talons
and carry him high into the air, and drop him so that he is smashed to
pieces; having so killed him the bird gryphon swoops down on him and
eats him at leisure.”

Chau Ju-kwa writing of K’un lun ts’öng’ ki, on the coast of Africa,
writes, p. 149: “This country is in the sea to the south-west. It is
adjacent to a large island. There are usually (there, _i.e._, on the
great island) great _p’öng_ birds which so mask the sun in their flight
that the shade on the sundial is shifted. If the great _p’öng_ finds a
wild camel it swallows it, and if one should chance to find a _p’öng’s_
feather, he can make a water-butt of it, after cutting off the hollow
quill.”

                               THE RUKH.

The Chinese traveller Chau Ju-kwa in his work _Chu-fan-chï_ on the
Chinese and Arab trade in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
speaking of the country of Pi p’a lo (Berbera), says: “The country
brings forth also the (so-called) ‘camel crane’, which measures from
the ground to its crown from six to seven feet. It has wings and can
fly, but not to any great height.” The translators and commentators
Hirth and Rockhill have (p. 129) the following notes: “Quotation
from _Ling-wai-tai-ta_, 3, 6ᵃ. The ostrich was first made known to
the Chinese in the beginning of the second century of our era, when
some were brought to the court of China from Parthia. The Chinese
then called them _An-si-tsio_ ‘Parthian bird.’ See _Hou Han Shu_, 88,
and Hirth, _China and Roman Orient_, 39. In the _Weï shu_, 102, 12^b,
no name is given them, they are simply ‘big birds which resemble a
camel, which feed on herbs and flesh and are able to eat fire.’ In the
_T’ang shu_, 221, 7ᵃ, it is said that this bird is commonly called
‘camel-bird.’ It is seven feet high, black of colour, its feet like
those of the camel, it can travel three hundred _li_ a day, and is able
to eat iron. The ostrich is called by the Persians _ushturmurgh_ and by
the Arabs _ṭeir al-djamal_, both meaning ‘camel birds.’”

Dr. Bretschneider in his Notes on _Chinese Mediæval Travellers to the
West_ (1875), p. 87, n. 132, has a long note with a figure from the
_Pen ts’ao kang mu_ on the “camel-bird” (p. 88).

Speaking of Pi p’a lo (Berbera Coast) Chau Ju-kwa (p. 128) says: “There
is also (in this country) a wild animal called _tsu-la;_ it resembles a
camel in shape, an ox in size, and is of a yellow colour. Its fore legs
are five feet long, its hind legs only three feet. Its head is high up
and turned upwards. Its skin is an inch thick.” Giraffe is the iranised
form of the arabic _zurāfa_. Mention is made of giraffes by Chinese
authors at Aden and Mekka. Cf. FERRAND, _J. Asiatique_, July–August,

We read in the _Tao i chi lio_: “This country [Ts’eng yao lo] is to the
south-west of the Ta Shih (Arabs). There are no trees on the coast;
most of the land is saline. The arable ground is poor, so there is but
little grain of any kind, and they mostly raise yams to take its place.

“If any ship going there to trade carries rice as cargo, it makes very
large profits.

“The climate is irregular. In their usages they have the rectitude of
olden times.

“Men and women twist up their hair; they wear a short seamless shirt.
The occupation of the people is netting birds and beasts for food.

“They boil sea-water to make salt and ferment the juice of the
sugar-cane to make spirits. They have a ruler.

“The native products comprise red sandal-wood, dark red sugar-cane,
elephants’ tusks, ambergris, native gold, _ya tsui tan-fan_, lit.,
‘duck-bill sulphate of copper.’

“The goods used in trading are ivory boxes, trade silver, coloured
satins, and the like.” (ROCKHILL, _T’oung Pao_, XVI., 1915, pp. 622–3.)
Cf. CHAU JU-KWA, p. 126.

XXXIV., p. 423. “There is a great deal of trade, and many merchants and
vessels go thither. But the staple trade of the Island is elephants’
teeth, which are very abundant; and they have also much ambergris, as
whales are plentiful.”

Chau Ju-kwa has, p. 126: “The products of the country [Ts’öng-pa]
consist of elephants’ tusks, native gold, ambergris and yellow
sandal-wood.”

In the _Ying yai shêng lan_ we read that “the kingdom (of A-tan) is
on the sea-coast. It is rich and prosperous, the people follow the
doctrine of the Moslims and their speech is Arabic. Their tempers are
overbearing and violent. They have seven to eight thousand well-trained
soldiers, horse and foot, whom the neighbouring countries fear.” (W.
W. ROCKHILL, _T’oung Pao_, XVI., 1915, p. 607.) There is a description
of the giraffe under the name of _K’i lin_; it “has forelegs over nine
feet long, its hind ones are about six feet. Beside its ears grow
fleshy horns. It has a cow’s tail and a deer’s body. It eats millet,
beans, and flour cakes” (p. 609). In the _Si Yang Chao kung tien lu_
(1520 A.D.), we have a similar description: “Its front legs are nine
feet long, its hind legs six feet. Its hoofs have three clefts, it has
a flat mouth. Two short fleshy horns rise from the back of the top
of its head. It has a cow’s tail and a deer’s body. This animal is
called _K’i lin_; it eats grain of any kind.” (_Ibid._) Cf. FERRAND,

At the time of Chau Ju-kwa, Aden was perhaps the most important port of
Arabia for the African and Arabian trade with India and the countries
beyond. It seems highly probable that the Ma-li-pa of the Chinese
must be understood as including Aden, of which they make no mention
whatsoever, but which was one of “the great commercial centres of the
Arabs.” HIRTH and ROCKHILL, p. 25 n.

Shehr, a port on the Hadhramaut coast, is mentioned by Chau Ju-kwa under

We read in the _Ying yai shêng lan:_ “This country [Tsu fa erh] is
between the sea and the mountains. To the east and south is nothing but
the sea. To the north and west are ranges of mountains. One reaches it
from the kingdom of Ku-li (Calicut) journeying north-westward for ten
days and nights. It has no walled towns or villages. The people all
follow the religion of the Moslims. Their physical appearance is good,
their culture is great, the language sincere.

“The native products are frankincense, which is the sap of a tree.
There is also dragon’s blood, aloes, myrrh, _an-hsi-hsiang_ (benzoin),
liquid storax, _muh-pieh-tzŭ (Momordica cochinchinensis)_, and the
like, all of which they exchange for Chinese hempen cloth, silks, and
china-ware.” (ROCKHILL, _T’oung Pao_, XVI., 1915, pp. 611–612.)

The _Sing ch’a shêng lan_ mentions: “The products are the _tsu-la-fa_
(giraffe), gold coins, leopards, ostriches, frankincense, ambergris.”
(_Ibid._, p. 614.)

Dufar is mentioned by Chau Ju-kwa under the name of Nu-fa among the
dependencies of the country of the _Ta-shï_ (Arabs). (HIRTH and

XXXVIII., pp. 445–449.

                             FRANKINCENSE.

Chau Ju-kwa (HIRTH and ROCKHILL, pp. 195–196) tells us: “_Ju hiang_
(‘milk incense’), or _hün-lu-hiang_, comes from the three Ta-shï
countries of Ma-lo-pa, Shï-ho, and Nu-fa, from the depths of the
remotest mountain valleys. The tree which yields this drug may, on the
whole, be compared to the _sung_ (pine). Its trunk is notched with a
hatchet, upon which the resin flows out, and when hardened, turns into
incense, which is gathered and made into lumps. It is transported on
elephants to the Ta-shï (on the coast); the Ta-shï load it upon their
ships for barter against other goods in San-fo-ts’i: and it is for this
reason that the incense is commonly collected at San-fo-ts’i [the three
ports of the Hadhramaut coast].

“When the foreign merchants come to that place to trade, the Customs
authorities, according to the relative strength of its fragrance,
distinguish thirteen classes of incense. Of these, the very best is
called _kién-hiang_, or ‘picked incense’: it is round and of the size of
the end of a finger; it is commonly called _ti-ju_ or ‘dripping milk.’
The second quality is called _p’ing ju_, or ‘potted milk,’ and its
colour is inferior to that of the ‘picked incense.’ The next quality is
called _p’ing hiang_, or ‘potted incense,’ so called, they say, owing
to its being prized so much at the time of gathering, that it is placed
in pots (_p’ing_). In this _p’ing hiang_ (variety of frankincense)
there are three grades, superior, medium and inferior. The next quality
is called _tai-hiang_, or ‘bag incense’; thus called, they say, because
at the time of gathering, it is merely put into bags; it is also
divided into three qualities, like the _p’ing hiang_.

“The next kind is the _ju-t’a_; it consists of incense mixed with
gravel.

“The next kind is the _heï-t’a_, because its colour is black. The next
kind is the _shui-shï-heï-t’a_, because it consists of incense which
has been ‘water damaged,’ the aroma turned, and the colour spoiled while
on board ship.

“Mixed incense of various qualities and consisting of broken pieces is
called _chö-siau_ (‘cut-up’); when passed through a sieve and made into
dust, it is called _ch’an-mo_ (‘powder’). The above are the various
varieties of frankincense.”

                                RUSSIA.

“It seems that Russia [Chinese _A-lo-sz’_ = Mongol _Oros_; the modern
Chinese name for Russia is _Wo-lo-sz’_] was unknown to the nations of
Eastern Asia before the Mongol period. In the Mongol and Chinese annals
the Russians are first mentioned after Subutai’s invasion of Southern
Russia in 1223. The _Yüan chao pi shi_ terms Russia or the Russians
_Orus_, as they are called even now by the Mongols. The Chinese of
the Mongol period write _A-lo-sz’_, sometimes also _Wa-lo-sz’_ or
_U-lu-sz’_. All these names evidently render the Mongol appellation
_Orus_.

“In the _Yüan shï_ Russia is frequently mentioned.... I may notice
here some other instances where the Russians are spoken of in the
_Yüan-shï_. We read in the annals, _s.a._ 1253, that the Emperor Meng
k’o (Mangu) ordered Bi-dje Bie-rh-k’o to be sent to Wu-lo-sz’ in order
to take a census of the people.

“It is an interesting fact recorded in the _Yüan shï_ that there was in
the first half of the fourteenth century a settlement of Russians near
Peking. In the annals, chap. XXXIV., _s.a._ 1330, it is stated that the
Emperor Wen Tsung (Tob Timur, 1329–32, the great grandson of Kubilai),
formed a regiment composed of _U-lo-sz’_ or Russians. This regiment
being commanded by a _wan hu_ (commander of ten thousand of the third
degree), received the name ‘The Ever-faithful Russian Life-guard.’ It
was placed under the direct control of the council of war. Farther on
in the same chapter it is stated that 140 _king_ of land, north of
_Ta tu_ (Peking) was bought from the peasants and allotted to these
Russians, to establish a camp and to form a military colony. We read
again in the same chapter that they were furnished with implements of
agriculture, and were bound to present for the imperial table every
kind of game, fish, etc., found in the forests, rivers, and lakes of
the country where their camp was situated. This Russian regiment is
again mentioned in chap. XXXV.

“In chapter XXXVI. it is recorded that in the year 1332 the prince
Djang-ghi presented 170 Russian prisoners and received a pecuniary
reward. On the same page we read that clothes and corn were bestowed
on a thousand Russians. In the same year the prince Yen t’ie-mu-rh
presented 1500 Russian prisoners to the Chinese emperor, and another
prince, A-rh-ghia-shi-li, presented thirty.

“Finally, in the biography of Bo yen, chap. CXXXVIII., he is stated
to have been appointed in 1334 commander of the emperor’s life-guard,
composed of Mongols, Kipchaks, and Russians.” (E. BRETSCHNEIDER,
_Mediæval Researches_, II., pp. 79–81.)

Prof. Parker (_Asiatic Q. Rev._, Jan., 1904, p. 148) mentions the
appointment of a Russian Governor in 1337, and says: “It was the
practice of Princes in the West to send ‘presents’ of Russian captives.
In one case Yen Temur sent as many as 2500 in one batch.”

This manuscript has been discovered by Prof. Giovanni VACCA, who has
kindly sent me the following information regarding this curious
document not mentioned by Yule, Amat di S. Filippo, or Uzielli: MS.,
2048 cartac. sec. XV. (?), bearing the following faulty title: Storia
del Catay in lingua _spagnuola_; 66 leaves, the last of which with a
note by Piero Vaglienti. Writing is pretty clear, much like that of the
Catalan Map of 1375.

The text begins with the description of the city of Lop, and ends with
Georgia.

Fol. 65 _v_: “anaquesta provencia sisfa molta de seda evy ciutatz e
viles e castels assaiz e ay moltz bons azcos. Calre no se queus pusca
dir er perque fas vos si anaquest libre veus na sra benefit.”

Somewhat similar to the end of MS. 2207, Ottob., sec. XIV., membr. of
the Vatican Library (reproduced by Amat di S. Filippo):

“En ycelle province fait on moult de soyt. Et si y a moult de villes,
cites et chasteaux, moult bons et beau. Autre chose ne vous en scay
dire par quoi je vous fais fins en ce livre.”

Generally the text is correct; one does not find the great errors
contained in the Italian text given by Bartoli; it seems to follow very
closely the French text of the Société de Géographie edited in 1824.

Here is a description of the city of Gambalech (fol. 20 _r_–20 _v_)
reproducing very closely a legend of the Catalan Map of 1375.

“Les ver _que costa la ciutat de Camalech avia una grant Ciutat

The words _underlined_ are included almost verbatim in the Catalan Map.
Cf. H. CORDIER, _L’Extrême Orient dans l’Atlas Catalan_, p. 14.

The manuscript begins, fol. 1 _recto_: “Aci comensa lo libre de les
provincies et de les encontrades que sont sotz la seyoria del gran
Emperador del Catay | lo qual ha la seyoria del Gamballech et seyor de

                          SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE.


XII., pp. 307 _seq._

Sir Richard C. TEMPLE, has kindly sent me the following valuable notes:—

                     ANDAMAN AND NICOBAR ISLANDS.

                            _General Note._

Both the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been very closely studied
by Indian Government officials for about fifty years, and they and
the people occupying them are now thoroughly understood. There is
a considerable literature about them, ethnographical, historical,
geographical, and so on.

I have myself been Chief Commissioner, _i.e._, Administrator, of both
groups for the Government of India for ten years, 1894–1903, and went
deeply into the subjects connected with them, publishing a good many
papers about them in the _Indian Antiquary_, _Journal of the Royal
Society of Arts_, _Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute_, and
elsewhere. A general survey of all information to that date concerning
the islands will be found in the _Census of India_, 1901, vol. III.,
which I wrote; in this volume there is an extensive bibliography.
I also wrote the Andaman and Nicobar volumes of the Provincial and
District _Gazetteers_, published in 1909, in which current information
about them was again summarised. The most complete and reliable book
on the subject is E. H. MAN’S _Aboriginal Inhabitants of the Andaman
Islands_, London, 1883. KLOSS, _Andamans and Nicobars_, 1902, is a good
book. GERINI’S _Researches on Ptolemy’s Geography of Eastern Asia_,
1909, is valuable for the present purpose.

The best books on the Nicobars are MAN’S _Nicobarese Vocabulary_,
published in 1888, and MAN’S _Dictionary of the Central Nicobarese
Language_, published in 1889. I am still publishing Mr. MAN’S
_Dictionary of the South Andaman Language_ in the _Indian Antiquary_.

Recent information has so superseded old ideas about both groups of
islands that I suggest several of the notes in the 1903 edition of
Marco Polo be recast in reference to it.

With reference to the _Census Report_ noted above, I may remark
that this was the first Census Report ever made on the Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, and according to the custom of the Government of
India, such a report has to summarise all available information under
headings called Descriptive, Ethnography, Languages. Under the heading
Descriptive are sub-heads, Geography, Meteorology, Geography, History,
so that practically my _Census Report_ had to include in a summarised
form all the available information there was about the islands at that
time. It has a complete index, and I therefore suggest that it should
be referred to for any point on which information is required.

                               NICOBARS.

P. 307. _No king or chief_.—This is incorrect. They have distinct
village communities, governed each by its own chief, with definite
rules of property and succession and marriage. See _Census Report_. pp.
214, 212.

Pp. 307–308, Note 1. For Pulo Gomez, see BOWREY, _Countries Round the
Bay of Bengal_, ed. Temple, Hakluyt Society, p. 287 and footnote 4.
Bowrey (_c._ 1675) calls it Pullo Gomus, and a marine journal of 1675
calls it Polo Gomos.

_Origin of the name Nicobars_.—On this point I quote my paragraph
thereon on p. 185, _Census Report_.

“The situation of the Nicobars along the line of a very ancient trade
has caused them to be reported by traders and sea-farers through all
historical times. Gerini has fixed on Maniola for Car-Nicobar and
Agathodaimonos for Great Nicobar as the right ascription of Ptolemy’s
island names for this region. This ascription agrees generally with
the mediæval editions of Ptolemy. Yule’s guess that Ptolemy’s Barussæ
is the Nicobars is corrected by Gerini’s statement that it refers to
Nias. In the 1490 edition of Ptolemy, the Satyrorum Insulæ placed
to the south-east of the Malay Peninsula, where the Anamba islands
east of Singapore, also on the line of the old route to China, really
are, have opposite them the remark:—_qui has inhabitant caudas habere
dicuntur_—no doubt in confusion with the Nicobars. They are without
doubt the Lankhabalus of the _Arab Relations_ (851 A.D.), which term
may be safely taken as a misapprehension or mistranscription of some
form of Nicobar (through Nakkavar, Nankhabar), thus affording the
earliest reference to the modern term. But there is an earlier mention
of them by I-Tsing, the Chinese Buddhist monk, in his travels, 672
A.D., under the name of the Land of the Naked People (Lo-jen-kuo), and
this seems to have been the recognised name for them in China at that
time. ‘Land of the Naked’ translates Nakkavaram, the name by which the
islands appear in the great Tanjore inscription of 1050. This name
reappears in Marco Polo’s Necuveran 1292, in Rashiduddin’s Nakwaram
1300, and in Friar Odoric’s Nicoveran 1322, which are the lineal
ancestors of the 15th and 16th Century Portuguese Nacabar and Nicubar
and the modern Nicobar. The name has been Nicobar since at least 1560.
The fanciful story of the tails is repeated by the Swede Kjœping as
late as 1647.”

Nicobar clearly means the Land of the Naked, but that does not
correctly describe the people. I have never seen either a naked man or
woman in the Nicobars. The men are nearly naked, but they wear a string
round the waist with a very small loincloth. The string is so tied as
to leave two long streamers behind, which have very much the appearance
of a tail as the man walks along, and no doubt this gave rise to the
idea that they were tailed men. The women wear a petticoat coming below
the knees, generally red.

The Nicobarese are not savages and live in well-built clean villages,
are born traders, and can calculate accurately up to very high figures.
They deliberately do not cultivate, because by using their cocoanuts
as currency they can buy from Chinese, Malay, Burmese, Indian, and
other traders all that they want in the way of food and comforts. They
are good gardeners of fruit. They seem to have borne their present
characteristics through all historical times.

Pp. 307–308, Note 1.—Nancowry is a native name for two adjacent
islands, now known as Camorta and Nankauri, and I do not think it has
anything to do with the name Nicobar. For a list of the geographical
names of the islands, see _Census Report_, pp. 179–180.

_Race and Dialect_.—The Nicobarese are generally classed as Malays,
_i.e._, they are “Wild Malays,” and probably in reality an overflow of
Mon tribes from the mainland of the Malay Peninsula (_Census Report_,
p. 250). They are a finely built race of people, but they have rendered
their faces ugly by the habit of chewing betel with lime until they
have destroyed their teeth by incrustations of lime, so that they
cannot close their lips properly.

I think it is a mistake to class the Nicobarese as Rakshasas or demons,
a term that would apply in Indian parlance more properly to the
Andamanese.

The Nicobarese are all one race, including the Shom Pen, for long a
mysterious tribe in the centre of Great Nicobar, but now well known.
They speak dialects of one language, though the dialects as spoken are
mutually unintelligible. There is no Negrito tribe in the Nicobars. A
detailed grammar of the language will be found in the _Census Report_,
pp. 255–284.

The Nicobarese have long been pirates, and one of the reasons for the
occupation of their islands by the Indian Government was to put down
the piracy which had become dangerous to general navigation, but which
now no longer exists.

P. 309.—The great article of trade is the cocoanut, of which a detailed
account will be found in the _Census Report_, pp. 169–174, 219–220,
243. I would suggest the recasting of the remarks on the products of
the Nicobars in your note on p. 309 in view of the statements made in
those pages of the Report, bearing in mind that the details of the
Nicobar Islands are now practically as well known as those relating to
any other part of the East.

P. 312.—The Nicobarese tradition is that they are descended from a
man and a dog, but this is only one phase of the ordinary Far Eastern
animal-descent story.

The projecting teeth mentioned by Colonel Man are common in the
Nicobars in the case of adults only, usually confined to men and women
advanced in life. They are not natural, but caused, as stated above,
by the excessive use of betel and lime, which forms a dark unsightly
incrustation on the teeth and finally destroys them. Children and youth
of both sexes have good white normal teeth.

                              NARCONDAM.

Narcondam, an island I know well, has a separate bibliography of its
own. It belongs to the Sunda group of volcanoes, but it has been so
long extinct that there are no obvious signs now of its ever having
been active. It has a species of hornbill which I have captured and
shot that has differentiated itself from all others. I do not think,
therefore, it can have been recognised as a volcano by mariners in
historical times, and consequently the derivation of Narakakundam is to
my mind doubtful. The obvious volcano in the neighbourhood is Barren
Island, which is still alive.

                               ANDAMANS.

Pp. 309–310, Note 1.—The Andamanese are not an ill-looking race, and
are not negroes in any sense, but it is true that they are Negritos
in the lowest known state of barbarism, and that they are an isolated
race. Reasons for the isolation will be found in the _Census Report_,
p. 51, but I should not call their condition, mentally or physically,
degraded. The mental characteristics of the race will be found on pp.
59–61 of the _Census Report_, and for your information I here extract
from my remarks thereon the section on character.

“In childhood the Andamanese are possessed of a bright intelligence,
which, however, soon reaches its climax, and the adult may be compared
in this respect with the civilised child of ten or twelve. He has never
had any sort of agriculture, nor until the English taught him the use
of dogs did he ever domesticate any kind of animal or bird, nor did he
teach himself to turn turtle or to use hook and line in fishing. He
cannot count, and all his ideas are hazy, inaccurate, and ill-defined.
He has never developed unaided any idea of drawing or making a tally
or record for any purpose, but he readily understands a sketch or plan
when shown him. He soon becomes mentally tired, and is apt to break
down physically under mental training.

“He retains throughout life the main characteristics of the child:
of very short but strong memory, suspicious of but hospitable to
strangers, ungrateful, imitative and watchful of his companions
and neighbours, vain, and under the spur of vanity industrious and
persevering, teachable up to a quickly reached limit, fond of undefined
games and practical jokes, too happy and careless to be affected in
temperament by his superstitions, too careless indeed to store water
even for a voyage, plucky but not courageous, reckless only from
ignorance or from inappreciation of danger, selfish but not without
generosity, chivalry or a sense of honour, petulant, hasty of temper,
entirely irresponsible and childish in action in his wrath, and equally
quick to forget, affectionate, lively in his movements, and exceedingly
taking in his moments of good temper. At these times the Andamanese
are gentle and pleasant to each other, considerate to the aged, the
weakly or the helpless, and to captives, kind to their wives and proud
of their children, whom they often over-pet; but when angered, cruel,
jealous, treacherous and vindictive, and always unstable. They are
bright and merry companions, talkative, inquisitive and restless,
busy in their own pursuits, keen sportsmen and naturally independent,
absorbed in the chase from sheer love of it and other physical
occupations, and not lustful, indecent, or indecently abusive.

“As the years advance they are apt to become intractable, masterful,
and quarrelsome. A people to like but not to trust. Exceedingly
conservative and bound up in ancestral custom, not amenable to
civilisation, all the teachings of years bestowed upon some of them
having introduced no abstract ideas among the tribesmen, and changed no
habit in practical matters affecting comfort, health, and mode of life.
Irresponsibility is a characteristic, though instances of a keen sense
of responsibility are not wanting. Several Andamanese can take charge
of the steering of a large steam launch through dangerous channels,
exercising then caution, daring, and skill though not to an European
extent, and the present (1901) dynamo-man of the electric lighting on
Ross Island is an Andamanese, while the wire-man is a Nicobarese, both
of whom exhibit the liveliest sense of their responsibilities, though
retaining a deep-rooted and unconquerable fear of the dynamo and wires
when at work. The Nicobarese shows, as is to be expected, the higher
order of intellect. Another Andamanese was used by Portman for years as
an accountant and kept his accounts in English accurately and well.

“The intelligence of the women is good, though not as a rule equal
to that of the men. In old age, however, they frequently exhibit a
considerable mental capacity which is respected. Several women trained
in a former local Mission Orphanage from early childhood have shown
much mental aptitude and capacity, the ‘savagery’ in them, however,
only dying down as they grew older. They can read and write well,
understand and speak English correctly, have acquired European habits
completely, and possess much shrewdness and common sense: one has
herself taught her Andamanese husband, the dynamo-man above mentioned,
to read and write English and induced him to join the Government House
Press as a compositor. She writes a well-expressed and correctly-spelt
letter in English, and has a shrewd notion of the value of money. Such
women, when the instability of youth is past, make good ‘ayas,’ as
their menkind make good waiters at table.

“The highest general type of intelligence yet noticed is in the Jarawa
tribe.”

P. 310. _The name Andaman_.—To my mind the modern Andaman is the
Malay Handuman = Hanuman, representing “monkey” or savage aboriginal
antagonist of the Aryans = also the Rakshasa. Individuals of the race,
when seen in the streets of Calcutta in 1883, were at once recognised
as Rakshasas. It may amuse you to know that the Andamanese returned the
compliment, and to them all Orientals are Chauga or Ancestral Ghosts,
_i.e._, demons (see _Census Report_, pp. 44–45 for reasons). I agree
with you that Angamanain is an Arabic dual, the Great and the Little
Andaman. To a voyager who did not land, the North, Middle, and South
Andaman would appear as one great island, whereas the strait separating
these three islands from the Little Andaman would be quite distinctly
seen.

P. 311. _Cannibalism_.—The charge of cannibalism is entirely untrue. I
quote here my paragraph as to how it arose (_Census Report_, p. 48).

“The charge of cannibalism seems to have arisen from three observations
of the old mariners. The Andamanese attacked and murdered without
provocation every stranger they could on his landing; they burnt his
body (as they did in fact that of every enemy); and they had weird
all-night dances round fires. Combine these three observations with the
unprovoked murder of one of themselves, and the fear aroused by such
occurrences in a far land in ignorant mariners’ minds, century after
century, and a persistent charge of cannibalism is almost certain to be
the result.”

The real reason for the Andamanese taking and killing every stranger
that they could was that for centuries the Malays had used the islands
as one of their pirate bases, and had made a practice of capturing the
inhabitants to sell as slaves in the Peninsula and Siam.

P. 311. _Navigation_.—It is true that they do not quit their own coasts
in canoes, and I have always doubted the truth of the assertions that
any of them ever found their way to any Nicobar island.

Andamanese men go naked, but the only Andamanese women that I have
ever seen entirely naked in their own jungles are of the inland tribe
of Jarawas.

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TRAVELS OF MARCO POLO — VOLUME 2 ***


    

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
