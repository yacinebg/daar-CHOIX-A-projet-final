MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES.


OLD MOTHER GOOSE.

    OLD Mother Goose, when
      She wanted to wander,
    Would ride through the air
      On a very fine gander.

    Mother Goose had a house,
      'Twas built in a wood,
    Where an owl at the door
      For sentinel stood.

    This is her son Jack,
      A plain-looking lad,
    He is not very good,
      Nor yet very bad.

    She sent him to market,
      A live goose he bought,
    "Here, mother," says he,
      "It will not go for nought."

    Jack's goose and her gander
      Grew very fond,
    They'd both eat together,
      Or swim in one pond.




[Illustration: "SHE SENT HIM TO MARKET, A LIVE GOOSE HE BOUGHT."]


    Jack found one fine morning
      As I have been told,
    His goose had laid him
      An egg of pure gold.

    Jack rode to his mother,
      The news for to tell,
    She called him a good boy
      And said it was well.

    Jack sold his gold egg
      To a rogue of a Jew,
    Who cheated him out of
      The half of his due.

    Then Jack went a-courting
      A lady so gay,
    As fair as the lily,
      And sweet as the May.

    The Jew and the Squire
      Came behind his back,
    And began to belabour
      The sides of poor Jack.

    And then the gold egg
      Was thrown into the sea,

[Illustration]

    When Jack he jumped in,
      And got it back presently.

    The Jew got the goose,
      Which he vowed he would kill,
    Resolving at once
      His pockets to fill.

[Illustration]

    Jack's mother came in,
      And caught the goose soon,
    And mounting its back,
      Flew up to the moon.




[Illustration]


    BOYS and girls, come out to play,
    The moon does shine as bright as day,
      Leave your supper, and leave your sleep,
      And meet your playfellows in the street;
    Come with a whoop, and come with a call,
    And come with a good will, or not at all.
      Up the ladder and down the wall,
      A halfpenny loaf will serve us all.
    You find milk and I'll find flour,
    And we'll have a pudding in half an hour.

THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER.[A]


    THE sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
    He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright--
    And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night.

    The moon was shining sulkily,
      Because she thought the sun
    Had got no business to be there
      After the day was done--
    "It's very rude of him," she said,
      "To come and spoil the fun!"

    The sea was wet as wet could be,
      The sands were dry as dry.
    You could not see a cloud, because
      No cloud was in the sky:
    No birds were flying overhead--
      There were no birds to fly.

    The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Were walking close at hand;
    They wept like anything to see
      Such quantities of sand:
    "If this were only cleared away,"
      They said, "it _would_ be grand!"

    "If seven maids with seven mops
      Swept it for half a year,
    Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
      "That they could get it clear?"
    "I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
      And shed a bitter tear.

[Illustration]

    "O Oysters, come and walk with us!"
      The Walrus did beseech.
    "A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
      Along the briny beach:
    We cannot do with more than four,
      To give a hand to each."

    The eldest Oyster looked at him,
      But never a word he said:
    The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
      And shook his heavy head--
    Meaning to say he did not choose
      To leave the oyster-bed.

    But four young Oysters hurried up,
      All eager for the treat:
    Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
      Their shoes were clean and neat--
    And this was odd, because, you know,
      They hadn't any feet.

    Four other Oysters followed them,
      And yet another four;
    And thick and fast they came at last,
      And more, and more, and more--
    All hopping through the frothy waves,
      And scrambling to the shore.

    The Walrus and the Carpenter
      Walked on a mile or so,
    And then they rested on a rock
      Conveniently low:
    And all the little Oysters stood
      And waited in a row.

    "The time has come," the Walrus said,
      "To talk of many things:
    Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
      Of cabbages--and kings--
    And why the sea is boiling hot--
      And whether pigs have wings."

    "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
      "Before we have our chat;
    For some of us are out of breath,
      And all of us are fat!"
    "No hurry!" said the Carpenter.
      They thanked him much for that.

[Illustration]

    "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
      "Is what we chiefly need:
    Pepper and vinegar besides
      Are very good indeed--
    Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,
      We can begin to feed."

    "But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
      Turning a little blue.
    "After such kindness, that would be
      A dismal thing to do!"
    "The night is fine," the Walrus said.
      "Do you admire the view?

    "It was so kind of you to come!
      And you are very nice!"
    The Carpenter said nothing but
      "Cut us another slice:
    I wish you were not quite so deaf--
      I've had to ask you twice!"

    "It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
      "To play them such a trick,
    After we've brought them out so far,
      And made them trot so quick!"
    The Carpenter said nothing but
      "The butter's spread too thick!"

[Illustration]

    "I weep for you," the Walrus said:
      "I deeply sympathize."
    With sobs and tears he sorted out
      Those of the largest size,
    Holding his pocket-handkerchief
      Before his streaming eyes.

    "O Oysters," said the Carpenter,
      "You've had a pleasant run!
    Shall we be trotting home again?"
      But answer there came none--
    And this was scarcely odd, because
      They'd eaten every one.

    Not I, said the sheep; oh, no,
    I would not treat a poor bird so;
    I gave the wool the nest to line,
    But the nest was none of mine.
    Baa! baa! said the sheep; oh, no!
    I wouldn't treat a poor bird so.

THE MARRIAGE OF COCK ROBIN AND JENNY WREN.


    IT was on a merry time,
      When Jenny Wren was young,
    So neatly as she danced,
      And so sweetly as she sung,--

    Robin Redbreast lost his heart:
      He was a gallant bird;
    He doffed his hat to Jenny,
      And thus to her he said:

[Illustration]

    "My dearest Jenny Wren,
      If you will but be mine,
    You shall dine on cherry-pie,
      And drink nice currant-wine.

    "I'll dress you like a goldfinch,
      Or like a peacock gay;
    So if you'll have me, Jenny,
      Let us appoint the day."

[Illustration]

    Jenny blushed behind her fan,
      And thus declared her mind:
    "Then let it be to-morrow, Bob,--
      I take your offer kind;

    "Cherry-pie is very good,
      So is currant-wine;
    But I'll wear my russet gown,
      And never dress too fine."

[Illustration]

    Robin rose up early,
      At the break of day;
    He flew to Jenny Wren's house,
      To sing a roundelay.

    He met the Cock and Hen,
      And bade the Cock declare,
    This was his wedding-day
      With Jenny Wren the fair.

    The Cock then blew his horn,
      To let the neighbours know
    This was Robin's wedding-day,
      And they might see the show.

[Illustration]

    At first came Parson Rook,
      With his spectacles and band;
    And one of Mother Hubbard's books
      He held within his hand.

    Then followed him the Lark,
      For he could sweetly sing,
    And he was to be the clerk
      At Cock Robin's wedding.

    He sang of Robin's love
      For Little Jenny Wren;
    And when he came unto the end,
      Then he began again.

    The Goldfinch came on next,
      To give away the Bride;
    The Linnet, being bridesmaid,
      Walked by Jenny's side;

    And as she was a-walking,
      Said, "Upon my word,
    I think that your Cock Robin
      Is a very pretty bird."

    The Blackbird and the Thrush,
      And charming Nightingale,
    Whose sweet "jug" sweetly echoes
      Through every grove and dale;

    The Sparrow and Tomtit,
      And many more, were there;
    All came to see the wedding
      Of Jenny Wren the fair.

    The Bullfinch walked by Robin,
      And thus to him did say,
    "Pray mark, friend Robin Redbreast,
      That Goldfinch dressed so gay:

    "What though her gay apparel
      Becomes her very well,
    Yet Jenny's modest dress and look
      Must bear away the bell."

[Illustration]

    Then came the Bride and Bridegroom;
      Quite plainly was she dressed,
    And blushed so much, her cheeks were
      As red as Robin's breast.

    But Robin cheered her up;
      "My pretty Jen," said he,
    "We're going to be married,
      And happy we shall be."

    "Oh, then," says Parson Rook,
      "Who gives this maid away?"
    "I do," says the Goldfinch,
      "And her fortune I will pay:

    "Here's a bag of grain of many sorts,
      And other things beside:
    Now happy be the bridegroom,
      And happy be the bride!"

    "And will you have her, Robin,
      To be your wedded wife?"
    "Yes, I will," says Robin,
      "And love her all my life!"

    "And you will have him, Jenny,
      Your husband now to be?"
    "Yes, I will," says Jenny,
      "And love him heartily!"

    Then on her finger fair
      Cock Robin put the ring;
    "You're married now," says Parson Rook,
      While the Lark aloud did sing:

    "Happy be the bridegroom,
      And happy be the bride!
    And may not man, nor bird, nor beast,
      This happy pair divide!"

[Illustration]

    The birds were asked to dine,
      Not Jenny's friends alone,
    But every pretty songster
      That had Cock Robin known.

    They had a cherry-pie,
      Besides some currant-wine,
    And every guest brought something,
      That sumptuous they might dine.

    Now they all sat or stood,
      To eat and to drink;
    And every one said what
      He happened to think.

[Illustration]

    They each took a bumper,
      And drank to the pair,
    Cock Robin the bridegroom,
      And Jenny the fair.

    The dinner-things removed,
      They all began to sing;
    And soon they made the place
      Near a mile round to ring.

    The concert it was fine;
      And every bird tried
    Who best should sing for Robin,
      And Jenny Wren the bride.

[Illustration]

    When in came the Cuckoo,
      And made a great rout;
    He caught hold of Jenny,
      And pulled her about.

    Cock Robin was angry,
      And so was the Sparrow,
    Who fetched in a hurry
      His bow and his arrow.

    His aim then he took,
      But he took it not right;
    His skill was not good,
      Or he shot in a fright;

    For the Cuckoo he missed,
      But Cock Robin he killed!--
    And all the birds mourned
      That his blood was so spilled.

    Saying "Amen" like a clerk.

[Illustration]

    This is the Linnet,
    And a link with fire in it.

    Who'll be chief mourner?
      I, said the Dove,

    I'll be chief mourner.

    This is the Dove,
    Who Cock Robin did love.

[Illustration]

      "We would rather stay up here;
    If we ventured down this morning,
      You would eat us up, I fear."

    One, the finest of the cherries,
      Dangled from a slender twig;
    "You are beautiful," said Freddie,
      "Red and ripe, and oh, how big!"

    "Catch me," said the cherry, "catch me,
      Little master, if you can."

    Freddie jumped, and tried to reach it,
      Standing high upon his toes;

      Out of the mustard-pot,

    He went to ride a spotted cow,
      That had a little calf,
    She threw him down upon the ground,
      Which made the people laugh.

    Once Simon made a great snowball,
      And brought it in to roast;
    He laid it down before the fire,
      And soon the ball was lost.

    He went to slide upon the ice,
      Before the ice would bear;
    Then he plunged in above his knees,

    He washed himself with blacking-ball,
      Because he had no soap;
    Then said unto his mother,

    Simple Simon went to look
      If plums grew on a thistle;
    He pricked his fingers very much,

                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    "Indeed, Mrs. Mouse," replied the Frog,
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    "A cold has made me as hoarse as a hog."
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    "Since you have caught cold, Mr. Frog," Mousey said,
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    "I'll sing you a song that I have just made."
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    But while they were all a merry-making,
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    A cat and her kittens came tumbling in.
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    The cat she seized the rat by the crown;
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    The kittens they pulled the little mouse down.
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    This put Mr. Frog in a terrible fright;
                            Heigho, says Rowley.
    He took up his hat, and he wished them good night.
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

    But as Froggy was crossing over a brook,
                            Heigho, says Rowley,
    A lily-white duck came and gobbled him up.
                            With a rowley powley, &c.

[Illustration]

    So there was an end of one, two, and three,

    One day (the sun was warm and bright,

    Cock Robin said, "My little dears,

DAME DUCK'S LESSONS TO HER DUCKLINGS.


    OLD MOTHER DUCK has hatched a brood
      Of ducklings, small and callow:
    Their little wings are short, their down
      Is mottled grey and yellow.

    There is a quiet little stream,
      That runs into the moat,
    Where tall green sedges spread their leaves,
      And water-lilies float.

    Close by the margin of the brook
      The old Duck made her nest,
    Of straw, and leaves, and withered grass,
      And down from her own breast.

    And there she sat for four long weeks,
      In rainy days and fine,
    Until the Ducklings all came out--
      Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

    One peeped out from beneath her wing,
      One scrambled on her back:
    "That's very rude," said old Dame Duck,
      "Get off! quack, quack, quack, quack!"

    "'T is close," said Dame Duck, shoving out
      The egg-shells with her bill,
    "Besides, it never suits young ducks
      To keep them sitting still."

    So, rising from her nest, she said,
      "Now, children, look at me:
    A well-bred duck should waddle so,
      From side to side--d'ye see?"

    "Yes," said the little ones, and then
      She went on to explain:
    "A well-bred duck turns in its toes
      As I do--try again."

    "Yes," said the Ducklings, waddling on.
      "That's better," said their mother;
    "But well-bred ducks walk in a row,
      Straight--one behind another."

    "Yes," said the little Ducks again,
      All waddling in a row:
    "Now to the pond," said old Dame Duck--
      Splash, splash! and in they go.

    "Let me swim first," said old Dame Duck,
      "To this side, now to that;
    There, snap at those great brown-winged flies,
      They make young ducklings fat.

    "Now when you reach the poultry-yard,
      The hen-wife, Molly Head,
    Will feed you, with the other fowls,
      On bran and mashed-up bread;

    "The hens will peck and fight, but mind,
      I hope that all of you
    Will gobble up the food as fast
      As well-bred ducks should do.

    "You'd better get into the dish,
      Unless it is too small;
    In that case, I should use my foot,
      And overturn it all."

    The Ducklings did as they were bid,
      And found the plan so good,
    That, from that day, the other fowls
      Got hardly any food.

    Caterpillar, worm, and grub,

    When the mother-bird returns,
      And finds them still and good,
    She will give them each, by turns,
      A proper share of food.

    She has hopped from spray to spray,
      And peeped with knowing eye
    Into all the folded leaves
      Where caterpillars lie.

    She has searched among the grass,
      And flown from tree to tree,
    Catching gnats and flies, to feed
      Her little family.

    I have seen the Linnets chirp,
      And shake their downy wings:
    They are pleased to see her come,
      And pleased with what she brings.

    And where she was going, I couldn't but ask it,
      For in her hand she carried a broom.

    Old woman, old woman, old woman, quoth I,
      O whither, O whither, O whither so high?

    When I was a bachelor, I lived by myself,
    And all the meat I got I put upon a shelf;
    The rats and the mice did lead me such a life,
    That I went to London, to get myself a wife.

    The streets were so broad, and the lanes were so narrow,
    I could not get my wife home without a wheelbarrow,
    The wheelbarrow broke, my wife got a fall,
    Down tumbled wheelbarrow, little wife, and all.




    Robin and Richard were two pretty men,
    They lay in bed till the clock struck ten;

    You go on with bottle and bag,
    And I'll come after with jolly Jack Nag."




    Blow, wind, blow, and go, mill, go,

THE FOX AND THE FARMER.


    A FOX jumped up on a moonlight night,
    The stars were shining, and all things bright;
    "Oh, ho!" said the Fox, "it's a very fine night
      For me to go through the town, heigho!"

    The Fox when he came to yonder stile,
    He lifted his ears, and he listened awhile;
    "Oh, ho!" said the Fox, "it's but a short mile
      From this unto yonder town, heigho!"

    The Fox when he came to the farmer's gate,
    Whom should he see but the farmer's Drake;
    "I love you well for your master's sake,
      And long to be picking your bones, heigho!"

    The grey Goose ran right round the haystack.
    "Oh, ho!" said the Fox, "you are very fat;
    You'll do very well to ride on my back,
      From this into yonder town, heigho!"

    The farmer's wife she jumped out of bed,
    And out of the window she popped her head;
    "Oh, husband! oh, husband! the Geese are all dead,
      For the Fox has been through the town, heigho!"

    The farmer he loaded his pistol with lead,
    And shot the old rogue of a Fox through the head;
    "Ah, ha!" said the farmer, "I think you're quite dead,
      And no more you'll trouble the town, heigho!"

    I spent a penny of it, I spent another,
      And I took nothing home to my wife.

    Oh, my little nothing, my pretty little nothing,
      What will nothing buy for my wife?
    I have nothing, I spend nothing,
      I love nothing better than my wife.

THE OLD WOMAN AND HER PIG.

AN old woman was sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked
sixpence. "What," said she, "shall I do with this little sixpence? I
will go to market, and buy a little pig." As she was coming home, she
came to a stile: the piggy would not go over the stile.

She went a little farther, and she met a dog. So she said to the dog--

    "Dog, dog, bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the dog would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a stick. So she said--

    "Stick, stick, beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile,
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the stick would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a fire. So she said--

    "Fire, fire, burn stick;
     Stick won't beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the fire would not.

She went a little farther, and she met some water. So she said--

[Illustration: "FIRE, FIRE, BURN STICK."]

    "Water, water, quench fire;
     Fire won't burn stick;
     Stick won't beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the water would not.

She went a little farther, and she met an ox. So she said--

    "Ox, ox, drink water;
     Water won't quench fire;
     Fire won't burn stick;
     Stick won't beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the ox would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a butcher. So she said--

    "Butcher, butcher, kill ox;
     Ox won't drink water;
     Water won't quench fire;
     Fire won't burn stick;

[Illustration: "BUTCHER, BUTCHER, KILL OX."]

    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Piggy won't get over the stile;
    And I shan't get home to-night."

But the butcher would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a rope. So she said--

    "Rope, rope, hang butcher;
     Butcher won't kill ox;
     Ox won't drink water;
     Water won't quench fire;
     Fire won't burn stick;
     Stick won't beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the rope would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a rat. So she said--

    "Rat, rat, gnaw rope;
     Rope won't hang butcher;
     Butcher won't kill ox;
     Ox won't drink water;

[Illustration: "RAT, RAT, GNAW ROPE."]

    Water won't quench fire;
    Fire won't burn stick;
    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Piggy won't get over the stile;
    And I shan't get home to-night."

But the rat would not. She went a little farther, and she met a cat. So
she said--

    "Cat, cat, kill rat;
     Rat won't gnaw rope;
     Rope won't hang butcher;
     Butcher won't kill ox;
     Ox won't drink water;
     Water won't quench fire;
     Fire won't burn stick;
     Stick won't beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the cat said to her, "If you will go to yonder cow, and fetch me a
saucer of milk, I will kill the rat." So away went the old woman to the
cow, and said--

[Illustration: "COW, COW, GIVE ME A SAUCER OF MILK."]

    "Cow, cow, give me a saucer of milk;
     Cat won't kill rat;
     Rat won't gnaw rope;
     Rope won't hang butcher;
     Butcher won't kill ox;
     Ox won't drink water;
     Water won't quench fire;
     Fire won't burn stick;
     Stick won't beat dog;
     Dog won't bite pig;
     Piggy won't get over the stile;
     And I shan't get home to-night."

But the cow said to her, "If you will go to yonder haymakers, and fetch
me a wisp of hay, I'll give you the milk." So away the old woman went to
the haymakers, and said--

    "Haymakers, give me a wisp of hay;
     Cow won't give me milk;
     Cat won't kill rat;
     Rat won't gnaw rope;
     Rope won't hang butcher;
     Butcher won't kill ox;
     Ox won't drink water;
     Water won't quench fire;

[Illustration: "HAYMAKERS, GIVE ME A WISP OF HAY."]

    Fire won't burn stick;
    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Piggy won't get over the stile;
    And I shan't get home to-night."

But the haymakers said to her,--"If you will go to yonder stream, and
fetch us a bucket of water, we'll give you the hay." So away the old
woman went; but when she got to the stream, she found the bucket was
full of holes. So she covered the bottom with pebbles, and then filled
the bucket with water, and away she went back with it to the haymakers;
and they gave her a wisp of hay.

As soon as the cow had eaten the hay, she gave the old woman the milk;
and away she went with it in a saucer to the cat. As soon as the cat had
lapped up the milk--

    The cat began to kill the rat;
    The rat began to gnaw the rope;
    The rope began to hang the butcher;
    The butcher began to kill the ox;
    The ox began to drink the water;
    The water began to quench the fire;
    The fire began to burn the stick;
    The stick began to beat the dog;
    The dog began to bite the pig;

[Illustration: "THE CAT BEGAN TO KILL THE RAT."]

    The little pig in a fright jumped over the stile;
    And so the old woman got home that night.

[Illustration: "AWAY WENT GILPIN, AND AWAY WENT POSTBOY AT HIS HEELS."]




THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN.

SHOWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE INTENDED, AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN.


    JOHN GILPIN was a citizen
      Of credit and renown,
    A train-band captain eke was he,
      Of famous London town.

    John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,
      "Though wedded we have been
    These twice ten tedious years, yet we
      No holiday have seen.

    "To-morrow is our wedding-day,
      And we will then repair
    Unto the "Bell" at Edmonton,
      All in a chaise and pair.

    "My sister, and my sister's child,
      Myself, and children three,
    Will fill the chaise; so you must ride
      On horseback after we."

    He soon replied, "I do admire
      Of womankind but one,
    And you are she, my dearest dear,
      Therefore it shall be done.

    "I am a linendraper bold,
      As all the world doth know,
    And my good friend the calender
      Will lend his horse to go."

    Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, "That's well said;
      And for that wine is dear,
    We will be furnished with our own,
      Which is both bright and clear."

    John Gilpin kissed his loving wife;
      O'erjoyed was he to find,
    That though on pleasure she was bent,
      She had a frugal mind.

[Illustration]

    The morning came, the chaise was brought,
      But yet was not allowed
    To drive up to the door, lest all
      Should say that she was proud.

    So three doors off the chaise was stayed,
      Where they did all get in;
    Six precious souls, and all agog
      To dash through thick and thin.

    Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,
      Were never folks so glad!
    The stones did rattle underneath,
      As if Cheapside were mad.

    John Gilpin at his horse's side
      Seized fast the flowing mane,
    And up he got, in haste to ride,
      But soon came down again.

    For saddletree scarce reached had he,
      His journey to begin,
    When, turning round his head, he saw
      Three customers come in.

    So down he came; for loss of time,
      Although it grieved him sore,
    Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,
      Would trouble him much more.

    'Twas long before the customers
      Were suited to their mind,
    When Betty screaming came downstairs,
      "The wine is left behind!"

    "Good lack!" quoth he, "yet bring it me,
      My leathern belt likewise,
    In which I bear my trusty sword
      When I do exercise."

    Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)
      Had two stone bottles found,
    To hold the liquor that she loved,
      And keep it safe and sound.

    Each bottle had a curling ear,
      Through which the belt he drew,
    And hung a bottle on each side,
      To make his balance true.

    Then over all, that he might be
      Equipped from top to toe,
    His long red cloak, well brushed and neat,
      He manfully did throw.

    Now see him mounted once again
      Upon his nimble steed,
    Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,
      With caution and good heed.

    But finding soon a smoother road
      Beneath his well-shod feet,
    The snorting beast began to trot,
      Which galled him in his seat.

    "So, fair and softly!" John he cried,
      But John he cried in vain;
    That trot became a gallop soon,
      In spite of curb and rein.

    So stooping down, as needs he must
      Who cannot sit upright,
    He grasped the mane with both his hands,
      And eke with all his might.

    His horse, who never in that sort
      Had handled been before,
    What thing upon his back had got,
      Did wonder more and more.

    Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;
      Away went hat and wig;

[Illustration]

    He little dreamt, when he set out,
      Of running such a rig.

    The wind did blow, the cloak did fly
      Like streamer long and gay,
    Till, loop and button failing both,
      At last it flew away.

    Then might all people well discern
      The bottles he had slung;
    A bottle swinging at each side,
      As hath been said or sung.

    The dogs did bark, the children screamed,
      Up flew the windows all;
    And every soul cried out, "Well done!"
      As loud as he could bawl.

    Away went Gilpin--who but he?
      His fame soon spread around:
    "He carries weight! he rides a race!
      'Tis for a thousand pound!"

    And still as fast as he drew near,
      'Twas wonderful to view
    How in a trice the turnpike-men
      Their gates wide open threw.

    And now, as he went bowing down
      His reeking head full low,
    The bottles twain behind his back
      Were shattered at a blow.

    Down ran the wine into the road,
      Most piteous to be seen,
    Which made the horses flanks to smoke
      As they had basted been.

    But still he seemed to carry weight,
      With leathern girdle braced;
    For all might see the bottle-necks
      Still dangling at his waist.

    Thus all through merry Islington
      These gambols he did play,
    Until he came unto the Wash
      Of Edmonton so gay;

    And there he threw the wash about
      On both sides of the way,
    Just like unto a trundling mop,
      Or a wild goose at play.

    At Edmonton his loving wife
      From the balcony spied
    Her tender husband, wondering much
      To see how he did ride.

    "Stop, stop, John Gilpin!--Here's the house!"
      They all at once did cry;
    "The dinner waits, and we are tired;"
      Said Gilpin--"So am I!"

    But yet his horse was not a whit
      Inclined to tarry there;
    For why?--his owner had a house
      Full ten miles off, at Ware.

    So like an arrow swift he flew,
      Shot by an archer strong;
    So did he fly--which brings me to
      The middle of my song.

    Away went Gilpin out of breath
      And sore against his will,
    Till at his friend the calender's,
      His horse at last stood still.

    The calender, amazed to see
      His neighbour in such trim,
    Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,
      And thus accosted him:

[Illustration]

    "What news? what news? your tidings tell;
      Tell me you must and shall--
    Say why bareheaded you are come,
      Or why you come at all?"

    Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,
      And loved a timely joke;
    And thus unto the calender
      In merry guise he spoke:

    "I came because your horse would come:
      And, if I well forebode,
    My hat and wig will soon be here,
      They are upon the road."

    The calender, right glad to find
      His friend in merry pin,
    Returned him not a single word,
      But to the house went in;

    Whence straight he came with hat and wig,
      A wig that flowed behind,
    A hat not much the worse for wear,
      Each comely in its kind.

    He held them up, and in his turn
      Thus showed his ready wit,
    "My head is twice as big as yours,
      They therefore needs must fit.

    "But let me scrape the dirt away,
      That hangs upon your face;

[Illustration]

    And stop and eat, for well you may
      Be in a hungry case."

    Said John, "It is my wedding-day,
      And all the world would stare
    If wife should dine at Edmonton,
      And I should dine at Ware."

    So turning to his horse, he said,
      "I am in haste to dine;
    'Twas for your pleasure you came here,
      You shall go back for mine."

    Ah! luckless speech, and bootless boast!
      For which he paid full dear;
    For while he spake, a braying ass
      Did sing most loud and clear;

    Whereat his horse did snort, as he
      Had heard a lion roar,
    And galloped off with all his might,
      As he had done before.

    Away went Gilpin, and away
      Went Gilpin's hat and wig:
    He lost them sooner than at first,
      For why--they were too big.

    Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw
      Her husband posting down
    Into the country far away,
      She pulled out half-a-crown;

[Illustration]

    And thus unto the youth she said
      That drove them to the "Bell,"
    "This shall be yours when you bring back
      My husband safe and well."

    The youth did ride, and soon did meet
      John coming back amain;
    Whom in a trice he tried to stop,
      By catching at his rein;

    But not performing what he meant,
      And gladly would have done,
    The frighted steed he frighted more,
      And made him faster run.

    Away went Gilpin, and away
      Went postboy at his heels,
    The postboy's horse right glad to miss
      The lumbering of the wheels.

    Six gentlemen upon the road,
      Thus seeing Gilpin fly,
    With postboy scampering in the rear,
      They raised the hue and cry.

    "Stop thief! stop thief! a highwayman!"
      Not one of them was mute;
    And all and each that passed that way
      Did join in the pursuit.

    And now the turnpike-gates again
      Flew open in short space;

[Illustration]

    The toll-men thinking, as before,
      That Gilpin rode a race.

    And so he did, and won it too,
      For he got first to town;
    Nor stopped till where he had got up,
      He did again get down.

    Now let us sing, Long live the King,
      And Gilpin, long live he;
    And when he next doth ride abroad,
      May I be there to see.

    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    How I wonder what you are!
    Up above the world so high.
    Like a diamond in the sky.

    When the blazing sun is gone,
    When he nothing shines upon,
    Then you show your little light,
    Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

    Then the traveller in the dark
    Thanks you for your tiny spark:
    How could he see where to go,
    If you did not twinkle so?

    In the dark blue sky you keep,
    Often through my curtains peep,
    For you never shut your eye,
    Till the sun is in the sky.

    As your bright and tiny spark
    Lights the traveller in the dark,
    Though I know not what you are,
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
