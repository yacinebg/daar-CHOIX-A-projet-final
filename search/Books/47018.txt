PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.


The First Edition of this work had a rapid sale, and within a few weeks
after it was published the entire issue passed from the publisher’s
shelves into the hands of the public. A Second Edition, although
urgently called for, was not immediately attempted. The First had been
found incomplete and faulty in many respects, and the author determined
to thoroughly revise and recast before again going to press. The
present edition, therefore, will be found much more complete than the
First; indeed, I may say that it has been entirely rewritten, and that,
whereas the First contained but 3,000 words, this gives nearly 5,000,
with a mass of fresh illustrations, and extended articles on the more
important slang terms—HUMBUG, for instance. The notices of a _Lingua
Franca_ element in the language of London vagabonds is peculiar to this
edition.

My best thanks are due to several correspondents for valuable hints
and suggestions as to the probable etymologies of various colloquial
expressions.

One literary journal of high repute recommended a division of
cant from slang; but the annoyance of two indices in a small work
appeared to me to more than counterbalance the benefit of a stricter
philological classification, so I have for the present adhered to the
old arrangement; indeed, to separate cant from slang would be almost
impossible.

Respecting the HIEROGLYPHICS OF VAGABONDS, I have been unable to obtain
further information; but the following extract from a popular manual
which I have just met with is worth recording, although, perhaps,
somewhat out of place in a Preface.

  “Gipseys follow their brethren by numerous marks, such as strewing
  handfuls of grass in the day time at a four lane or cross roads;
  the grass being strewn down the road the gang have taken; also, by
  a cross being made on the ground with a stick or knife, the longest
  end of the cross denotes the route taken. In the night time a cleft
  stick is placed in the fence at the cross roads, with an arm pointing
  down the road their comrades have taken. The marks are always placed
  on the left-hand side, so that the stragglers can easily and readily
  find them.”—_Snowden’s Magistrate’s Assistant_, 1852, p. 444.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.


If any gentleman of a studious turn of mind, who may have acquired the
habit of carrying pencils and notebooks, would for one year reside in
Monmouth Court, Seven Dials; six months in Orchard Street, Westminster;
three months in Mint Street, Borough; and consent to undergo another
three months on the extremely popular, but very much disliked treadmill
(_vulgo_ the “Everlasting Staircase”), finishing, I will propose, by
a six months’ tramp, in the character of a cadger and beggar, over
England, I have not the least doubt but that he would be able to write
an interesting work on the languages, secret and vulgar, of the lower
orders.

In the matter of SLANG, our studious friend would have to divide his
time betwixt observation and research. Conversations on the outsides
of omnibuses, on steamboat piers, or at railway termini, would demand
his most attentive hearing, so would the knots of semi-decayed cabmen,
standing about in bundles of worn-out great-coats and haybands, betwixt
watering pails, and conversing in a dialect every third word of which
is without home or respectable relations. He would also have to station
himself for hours near gatherings of ragged boys playing or fighting,
but ever and anon contributing to the note-book a pure street term. He
would have to “hang about” lobbies, mark the refined word-droppings
of magniloquent flunkies, “run after” all the popular preachers, go
to the Inns of Court, be up all night and about all day—in fact, be a
ubiquitarian, with a note-book and pencil in hand.

As for research, he would have to turn over each page of our popular
literature, wander through all the weekly serials, wade through the
newspapers, fashionable and unfashionable, and subscribe to Mudie’s,
and scour the novels. This done, and if he has been an observant man,
I will engage to say, that he has made a choice gathering, and that we
may reasonably expect an interesting little book.

I give this outline of preparatory study to show the reason the task
has never been undertaken before. People in the present chase after
respectability don’t care to turn blackguards, and exchange cards with
the Whitechapel Pecker or the Sharp’s-alley Chicken, for the sake of
a few vulgar, although curious words; and we may rest assured that it
is quite impossible to write any account of vulgar or low language,
and remain seated on damask in one’s own drawing room. But a fortunate
circumstance attended the compiler of the present work, and he has
neither been required to reside in Seven Dials, visit the treadmill, or
wander over the country in the character of a vagabond or a cadger.

In collecting old ballads, penny histories, and other printed
street narratives, as materials for a _History of Cheap or Popular
Literature_, he frequently had occasion to purchase in Seven Dials and
the Borough a few old songs or dying speeches, from the chaunters and
patterers who abound in those neighbourhoods. With some of these men
(their names would not in the least interest the reader, and would only
serve the purpose of making this Preface look like a vulgar page from
the London Directory) an arrangement was made, that they should collect
the cant and slang words used by the different wandering tribes of
London and the country. Some of these chaunters are men of respectable
education (although filling a vagabond’s calling), and can write good
hands, and express themselves fluently, if not with orthographical
correctness. To prevent deception and mistakes, the words and phrases
sent in were checked off by other chaunters and tramps. Assistance
was also sought and obtained, through an intelligent printer in Seven
Dials, from the costermongers in London, and the pedlars and hucksters
who traverse the country. In this manner the greater number of cant
words were procured, very valuable help being continually derived from
_Mayhew’s London Labour and London Poor_, a work which had gone over
much of the same ground. The slang and vulgar expressions were gleaned
from every source which appeared to offer any materials; indeed the
references attached to words in the Dictionary frequently indicate the
channels which afforded them.

Although in the Introduction I have divided cant from slang, and
treated the subjects separately, yet in the Dictionary I have only, in
a few instances, pointed out which are slang, or which are cant terms.
The task would have been a difficult one. Many words which were once
cant are slang now. The words PRIG and COVE are instances in point.
Once cant and secret terms, they are now only street vulgarisms.

The etymologies attempted are only given as contributions to the
subject, and the derivation of no vulgar term is guaranteed. The
origin of many street words will, perhaps, never be discovered, having
commenced with a knot of illiterate persons, and spread amongst a
public that cared not a fig for the history of the word, so long as it
came to their tongues to give a vulgar piquancy to a joke, or relish to
an exceedingly familiar conversation. The references and authorities
given in italics frequently show only the direction or probable source
of the etymology. The author, to avoid tedious verbiage, was obliged,
in so small a work, to be curt in his notes and suggestions.

He has to explain also that a few words will, probably, be noticed in
the Slang and Cant Dictionary that are questionable as coming under
either of those designations. These have been admitted because they
were originally either vulgar terms, or the compiler had something
novel to say concerning them. The makers of our large dictionaries have
been exceedingly crotchety in their choice of what they considered
respectable words. It is amusing to know that Richardson used the word
HUMBUG to explain the sense of other words, but omitted it in the
alphabetical arrangement as not sufficiently respectable and ancient.
The word SLANG, too, he served in the same way.

Filthy and obscene words have been carefully excluded, although
street-talk, unlicensed and unwritten, abounds in these.

  “Immodest words admit of no defence,
  For want of decency is want of sense.”

It appears from the calculations of philologists, that there are 38,000
words in the English language, including derivations. I believe I have,
for the first time, in consecutive order, added at least 3,000 words
to the previous stock,—vulgar and often very objectionable, but still
terms in every-day use, and employed by thousands. It is not generally
known, that the polite Lord Chesterfield once desired Dr. Johnson to
compile a Slang Dictionary; indeed, it was Chesterfield, some say, who
first used the word HUMBUG. Words, like peculiar styles of dress, get
into public favour, and come and go in fashion. When great favourites
and universal they truly become household words, although generally
considered slang, when their origin or antecedents are inquired into.

A few errors of the press, I am sorry to say, may be noticed; but,
considering the novelty of the subject, and the fact that no fixed
orthography of vulgar speech exists, it will, I hope, be deemed a not
uninteresting essay on a new and very singular branch of human inquiry;
for, as Mayhew remarks, “the whole subject of cant and slang is, to the
philologist, replete with interest of the most profound character.”

THE COMPILER WILL BE MUCH OBLIGED BY THE RECEIPT, THROUGH MR. CAMDEN
HOTTEN, THE PUBLISHER, OF ANY CANT, SLANG, OR VULGAR WORDS NOT
MENTIONED IN THE DICTIONARY. THE PROBABLE ORIGIN, OR ETYMOLOGY, OF ANY
FASHIONABLE OR UNFASHIONABLE VULGARISM, WILL ALSO BE RECEIVED BY HIM
WITH THANKS.

THE HISTORY OF CANT,

OR, THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF VAGABONDS.


CANT and SLANG are universal and world-wide.

Nearly every nation on the face of the globe, polite and barbarous,
may be divided into two portions, the stationary and the wandering,
the civilised and the uncivilised, the respectable and the
scoundrel,—those who have fixed abodes and avail themselves of the
refinements of civilisation, and those who go from place to place
picking up a precarious livelihood by petty sales, begging, or theft.
This peculiarity is to be observed amongst the heathen tribes of the
southern hemisphere, as well as the oldest and most refined countries
of Europe. As Mayhew very pertinently remarks, “it would appear, that
not only are all races divisible into wanderers and settlers, but
that each civilised or settled tribe has generally some wandering
horde intermingled with, and in a measure preying upon it.” In South
Africa, the naked and miserable Hottentots are pestered by the still
more abject _Sonquas_; and it may be some satisfaction for us to know
that our old enemies at the Cape, the Kafirs, are troubled with a
tribe of rascals called _Fingoes_,—the former term, we are informed
by travellers, signifying beggars, and the latter wanderers and
outcasts. In South America, and among the islands of the Pacific,
matters are pretty much the same. Sleek and fat rascals, with not
much inclination towards honesty, fatten, or rather fasten, like body
insects, upon other rascals, who would be equally sleek and fat but for
their vagabond dependents. Luckily for respectable persons, however,
vagabonds, both at home and abroad, show certain outward peculiarities
which distinguish them from the great mass of lawful people off whom
they feed and fatten. Personal observation, and a little research into
books, enable me to mark these external traits. The wandering races
are remarkable for the development of the bones of the face, as the
jaws, cheek-bones, &c., high crowned, stubborn-shaped heads, quick
restless eyes,[1] and hands nervously itching to be doing;[2] for their
love of gambling,—staking their very existence upon a single cast; for
sensuality of all kinds; _and for their use of a CANT language with
which to conceal their designs and plunderings_.

The secret jargon, or rude speech, of the vagabonds who hang upon the
Hottentots is termed _cuze-cat_. In Finland, the fellows who steal
seal skins, pick the pockets of bear-skin overcoats, and talk Cant,
are termed Lappes. In France, the secret language of highwaymen,
housebreakers, and pickpockets is named _Argot_. The brigands and more
romantic rascals of Spain, term their private tongue _Germania_, or
Robbers’ Language. _Rothwalsch_, or Red Italian, is synonymous with
Cant and thieves’ talk in Germany. The vulgar dialect of Malta, and the
Scala towns of the Levant—imported into this country and incorporated
with English cant—is known as the _Lingua Franca_, or bastard Italian.
And the crowds of lazy beggars that infest the streets of Naples
and Rome, and the brigands that Albert Smith used to describe near
Pompeii—stopping a railway train, and deliberately rifling the pockets
and baggage of the passengers—their secret language is termed _Gergo_.
In England, as we all know, it is called _Cant_—often improperly
_Slang_.

Most nations, then, may boast, or rather lament, a vulgar tongue,
formed principally from the national language, the hereditary property
of thieves, tramps, and beggars,—the pests of civilised communities.
The formation of these secret tongues vary, of course, with the
circumstances surrounding the speakers. A writer in _Notes and
Queries_,[3] has well remarked, that “the investigation of the origin
and principles of Cant and Slang language opens a curious field of
enquiry, replete with considerable interest to the philologist and the
philosopher. It affords a remarkable instance of lingual contrivance,
which, without the introduction of much arbitrary matter, has developed
a system of communicating ideas, having all the advantages of a foreign
language.”

An inquiry into the etymology of foreign vulgar secret tongues, and
their analogy with that spoken in England, would be curious and
interesting in the extreme, but neither present space nor personal
acquirements permit of the task, and therefore the writer confines
himself to a short account of the origin of English Cant.

The terms CANT and CANTING were doubtless derived from _chaunt_ or
_chaunting_,—the “whining tone, or modulation of voice adopted by
beggars, with intent to coax, wheedle, or cajole by pretensions of
wretchedness.”[4] For the origin of the other application of the word
CANT, pulpit hypocrisy, we are indebted to a pleasant page in the
Spectator (No. 147):—“_Cant_ is by some people derived from one Andrew
Cant, who, they say, was a Presbyterian minister in some illiterate
part of Scotland, who by exercise and use had obtained the faculty,
alias gift, of talking in the pulpit in such a dialect that ’tis
said he was understood by none but his own congregation,—and not by
all of them. Since Master _Cant’s_ time it has been understood in a
larger sense, and signifies all exclamations, whinings, unusual tones,
and, in fine, all praying and preaching like the unlearned of the
Presbyterians.” This anecdote is curious, if it is not correct. It was
the custom in Addison’s time to have a fling at the blue Presbyterians,
and the mention made by _Whitelocke_ of Andrew Cant, a fanatical Scotch
preacher, and the squib upon the same worthy, in _Scotch Presbyterian
Eloquence Displayed_, may probably have started the whimsical
etymology. As far as we are concerned, however, in the present inquiry,
CANT was derived from _chaunt_, a beggar’s whine; CHAUNTING being the
recognised term amongst beggars to this day for begging orations and
street whinings; and CHAUNTER, a street talker and tramp, the very
term still used by strollers and patterers. The use of the word CANT,
amongst beggars, must certainly have commenced at a very early date,
for we find “TO CANTE, to speake,” in Harman’s list of Rogues’ Words
in the year 1566; and Harrison about the same time,[5] in speaking
of beggars and Gipseys, says, “they have devised a language among
themselves which they name CANTING, but others Pedlars’ Frenche.”

Now the word CANT in its old sense, and SLANG[6] in its modern
application, although used by good writers and persons of education
as synonymes, are in reality quite distinct and separate terms. CANT,
apart from religious hypocrisy, refers to the old secret language, by
allegory or distinct terms, of Gipseys, thieves, tramps, and beggars.
SLANG represents that evanescent, vulgar language, ever changing with
fashion and taste, which has principally come into vogue during the
last seventy or eighty years, spoken by persons in every grade of life,
rich and poor, honest and dishonest.[7] CANT is old; SLANG is always
modern and changing. To illustrate the difference: a thief in _Cant_
language would term a horse a PRANCER or a PRAD,—while in _slang_, a
man of fashion would speak of it as a BIT OF BLOOD, or a SPANKER, or
a NEAT TIT. A handkerchief, too, would be a BILLY, a FOGLE, or a KENT
RAG, in the secret language of low characters,—whilst amongst vulgar
persons, or those who aped their speech, it would be called a RAG,
a WIPE, or a CLOUT. CANT was formed for purposes of secrecy. SLANG
is indulged in from a desire to appear familiar with life, gaiety,
town-humour, and with the transient nick names and street jokes of the
day. Both Cant and Slang, I am aware, are often huddled together as
synonymes, but they are distinct terms, and as such should be used.

To the Gipseys, beggars and thieves are undoubtedly indebted for
their Cant language. The Gipseys landed in this country early in the
reign of Henry the Eighth. They were at first treated as conjurors
and magicians,—indeed they were hailed by the populace with as much
applause as a company of English theatricals usually receive on
arriving in a distant colony. They came here with all their old Eastern
arts of palmistry, fortune-telling, doubling money by incantation and
burial,—shreds of pagan idolatry; and they brought with them, also,
the dishonesty of the lower caste of Asiatics, and the vagabondism
they had acquired since leaving their ancient dwelling places in the
East, many centuries before. They possessed, also, a _language_ quite
distinct from anything that had been heard in England, and they claimed
the title of Egyptians, and as such, when their thievish wandering
propensities became a public nuisance, were cautioned and proscribed in
a royal proclamation by Henry VIII.[8] The Gipseys were not long in the
country before they found native imitators. Vagabondism is peculiarly
catching. The idle, the vagrant, and the criminal outcasts of society,
caught an idea from the so called Egyptians—soon corrupted to Gipseys.
They learned from them how to tramp, sleep under hedges and trees, to
tell fortunes, and find stolen property for a consideration—frequently,
as the saying runs, before it was lost. They also learned the value
and application of a _secret tongue_, indeed all the accompaniments of
maunding and imposture, except thieving and begging, which were well
known in this country long before the Gipseys paid it a visit,—perhaps
the only negative good that can be said in their favour.

_Harman_, in the year 1566, wrote a singular, not to say droll
book, entitled, _A Caveat for commen Cvrsetors, vulgarley called
Vagabones, newly augmented and inlarged_, wherein the history and
various descriptions of rogues and vagabonds are given, together with
their canting tongue. This book, the earliest of the kind, gives the
singular fact that within a dozen years after the landing of the
Gipseys, companies of English vagrants were formed, places of meeting
appointed, districts for plunder and begging operations marked out,
and rules agreed to for their common management. In some cases Gipseys
joined the English gangs, in others English vagrants joined the
Gipseys. The fellowship was found convenient and profitable, as both
parties were aliens to the laws and customs of the country, living in
a great measure in the open air, apart from the lawful public, and
often meeting each other on the same bye-path, or in the same retired
valley;—but seldom intermarrying, and entirely adopting each other’s
habits. The common people, too, soon began to consider them as of one
family,—all rogues, and from Egypt. The secret language spoken by the
Gipseys, principally Hindoo and extremely barbarous to English ears,
was found incomprehensible and very difficult to learn. The Gipseys,
also, found the same difficulty with the English language. A rude,
rough, and most singular compromise was made, and a mixture of Gipsey,
Old English, newly-coined words, and cribbings from any foreign, and
therefore secret language, mixed and jumbled together, formed what has
ever since been known as the CANTING LANGUAGE, or PEDLER’S FRENCH; or,
during the past century, ST. GILES’ GREEK.

Such was the origin of CANT; and in illustration of its blending
with the Gipsey or Cingari tongue, dusky and Oriental from the sunny
plains of Central Asia, I am enabled to give the accompanying list of

Here then we have the remarkable fact of several words of pure Gipsey
and Asiatic origin going the round of Europe, passing into this
country before the Reformation, and coming down to us through numerous
generations purely in the mouths of the people. They have seldom been
written or used in books, and simply as vulgarisms have they reached
our time. Only a few are now cant, and some are household words. The
word JOCKEY, as applied to a dealer or rider of horses, came from the
Gipsey, and means in that language a whip. Our standard dictionaries
give, of course, none but conjectural etymologies. Another word,
BAMBOOZLE, has been a sore difficulty with lexicographers. It is not in
the old dictionaries, although extensively used in familiar or popular
language for the last two centuries; in fact, the very word that Swift,
Butler, L’Estrange, and Arbuthnot would pick out at once as a telling
and most serviceable term. It is, as we have seen, from the Gipsey;
and here I must state that it was Boucher who first drew attention to
the fact, although in his remarks on the dusky tongue, he has made a
ridiculous mistake by concluding it to be identical with its offspring,
CANT. Other parallel instances, with but slight variations from the old
Gipsey meanings, could be mentioned, but sufficient examples have been
adduced to show that Marsden, the great Oriental scholar in the last
century, when he declared before the Society of Antiquaries that the
Cant of English thieves and beggars had nothing to do with the language
spoken by the despised Gipseys, was in error. Had the Gipsey tongue
been analysed and committed to writing three centuries ago, there is
every probability that many scores of words now in common use could be
at once traced to its source. Instances continually occur now-a-days
of street vulgarisms ascending to the drawing-rooms of respectable
society. Why, then, may not the Gipsey-vagabond alliance three
centuries ago have contributed its quota of common words to popular
speech?

I feel confident there is a Gipsey element in the English language
hitherto unrecognised; slender it may be, but not, therefore,
unimportant.

“Indeed,” says Moore the poet, in a humorous little book, _Tom Crib’s
Memorial to Congress_, 1819, “the Gipsey language, with the exception
of such terms as relate to their own peculiar customs, differs
but little from the regular Flash or Cant language.” But this was
magnifying the importance of the alliance. Moore knew nothing of the
Gipsey tongue other than the few Cant words put into the mouths of the
beggars, in _Beaumont and Fletcher’s Comedy of the Beggar’s Bush_,
and _Ben Jonson’s Masque of the Gipseys Metamorphosed_,—hence his
confounding Cant with Gipsey speech, and appealing to the Glossary of
Cant for so called “Gipsey” words at the end of the _Life of Bamfylde
Moore Carew_, to bear him out in his assertion. Still his remark bears
much truth, and proof would have been found long ago if any scholar had
taken the trouble to examine the “barbarous jargon of Cant,” and to
have compared it with Gipsey speech. As George Borrow, in his _Account
of the Gipseys in Spain_, eloquently concludes his second volume,
speaking of the connection of the Gipseys with Europeans:—“Yet from
this temporary association were produced two results: European fraud
became sharpened by coming into contact with Asiatic craft; whilst
European tongues, by imperceptible degrees, became recruited with
various words (some of them wonderfully expressive), many of which have
long been stumbling-blocks to the philologist, who, whilst stigmatising
them as words of mere vulgar invention, or of unknown origin, has been
far from dreaming that a little more research or reflection would have
proved their affinity to the Sclavonic, Persian, or Romaic, or perhaps
to the mysterious object of his veneration, the Sanscrit, the sacred
tongue of the palm-covered regions of Ind; words originally introduced
into Europe by objects too miserable to occupy for a moment his
lettered attention,—the despised denizens of the tents of Roma.”

But the Gipseys, their speech, their character—bad enough as all the
world testifies—their history and their religious belief, have been
totally disregarded, and their poor persons buffeted and jostled about
until it is a wonder that any trace of origin or national speech exists
in them. On the continent they received better attention at the hands
of learned men. Their language was taken down, their history traced,
and their extraordinary customs and practice of living in the open
air, and eating raw or putrid meat, explained. They ate reptiles and
told fortunes, because they had learnt it through their forefathers
centuries back in Hindostan, and they devoured carrion because the
Hindoo proverb—“_that which God kills is better than that killed by
man_,”[11]—was still in their remembrance. Grellman, a learned German,
was their principal historian, and to him we are almost entirely
indebted for the little we know of their language.[12]

GIPSEY then started, and partially merged into CANT, and the old story
told by Harrison and others, that the first inventor of canting was
hanged for his pains, would seem to be a fable, for jargon as it is,
it was, doubtless, of gradual formation, like all other languages or
systems of speech. The Gipseys at the present day all know the _old
cant_ words, as well as their own tongue,—or rather what remains of it.
As Borrow states, “the dialect of the English Gipseys is mixed with
English words.”[13] Those of the tribe who frequent fairs, and mix
with English tramps, readily learn the new words, as they are adopted
by what Harman calls, “the fraternity of vagabonds.” Indeed, the old
CANT is a common language to vagrants of all descriptions and origin
scattered over the British Isles.

Ancient English CANT has considerably altered since the first
dictionary was compiled by Harman, in 1566. A great many words are
unknown in the present tramps’ and thieves’ vernacular. Some of them,
however, bear still their old definitions, while others have adopted
fresh meanings,—to escape detection, I suppose. “ABRAHAM MAN” is yet
seen in our modern SHAM ABRAHAM, or PLAY THE OLD SOLDIER, _i.e._,
to feign sickness or distress. “AUTUM” is still a church or chapel
amongst Gipseys; and “BECK,” a constable, is our modern cant and slang
BEEK, a policeman or magistrate. “BENE,” or BONE, stands for _good_
in Seven Dials, and the back streets of Westminster; and “BOWSE” is
our modern BOOZE, to drink or fuddle. A “BOWSING KEN” was the old cant
term for a public house, and BOOZING KEN, in modern cant, has precisely
the same meaning. “BUFE” was then the term for a dog, now it is
BUFFER,—frequently applied to men. “CASSAN” is both old and modern cant
for cheese; the same may be said of “CHATTES” or CHATTS, the gallows.
“COFE,” or COVE, is still the vulgar synonyme for a man. “DRAWERS”
was hose, or “hosen,”—now applied to the lining for trousers. “DUDES”
was cant for clothes, we now say DUDDS. “FLAG” is still a fourpenny
piece; and “FYLCHE” means to rob. “KEN” is a house, and “LICK” means
to thrash; “PRANCER” is yet known amongst rogues as a horse; and “to
PRIG,” amongst high and low, is to steal. Three centuries ago, if
one beggar said anything disagreeable to another, the person annoyed
would say “STOW YOU,” or hold your peace; low people now say STOW IT,
equivalent to “be quiet.” “TRINE” is still to hang; “WYN” yet stands
for a penny. And many other words, as will be seen in the glossary,
still retain their ancient meaning.

As specimens of those words which have altered their original cant
signification, I may instance “CHETE,” now written CHEAT. CHETE was
in ancient cant what _chop_ is in the Canton-Chinese,—an almost
inseparable adjunct. Everything was termed a CHETE, and qualified by
a substantive-adjective, which showed what kind of a CHETE was meant;
for instance, “CRASHING CHETES” were teeth; a “MOFFLING CHETE,” a
napkin; a “GRUNTING CHETE,” a pig, &c. &c. CHEAT now-a-days means
to defraud or swindle, and lexicographers have tortured etymology
for an original—but without success. _Escheats_ and _escheatours_
have been named, but with great doubts; indeed, Stevens, the learned
commentator on Shakespere, acknowledged that he “did not recollect to
have met with the word _cheat_ in our ancient writers.”[14] CHEAT, to
defraud, then, is no other than an old Cant term, somewhat altered
in its meaning,[15] and as such it should be described in the next
Etymological Dictionary. Another instance of a change in the meaning of
the old Cant, but the retention of the word is seen in “CLY,” formerly
to take or steal, now a pocket;—remembering a certain class of low
characters, a curious connection between the two meanings will be
discovered. “MAKE” was a halfpenny, we now say MAG,—MAKE being modern
Cant for appropriating,—“convey the wise it call.” “MILLING” stood for
stealing, it is now a pugilistic term for fighting or beating. “NAB”
was a head,—low people now say NOB, the former meaning, in modern
Cant, to steal or seize. “PEK” was meat,—we still say PECKISH, when
hungry. “PRYGGES, _dronken Tinkers or beastly people_,” as old Harman
wrote, would scarcely be understood now; a PRIG, in the 19th century,
is a pickpocket or thief. “QUIER,” or QUEER, like _cheat_, was a very
common prefix, and meant bad or wicked,—it now means odd, curious, or
strange; but to the ancient cant we are indebted for the word, which
etymologists should remember.[16] “ROME,” or RUM, formerly meant good,
or of the first quality, and was extensively used like _cheat_ and
_queer_,—indeed as an adjective it was the opposite of the latter. RUM
now means curious, and is synonymous with queer, thus,—a “RUMMY old
fellow,” or a “QUEER old man.” Here again we see the origin of an every
day word, scouted by lexicographers and snubbed by respectable persons,
but still a word of frequent and popular use. “YANNAM” meant bread,
PANNUM is the word now. Other instances could be pointed out, but they
will be observed in the dictionary.

Several words are entirely obsolete. “ALYBBEG” no longer means a bed,
nor “ASKEW” a cup. “BOOGET,”[17] now-a-days, would not be understood
for a basket; neither would “GAN” pass current for mouth. “FULLAMS”
was the old cant term for false or loaded dice, and although used
by Shakespere in this sense, is now unknown and obsolete. Indeed,
as Tom Moore somewhere remarks, the present Greeks of St. Giles,
themselves, would be thoroughly puzzled by many of the ancient canting
songs,—taking for example, the first verse of an old favourite:

  Bing out, bien Morts, and toure and toure,
    Bing out, bien Morts, and toure;
  For all your duds are bing’d awast;
    The bien cove hath the loure.[18]

But I think I cannot do better than present to the reader at once an
entire copy of the first Canting Dictionary ever compiled. As before
mentioned, it was the work of one Thos. Harman, a gentleman who lived
in the days of Queen Elizabeth. Some writers have remarked that
Decker[19] was the first to compile a Dictionary of the vagabonds’
tongue; whilst Borrow,[20] and Moore, the poet, stated that Richard
Head performed that service in his _Life of an English Rogue_,
published in the year 1680. All these statements are equally incorrect,
for the first attempt was made more than a century before the latter
work was issued. The quaint spelling and old-fashioned phraseology are
preserved, and the reader will quickly detect many vulgar street words,
old acquaintances, dressed in antique garb.[21]

  initiated, first-class rogue, “mete any beggar, whether he be sturdy
  or impotent, he will demand of him whether ever he was ‘_stalled to
  the roge_’ or no. If he say he was, he will know of whom, and his
  name yt stalled him. And if he be not learnedly able to show him the
  whole circumstance thereof, he will spoyle him of his money, either
  of his best garment, if it be worth any money, and haue him to the
  bowsing ken: which is, to some typpling house next adjoyninge, and
  layth there to gage the best thing that he hath for twenty pence or
  two shillings: this man obeyeth for feare of beatinge. Then dooth
  this upright man call for a gage of bowse, which is a quarte potte of
  drink, and powres the same vpon his peld pate, adding these words,—I,
  _G. P._ do stalle the, _W. T._ to the Roge, and that from henceforth
  it shall be lawfull for thee to cant, that is to aske or begge for

Turning our attention more to the Cant of modern times, in connection
with the old, we find that words have been drawn into the thieves’
vocabulary from every conceivable source. Hard or infrequent words,
vulgarly termed _crack-jaw_, or _jaw-breakers_, were very often used
and considered as cant terms. And here it should be mentioned that
at the present day the most inconsistent and far-fetched terms are
often used for secret purposes, when they are known to be caviare
to the million. It is really laughable to know that such words as
_incongruous_, _insipid_, _interloper_, _intriguing_, _indecorum_,
_forestal_, _equip_, _hush_, _grapple_, &c. &c., were current Cant
words a century and a half ago; but such was the case, as any one may
see in the _Dictionary of Canting Words_, at the end of _Bacchus and
Venus_,[22] 1737. They are inserted not as jokes or squibs, but as
selections from the veritable pocket dictionaries of the Jack Sheppards
and Dick Turpins of the day. If they were safely used as unknown and
cabalistic terms amongst the commonalty, the fact would form a very
curious illustration of the ignorance of our poor ancestors. One
piece of information is conveyed to us, _i.e._, that the “Knights” or
“Gentlemen of the road,” using these polite words in those days of
highwaymen, were really well educated men,—which heretofore has always
been a hard point of belief, notwithstanding old novels and operas.

Amongst those Cant words which have either altered their meaning, or
have become extinct, I may cite LADY, formerly the Cant for “a very
crooked, deformed, and ill-shapen woman;”[23] and HARMAN, “a pair of
stocks, or a constable.” The former is a pleasant piece of satire,
whilst the latter indicates a singular method of revenge. HARMAN was
the first author who specially wrote against English vagabonds, and for
his trouble his name became synonymous with a pair of stocks, and a
policeman of the olden time.

Apart from the Gipsey element, we find that Cant abounds in terms from
foreign languages, and that it exhibits the growth of most recognised
and completely formed tongues,—the gathering of words from foreign
sources. In the reign of Elizabeth and of King James I., several
Dutch, Spanish, and Flemish words were introduced by soldiers who had
served in the Low Countries, and sailors who had returned from the
Spanish Main, who like “mine ancient Pistol” were fond of garnishing
their speech with outlandish phrases. Many of these were soon picked
up and adopted by vagabonds and tramps in their Cant language. The
Anglo-Norman and the Anglo-Saxon, the Scotch, the French, the Italian,
and even the classic languages of ancient Italy and Greece, have
contributed to its list of words,—besides the various provincial
dialects of England. Indeed, as Mayhew remarks, English Cant seems
to be formed on the same basis as the _Argot_ of the French, and the
_Roth-Spræc_ of the Germans,—partly metaphorical, and partly by the
introduction of such corrupted foreign terms as are likely to be
unknown to the society amid which the Cant speakers exist. ARGOT is the
London thieves’ word for their secret language,—it is, of course, from
the French, but that matters not so long as it is incomprehensible to
the police and the mob. BOOZE, or BOUSE, I am reminded by a friendly
correspondent, comes from the Dutch, BUYSEN. DOMINE, a parson, is
from the Latin; and DON, a clever fellow, has been filched from the
Spanish. DONNA AND FEELES, a woman and children, is from the Lingua
Franca, or bastard Italian, although it sounds like an odd mixture of
Spanish and French; whilst DUDDS, the vulgar term for clothes, may have
been pilfered either from the Gaelic or the Dutch. FEELE, a daughter,
from the French; and FROW, a girl or wife, from the German—are common
tramps’ terms. So are GENT, silver, from the French, _Argent_; and
VIAL, a country town, also from the French. HORRID-HORN, a fool, is
believed to be from the Erse; and GLOAK, a man, from the Scotch. As
stated before, the Dictionary will supply numerous other instances.

There is one source, however, of secret street terms, which, in
the first edition of this work, was entirely overlooked,—indeed,
it was unknown to the editor until pointed out by a friendly
correspondent,—the _Lingua Franca_, or bastard Italian, spoken at
Genoa, Trieste, Malta, Constantinople, Smyrna, Alexandria, and all
Mediterranean seaport towns. The ingredients of this imported Cant
are many. Its foundation is Italian, with a mixture of modern Greek,
German (from the Austrian ports), Spanish, Turkish, and French. It has
been introduced to the notice of the London wandering tribes by the
sailors, foreign and English, who trade to and from the Mediterranean
seaports, by the swarms of organ players from all parts of Italy, and
by the makers of images from Rome and Florence,—all of whom, in dense
thoroughfares, mingle with our lower orders. It would occupy too much
space here to give a list of these words. They are all noted in the
Dictionary.

“There are several Hebrew terms in our Cant language, obtained, it
would appear, from the intercourse of the thieves with the Jew _fences_
(receivers of stolen goods); many of the Cant terms, again, are
Sanscrit, got from the Gipseys; many Latin, got by the beggars from
the Catholic prayers before the Reformation; and many, again, Italian,
got from the wandering musicians and others; indeed the showmen have
but lately introduced a number of Italian phrases into their Cant
language.”[24] The Hindostanèe also contributes several words, and
these have been introduced by the Lascar sailors, who come over here
in the East Indiamen, and lodge during their stay in the low tramps’
lodging houses at the East end of London. Speaking of the learned
tongues, I may mention that, precarious and abandoned as the vagabond’s
existence is, many persons of classical or refined education have from
time to time joined the ranks,—occasionally from inclination, as in
the popular instance of Bamfylde Moore Carew, but generally through
indiscretion, and loss of character.[25] This will in some measure
account for numerous classical and learned words figuring as Cant terms
in the vulgar Dictionary.

In the early part of the last century, when highwaymen were by all
accounts so plentiful, a great many new words were added to the canting
vocabulary, whilst several old terms fell into disuse. CANT, for
instance, as applied to thieves’ talk, was supplanted by the word FLASH.

A singular feature, however, in vulgar language, is the retention
and the revival of sterling old English words, long since laid up
in ancient manuscripts, or the subject of dispute among learned
antiquaries. Disraeli somewhere says, “the purest source of _neology_
is in the revival of _old words_”—

  “Words that wise Bacon or brave Rawleigh spake,”

and Dr. Latham honours our subject by remarking that “the thieves of
London are the conservators of Anglo-Saxonisms.” Mayhew, too, in his
interesting work, _London Labour and London Poor_, admits that many
Cant and Slang phrases are merely old English terms, which have
become obsolete through the caprices of fashion. And the reader who
looks into the Dictionary of the vagabonds’ lingo, will see at a
glance that these gentlemen were quite correct, and that we are
compelled to acknowledge the singular truth that a great many old
words, once respectable, and in the mouths of kings and fine ladies,
are now only so many signals for shrugs and shudders amongst
exceedingly polite people. A Belgravian gentleman who had lost his
watch or his pocket-handkerchief, would scarcely remark to his mamma
that it had been BONED—yet BONE, in old times, meant to steal
amongst high and low. And a young lady living in the precincts of
dingy, but aristocratic May-Fair, although enraptured with a Jenny
Lind or a Ristori, would hardly think of turning back in the box to
inform papa that she, Ristori or Lind, “made no BONES of it”—yet the
phrase was most respectable and well-to-do, before it met with a
change of circumstances. “A CRACK article,” however first-rate,
would, as far as speech is concerned, have greatly displeased Dr.
Johnson and Mr. Walker—yet both CRACK, in the sense of excellent,
and CRACK UP, to boast or praise, were not considered vulgarisms in
the time of Henry VIII. DODGE, a cunning trick, is from the
Anglo-Saxon; and ancient nobles used to “get each other’s DANDER UP”
before appealing to their swords,—quite FLABERGASTING (also a
respectable old word) the half score of lookers-on with the thumps
and cuts of their heavy weapons. GALLAVANTING, waiting upon the
ladies, was as polite in expression as in action; whilst a clergyman
at Paule’s Crosse, thought nothing of bidding a noisy hearer to
“hold his GAB,” or “shut up his GOB.” GADDING, roaming about in an
idle and trapesing manner, was used in an old translation of the
Bible; and “to do anything GINGERLY” was to do it with great care.
Persons of modern tastes will be shocked to know that the great Lord
Bacon spoke of the lower part of a man’s face as his GILLS.

Shakespere, or as the French say, “the divine William,” also used many
words which are now counted as dreadfully vulgar. “CLEAN gone,” in the
sense of out of sight, or entirely away; “you took me all A-MORT,” or
confounded me; “it won’t FADGE,” or suit, are phrases taken at random
from the great dramatist’s works. A London costermonger, or inhabitant
of the streets, instead of saying “I’ll make him yield,” or “give
in,” in a fight or contest, would say, “I’ll make him BUCKLE under.”
Shakespere, in his _Henry the Fourth_ (Part 2, Act i., Scene 1) has the
word, and Mr. Halliwell, one of the greatest and most industrious of
living antiquaries, informs us, that “the commentators do not supply
another example.” How strange, then, that the Bard of Avon, and the
Cockney costermongers, should be joint partners and sole proprietors
of the vulgarism. If Shakespere was not a pugilist, he certainly
anticipated the terms of the prize ring—or they were respectable words
before the prize ring was thought of—for he has PAY, to beat or thrash,
and PEPPER, with a similar meaning; also FANCY, in the sense of pets
and favourites,—pugilists are often termed _the_ FANCY. The cant word
PRIG, from the Saxon, _priccan_, to filch, is also Shakesperian; so
indeed is PIECE, a contemptuous term for a young woman. Shakespere was
not the only vulgar dramatist of his time. Ben Jonson, Beaumont and
Fletcher, Brome, and other play-writers, occasionally put cant words
into the mouths of their low characters, or employed old words which
have since degenerated into vulgarisms. CRUSTY, poor tempered; “two of
a KIDNEY,” two of a sort; LARK, a piece of fun; LUG, to pull; BUNG, to
give or pass; PICKLE, a sad plight; FRUMP, to mock, are a few specimens
casually picked from the works of the old histrionic writers.

One old English mode of canting, simple and effective when familiarised
by practice, was the inserting a consonant betwixt each syllable; thus,
taking _g_, “How do you do?” would be “Hou_g_ do_g_ you_g_ do_g_?” The
name very properly given to this disagreeable nonsense, we are informed
by Grose, was _Gibberish_.

Another Cant has recently been attempted by transposing the initial
letters of words, so that a mutton chop becomes a _c_utton _m_op, a
pint of stout a _s_tint of _p_out; but it is satisfactory to know that
it has gained no ground. This is called _Marrowskying_, or _Medical
Greek_, from its use by medical students at the hospitals. Albert Smith
terms it the _Gower-street Dialect_.

The _Language of Ziph_, I may add, is another rude mode of disguising
English, in use among the students at Winchester College.




ACCOUNT OF THE HIEROGLYPHICS USED BY VAGABONDS.


One of the most singular chapters in a _History of Vagabondism_ would
certainly be an account of the Hieroglyphic signs used by tramps and
thieves. The reader may be startled to know that, in addition to a
secret language, the wandering tribes of this country have private
marks and symbolic signs with which to score their successes, failures,
and advice to succeeding beggars; in fact, that the country is
really dotted over with beggars’ finger posts and guide stones. The
assertion, however strange it may appear, is no fiction. The subject
was not long since brought under the attention of the Government by
Mr. Rawlinson.[26] “There is,” he says in his report, “a sort of
blackguards’ literature, and the initiated understand each other by
slang [cant] terms, by pantomimic signs, _and by_ HIEROGLYPHICS. _The
vagrant’s mark may be seen in Havant, on corners of streets, on door
posts, and on house steps. Simple as these chalk lines appear, they
inform the succeeding vagrants of all they require to know; and a few
white scratches may say, ‘be importunate,’ or ‘pass on.’_”

Another very curious account was taken from a provincial newspaper,
published in 1849, and forwarded to _Notes and Queries_,[27] under
the head of MENDICANT FREEMASONRY. “Persons,” remarks the writer,
“indiscreet enough to open their purses to the relief of the beggar
tribe, would do well to take a readily learned lesson as to the
folly of that misguided benevolence which encourages and perpetuates
vagabondism. Every door or passage is pregnant with instruction as
to the error committed by the patron of beggars, as the beggar-marks
show that a system of freemasonry is followed, by which a beggar knows
whether it will be worth his while to call into a passage or knock
at a door. Let any one examine the entrances to the passages in any
town, and there he will find chalk marks, unintelligible to him, but
significant enough to beggars. If a thousand towns are examined, the
same marks will be found at every passage entrance. The passage mark
is a cypher with a twisted tail: in some cases the tail projects into
the passage, in others outwardly; thus seeming to indicate whether the
houses down the passage are worth calling at or not. Almost every door
has its marks: these are varied. In some cases there is a cross on the
brick work, in others a cypher: the figures 1, 2, 3, are also used.
Every person may for himself test the accuracy of these statements
by the examination of the brick work near his own doorway—thus
demonstrating that mendicity is a regular trade, carried out upon a
system calculated to save time, and realise the largest profits.” These
remarks refer mainly to provincial towns, London being looked upon as
the tramps’ home, and therefore too FLY, or experienced, to be duped by
such means.

The only other notice of the hieroglyphics of vagabonds that I have
met with, is in _Mayhew’s London Labour and London Poor_.[28] Mayhew
obtained his information from two tramps, who stated that hawkers
employ these signs as well as beggars. One tramp thus described
the method of WORKING[29] a small town. “Two hawkers (PALS[29]) go
together, but separate when they enter a village, one taking one side
of the road, and selling different things; and so as to inform each
other as to the character of the people at whose houses they call,
_they chalk certain marks on their door posts_.” Another informant
stated that “if a PATTERER[29] has been CRABBED (that is, offended) at
any of the CRIBS (houses), _he mostly chalks a signal at or near the
door_.”

Another use is also made of these hieroglyphics. Charts of successful
begging neighbourhoods are rudely drawn, and symbolical signs attached
to each house to show whether benevolent or adverse.[30] “In many cases
there is over the kitchen mantel-piece” of a tramps’ lodging-house “_a
map of the district_, dotted here and there with memorandums of failure
or success.”[31] A correct facsimile of one of these singular maps has
been placed as a frontispiece. It was obtained from the patterers and
tramps who supplied a great many words for this work, and who have
been employed by me for some time in collecting Old Ballads, Christmas
Carols, Dying Speeches, and Last Lamentations, as materials for a
_History of Popular Literature_. The reader will no doubt be amused
with the drawing. The locality depicted is near Maidstone, in Kent, and
I am informed that it was probably sketched by a wandering SCREEVER[32]
in payment for a night’s lodging. The English practice of marking
everything, and scratching names on public property, extends itself to
the tribe of vagabonds. On the map, as may be seen in the left hand
corner, some TRAVELLER[32] has drawn a favourite or noted female,
singularly nick-named _Three-quarter Sarah_. What were the peculiar
accomplishments of this lady to demand so uncommon a name, the reader
will be at a loss to discover, but a patterer says it probably refers
to a shuffling dance of that name, common in tramps’ lodging-houses,
and in which “¾ Sarah” may have been a proficient. Above her, three
beggars or hawkers have reckoned their day’s earnings, amounting to
13s.; and on the right a tolerably correct sketch of a low hawker,
or costermonger, is drawn. “To Dover, the _nigh_ way,” is the exact
phraseology; and “hup here,” a fair specimen of the self-acquired
education of the tribe of cadgers. No key or explanation to the
hieroglyphics was given in the original, because it would have been
superfluous, when every inmate of the lodging-house knew the marks from
their cradle—or rather their mother’s back.

Should there be no map, “in most lodging-houses there is an old man who
is guide to every ‘WALK’ in the vicinity, and who can tell each house
on every round, that is ‘good for a cold tatur.’”[33] The hieroglyphics
that are used are:—

  ☓ NO GOOD; too poor, and know too much.

  ◠+ STOP,—if you have what they want, they will buy. They are pretty
  “_fly_” (knowing).

  ⸧— GO IN THIS DIRECTION, it is better than the other road. Nothing
  that way.

  ◇ _BONE_ (good). Safe for a “cold tatur,” if for nothing else.
  “_Cheese your patter_” (don’t talk much) here.

  ▽ _COOPER’D_ (spoilt), by too many tramps calling there.

  □ _GAMMY_ (unfavourable), likely to have you taken up. Mind the dog.

  ☉ _FLUMMUXED_ (dangerous), sure of a month in “_quod_” (prison).

  ⊕ _RELIGIOUS_, but tidy on the whole.

Where did these signs come from, and when were they first used?
are questions which I have asked myself again and again, whilst
endeavouring to discover their history. Knowing the character of the
Gipseys, and ascertaining from a tramp that they are well acquainted
with the hieroglyphics, “and have been as long ago as ever he could
remember,” I have little hesitation in ascribing the invention to
them. And strange it would be if some modern Belzoni, or Champollion,
discovered in these beggars’ marks fragments of ancient Egyptian or
Hindoo hieroglyphical writing! But this, of course, is a simple vagary
of the imagination.

That the Gipseys were in the habit of leaving memorials of the road
they had taken, and the successes that had befallen them, there can
be no doubt. In an old book, _The Triumph of Wit_, 1724, there is a
passage which appears to have been copied from some older work, and
it runs thus:—“The Gipseys set out twice a year, and scatter all over
England, each parcel having their appointed stages, that they may not
interfere, nor hinder each other; and for that purpose, when they set
forward in the country, _they stick up boughs in the way of divers
kinds, according as it is agreed among them, that one company may know
which way another is gone, and so take a different road_.” The works of
_Hoyland_ and _Borrow_ supply other instances.

I cannot close this subject without drawing attention to the
extraordinary fact, that actually on the threshold of the gibbet the
sign of the vagabond is to be met with! “The murderer’s signal is even
exhibited from the gallows; as a red handkerchief held in the hand of
the felon about to be executed is a token that he dies without having
betrayed any professional secrets.”[34]

Since the first edition of this work was published the author has
received from various parts of England numerous evidences of the
still active use of beggars’ marks, and mendicant hieroglyphics. One
gentleman writes from Great Yarmouth to say that only a short time
since, whilst residing in Norwich, he used frequently to see them on
the houses and street corners. From another gentleman, a clergyman, I
learn that he has so far made himself acquainted with the meanings of
the signs employed, that by himself marking the characters □ (_Gammy_)
or ☉ (_Flummuxed_) on the gate posts of his parsonage, he enjoys a
singular immunity from alms-seekers of all orders.




THE HISTORY OF SLANG,

OR THE VULGAR LANGUAGE OF FAST LIFE.


SLANG is the language of street humour, of fast, high, and low life.
CANT, as was stated in the chapter upon that subject, is the vulgar
language of secrecy. They are both universal and ancient, and appear
to have been the peculiar concomitants of gay, vulgar, or worthless
persons in every part of the world, at every period of time. Indeed, if
we are to believe implicitly the saying of _the_ wise man, that “there
is nothing new under the sun,” the “fast” men of buried Nineveh, with
their knotty and door-matty looking beards, may have cracked Slang
jokes on the steps of Sennacherib’s palace; and the stocks and stones
of Ancient Egypt, and the bricks of venerable and used-up Babylon,
may, for aught we know, be covered with Slang hieroglyphics unknown
to modern antiquarians, and which have long been stumbling-blocks to
the philologist; so impossible is it at this day to say what was then
authorised, or what then vulgar language. Slang is as old as speech
and the congregating together of people in cities. It is the result of
crowding, and excitement, and artificial life. Even to the classics
it was not unknown, as witness the pages of Aristophanes and Plautus,
Terence and Athenæus. Martial, the epigrammatist, is full of Slang.
When an uninvited guest accompanied his friend, the Slang of the day
styled him his UMBRA; when a man was trussed, neck and heels, it called
him jocosely QUADRUPUS.

Old English Slang was coarser, and depended more upon downright
vulgarity than our modern Slang. It was a jesting speech, or humorous
indulgence for the thoughtless moment, or the drunken hour, and it
acted as a vent-peg for a fit of temper or irritability; but it did not
interlard and permeate every description of conversation as now. It
was confined to nick-names and improper subjects, and encroached but
to a very small extent upon the domain of authorised speech. Indeed,
it was exceedingly limited when compared with the vast territory of
Slang in such general favour and complete circulation at the present
day. Still, although not an alarming encumbrance, as in our time,
Slang certainly did exist in this country centuries ago, as we may
see if we look down the page of any respectable History of England.
Cromwell was familiarly called OLD NOLL,—just the same as Buonaparte
was termed BONEY, and Wellington CONKEY, or NOSEY, only a few years
ago. His Legislature, too, was spoken of in a high-flavoured way as
the BAREBONES, or RUMP Parliament, and his followers were nicknamed
ROUNDHEADS, and the peculiar religious sects of his protectorate were
styled PURITANS and QUAKERS.[35] The Civil War pamphlets, and the
satirical hits of the Cavaliers and the Commonwealth men, originated
numerous Slang words and vulgar similes, in full use at the present
moment. Here is a field of inquiry for the Philological Society, indeed
I may say a territory, for there are thirty thousand of these partisan
tracts. Later still, in the court of Charles the Second, the naughty
ladies and the gay lords, with Rochester at their head, talked Slang;
and very naughty Slang it was too! Fops, in those days, when “over
head and ears” in debt, and in continual fear of arrest, termed their
enemies, the bailiffs, PHILISTINES[36] or MOABITES. At a later period,
when collars were worn detached from shirts, in order to save the
expense of washing—an object it would seem with needy “swells” in all
ages—they obtained the name of JACOBITES. One half of the coarse wit in
Butler’s Hudibras lurks in the vulgar words and phrases which he was
so fond of employing. They were more homely and forcible than the mild
and elegant sentences of Cowley, and the people, therefore, hurrah’d
them, and pronounced Butler one of themselves,—or, as we should say, in
a joyful moment, a jolly good fellow. Orator Henley preached and prayed
in Slang, and first charmed and then swayed the dirty mobs in Lincoln’s
Inn Fields by vulgarisms. Burly Grose mentions Henley, with the remark
that we owe a great many Slang phrases to him. Swift, and old Sir Roger
L’Estrange, and Arbuthnot, were all fond of vulgar or Slang language;
indeed, we may see from a Slang word used by the latter how curious
is the gradual adoption of vulgar terms in our standard dictionaries.
The worthy doctor, in order to annihilate (or, as we should say with a
fitting respect to the subject under consideration, SMASH) an opponent,
thought proper on an occasion to use the word CABBAGE, not in the
ancient and esculentary sense of a flatulent vegetable of the kitchen
garden, but in the at once Slang sense of purloining or cribbing.
Johnson soon met with the word, looked at it, examined it, weighed it,
and shook his head, but out of respect to a brother doctor inserted it
in his dictionary, labelling it, however, prominently “_Cant_;” whilst
Walker and Webster, years after, when _to cabbage_ was to _pilfer_ all
over England, placed the term in their dictionaries as an ancient and
very respectable word. Another Slang term, GULL, to cheat, or delude,
sometimes varied to GULLY, is stated to be connected with the Dean
of St. Patrick. GULL, a dupe, or a fool, is often used by our old
dramatists, and is generally believed to have given rise to the verb;
but a curious little edition of _Bamfylde Moore Carew_, published in
1827, says that TO GULL, or GULLY, is derived from the well known
_Gulliver_, the hero of the famous _Travels_. How crammed with Slang
are the dramatic works of the last century! The writers of the comedies
and farces in those days must have lived in the streets, and written
their plays in the public-houses, so filled are they with vulgarisms
and unauthorised words. The popular phrases, “I owe you one,” “that’s
one for his nob,” and “keep moving, dad,” arose in this way.[37] The
second of these sayings was, doubtless, taken from the card table, for
at cribbage the player who holds the knave of the suit turned up counts
“one for his nob,” and the dealer who turns up a knave counts “two for
his heels.”

In Mrs. Centlivre’s admirable comedy of _A Bold Stroke for a Wife_,
we see the origin of that popular street phrase, THE REAL SIMON PURE.
Simon Pure is the Quaker name adopted by Colonel Feignwell as a trick
to obtain the hand of Mistress Anne Lovely in marriage. The veritable
Quaker, the “real Simon Pure,” recommended by Aminadab Holdfast, of
Bristol, as a fit sojourner with Obadiah Prim, arrives at last to
the discomfiture of the Colonel, who, to maintain his position and
gain time, concocts a letter in which the real Quaker is spoken of as
a housebreaker who had travelled in the “leather conveniency” from
Bristol, and adopted the garb and name of the Western Quaker in order
to pass off as the “REAL SIMON PURE,” but only for the purpose of
robbing the house and cutting the throat of the perplexed Obadiah. The
scene in which the two Simon Pures, the _real_ and the _counterfeit_,
meet, is one of the best in the comedy.

Tom Brown, of “facetious memory,” as his friends were wont to say, and
Ned Ward, who wrote humorous books, and when tired drew beer for his
customers at his ale-house in Long Acre,[38] were both great producers
of Slang in the last century, and to them we owe many popular current
phrases and household words.

Written Slang was checked rather than advanced by the pens of Addison,
Johnson, and Goldsmith, although John Bee, the bottle-holder and
historiographer of the pugilistic band of brothers in the youthful
days of flat-nosed Tom Crib, has gravely stated that Johnson, when
young and rakish, contributed to an early volume of the _Gentleman’s
Magazine_ a few pages, by way of specimen, of a Slang dictionary, the
result, Mr. Bee says, “of his midnight ramblings!”[39] And Goldsmith,
I must not forget to remark, certainly coined a few words, although,
as a rule, his pen was pure and graceful, and adverse to neologisms.
The word FUDGE, it has been stated, was first used by him in literary
composition, although it originated with one Captain Fudge, a notorious
fibber, nearly a century before. Street-phrases, nick-names, and
vulgar words were continually being added to the great stock of
popular Slang up to the commencement of the present century, when it
received numerous additions from pugilism, horse-racing, and “fast”
life generally, which suddenly came into great public favour, and
was at its height when the Prince Regent was in his rakish minority.
Slang in those days was generally termed FLASH language. So popular
was it with the “bloods” of high life that it constituted the best
paying literary capital for certain authors and dramatists. Pierce Egan
issued _Boxiana_, and _Life in London_, six portly octavo volumes,
crammed with Slang; and Moncrieff wrote the most popular farce of
the day, _Tom and Jerry_ (adapted from the latter work), which, to
use newspaper Slang, “took the town by storm,” and, with its then
fashionable vulgarisms, made the fortune of the old Adelphi Theatre,
and was, without exception, the most wonderful instance of a continuous
theatrical RUN in ancient or modern times. This, also, was brimful of
Slang. Other authors helped to popularise and extend Slang down to our
own time, when it has taken a somewhat different turn, dropping many
of the Cant and old vulgar words, and assuming a certain quaint and
fashionable phraseology—Frenchy, familiar, utilitarian, and jovial.
There can be no doubt but that common speech is greatly influenced by
fashion, fresh manners, and that general change of ideas which steals
over a people once in a generation. But before I proceed further
into the region of _Slang_, it will be well to say something on the
etymology of the word.

The word SLANG is only mentioned by two lexicographers—Webster and
Ogilvie. Johnson, Walker, and the older compilers of dictionaries, give
_slang_ the preterite of _sling_, but not a word about SLANG in the
sense of low, vulgar, or unrecognised language. The origin of the word
has often been asked for in literary journals and books, but only one
man, as far as I can learn, has ever hazarded an etymology—Jonathan
Bee, the vulgar chronicler of the prize-ring.[40] With a recklessness
peculiar to pugilism, Bee stated that SLANG was derived from “the
_slangs_ or fetters worn by prisoners, having acquired that name from
the manner in which they were worn, as they required a sling of string
to keep them off the ground.” Bee had just been nettled at Pierce Egan
producing a new edition of _Grose’s Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_,
and was determined to excel him in a vulgar dictionary of his own,
which should be more racy, more pugilistic, and more original. How far
he succeeded in this latter particular his ridiculous etymology of
Slang will show. SLANG is not an English word, it is the Gipsey term
for their secret language, and its synonyme is GIBBERISH—another word
which was believed to have had no distinct origin.[41] Grose—stout and
burly Captain Grose—who we may characterise as the greatest antiquary,
joker, and drinker of porter of his day, was the first author who put
the word SLANG into print. It occurs in his _Classical Dictionary of
the Vulgar Tongue_, of 1785, with the signification that it implies
“Cant or vulgar language.” Grose, I may remark in passing, was a
great favourite with the poet Burns, and so pleased by his extensive
powers of story-telling and grog-imbibing, that the companionable and
humour-loving Scotch bard wrote for his fat friend—or, to use his
own words, “the fine, fat, fodgel wight”—the immortal poem of “Tam
O’Shanter.”

Without troubling the reader with a long account of the transformation
into an English term of the word SLANG, I may remark in passing that
it is easily seen how we obtained it from the Gipseys. Hucksters and
beggars on tramp, or at fairs and races, associate and frequently join
in any rough enterprise with the Gipseys. The word would be continually
heard by them, and would in this manner soon become CANT;[42] and, when
carried by “fast” or vulgar fashionables from the society of thieves
and low characters to their own drawing-rooms, would as quickly become
SLANG, and the representative term for all vulgar or Slang language.

Any sudden excitement, peculiar circumstance, or popular literary
production, is quite sufficient to originate and set going a score
of Slang words. Nearly every election or public agitation throws
out offshoots of the excitement, or scintillations of the humour
in the shape of Slang terms—vulgar at first, but at length adopted
as semi-respectable from the force of habit and custom. There is
scarcely a condition or calling in life that does not possess its own
peculiar Slang. The professions, legal and medical, have each familiar
and unauthorised terms for peculiar circumstances and things, and
I am quite certain that the clerical calling, or “_the cloth_,” is
not entirely free from this peculiarity. Every workshop, warehouse,
factory, and mill throughout the country has its Slang, and so have
the public schools of Eton, Harrow, and Westminster, and the great
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Sea Slang constitutes the
principal charm of a sailor’s “yarn,” and our soldiers and officers
have each their peculiar nicknames and terms for things and subjects
proper and improper. A writer in _Household Words_ (No. 183) has
gone so far as to remark, that a person “shall not read one single
parliamentary debate, as reported in a first-class newspaper, without
meeting scores of Slang words;” and “that from Mr. Speaker in his
chair, to the Cabinet Ministers whispering behind it—from mover to
seconder, from true blue Protectionist to extremest Radical—Mr. Barry’s
New House echoes and re-echoes with Slang.” Really it seems as if our
boasted English tongue was a very paltry and ill-provided contrivance
after all; or can it be that we are the most vulgar of people?

The universality of Slang is extraordinary. Let any person for a short
time narrowly examine the conversation of their dearest and nearest
friends, aye, censor-like, even slice and analyse their own supposed
correct talk, and they shall be amazed at the numerous unauthorised,
and what we can only call vulgar, words they continually employ. It is
not the number of new words that we are ever introducing that is so
reprehensible, there is not so much harm in this practice (frequently
termed in books “the license of expression”) if neologisms are really
required, but it is the continually encumbering of _old_ words with
fresh and strange meanings. Look at those simple and useful verbs,
_do_, _cut_, _go_, and _take_, and see how they are hampered and
overloaded, and then let us ask ourselves how it is that a French
or German gentleman, be he ever so well educated, is continually
blundering and floundering amongst our _little_ words when trying
to make himself understood in an ordinary conversation. He may have
studied our language the required time, and have gone through the usual
amount of “grinding,” and practised the common allotment of patience,
but all to no purpose as far as accuracy is concerned. I am aware that
most new words are generally regarded as Slang, although afterwards
they may become useful and respectable additions to our standard
dictionaries. JABBER and HOAX were Slang and Cant terms in Swift’s
time; so indeed were MOB and SHAM.[43] Words directly from the Latin
and Greek, and Carlyleisms, are allowed by an indulgent public to pass
and take their places in books. Sound contributes many Slang words—a
source that etymologists too frequently overlook. Nothing pleases an
ignorant person more than a high-sounding term “full of fury.” How
melodious and drum-like are those vulgar coruscations RUMBUMPTIOUS,
SLANTINGDICULAR, SPLENDIFEROUS, RUMBUSTIOUS, and FERRICADOUZER. What
a “pull” the sharp-nosed lodging-house keeper thinks she has over her
victims if she can but hurl such testimonies of a liberal education
at them when they are disputing her charges, and threatening to
ABSQUATULATE! In the United States the vulgar-genteel even excel the
poor “stuck-up” Cockneys in their formation of a native fashionable
language. How charming to a refined ear are ABSKIZE, CATAWAMPOUSLY,
EXFLUNCTIFY, OBSCUTE, KESLOSH, KESOUSE, KESWOLLOP, and KEWHOLLUX!
Vulgar words representing action and brisk movement often owe their
origin to sound. Mispronunciation, too, is another great source of
vulgar or slang words—RAMSHACKLE, SHACKLY, NARY-ONE for neither, or
neither one, OTTOMY for anatomy, RENCH for rinse, are specimens.
The commonalty dislike frequently occurring words difficult of
pronunciation, and so we have the street abridgments of BIMEBY for by
and by, CAZE for because, GIN for given, HANKERCHER for handkerchief,
RUMATIZ for rheumatism, BACKY for tobacco, and many others, not perhaps
Slang, but certainly all vulgarisms. Archbishop Whately, in his
interesting _Remains of Bishop Copleston_, has inserted a leaf from the
Bishop’s note-book on the popular corruption of names, mentioning among
others KICKSHAWS, as from the French, _quelques choses_; BEEFEATER,
the lubberly guardian of royalty in a procession, and the supposed
devourer of enormous beefsteaks, as but a vulgar pronunciation of the
French, _buffetier_; and GEORGE and CANNON, the sign of a public-house,
as nothing but a corruption (although so soon!) of the popular premier
of the last generation, _George Canning_. Literature has its Slang
terms; and the desire on the part of writers to say funny and startling
things in a novel and curious way (the late _Household Words_,[44] for
instance), contributes many unauthorised words to the great stock of
Slang.

_Fashionable_, or _Upper-class Slang_, is of several varieties. There
is the Belgravian, military and naval, parliamentary, dandy, and the
reunion and visiting Slang. Concerning the Slang of the fashionable
world, a writer in _Household Words_ curiously, but not altogether
truthfully, remarks, that it is mostly imported from France; and
that an unmeaning gibberish of Gallicisms runs through English
fashionable conversation, and fashionable novels, and accounts of
fashionable parties in the fashionable newspapers. Yet, ludicrously
enough, immediately the fashionable magnates of England seize on any
French idiom, the French themselves not only universally abandon it
to us, but positively repudiate it altogether from their idiomatic
vocabulary. If you were to tell a well-bred Frenchman that such and
such an aristocratic marriage was on the _tapis_, he would stare with
astonishment, and look down on the carpet in the startled endeavour
to find a marriage in so unusual a place. If you were to talk to him
of the _beau monde_, he would imagine you meant the world which God
made, not half-a-dozen streets and squares between Hyde Park Corner
and Chelsea Bun House. The _thé dansante_[45] would be completely
inexplicable to him. If you were to point out to him the Dowager Lady
Grimguffin acting as _chaperon_ to Lady Amanda Creamville, he would
imagine you were referring to the _petit Chaperon rouge_—to little Red
Riding Hood. He might just understand what was meant by _vis-a-vis_,
_entremets_, and some others of the flying horde of frivolous little
foreign slangisms hovering about fashionable cookery and fashionable
furniture; but three-fourths of them would seem to him as barbarous
French provincialisms, or, at best, but as antiquated and obsolete
expressions, picked out of the letters of Mademoiselle Scuderi, or the
tales of Crebillon the “younger.” Servants, too, appropriate the scraps
of French conversation which fall from their masters’ guests at the
dinner table, and forthwith in the world of flunkeydom the word “know”
is disused, and the lady’s maid, in doubt on a particular point, asks
John whether or no he SAVEYS it?[46] What, too, can be more abominable
than that heartless piece of fashionable newspaper Slang, regularly
employed when speaking of the successful courtship of young people in
the fashionable world:—

  MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE.—We understand that a marriage is ARRANGED (!)
  betwixt the Lady, &c. &c., and the Honourable, &c. &c.

ARRANGED! Is that cold-blooded Smithfield or Mark-lane term for a
sale or a purchase the proper word to express the hopeful, joyous,
golden union of young and trustful hearts? Which is the proper way to
pronounce the names of great people, and what the correct authority?
Lord Cowper, we are often assured, is Lord _Cooper_—on this principle
Lord Cowley would certainly be Lord _Cooley_—and Mr. Carew, we are
told, should be Mr. _Carey_, Ponsonby should be _Punsunby_, Eyre
should he _Aire_, Cholmondeley should be _Chumley_, St. John _Singen_,
Majoribanks _Marshbanks_, Derby _Darby_ (its ancient pronunciation),
and Powell should always be _Poel_. I don’t know that these lofty
persons have as much cause to complain of the illiberality of fate in
giving them disagreeable names as did the celebrated Psyche (as she was
termed by Tom Moore), whose original name, through her husband, was
_Teague_, but which was afterwards altered to Tighe.

_Parliamentary Slang_, excepting a few peculiar terms connected with
“_the_ House” (scarcely Slang, I suppose), is mainly composed of
fashionable, literary, and learned Slang. When members, however, get
excited and wish to be forcible, they are often not very particular
which of the street terms they select, providing it carries, as
good old Dr. South said, plenty of wild-fire in it. Sir Hugh Cairns
very lately spoke of “that homely but expressive phrase, DODGE.”
Out of “the House,” several Slang terms are used in connection with
Parliament or members of Parliament. If Lord Palmerston is known by
name to the tribes of the Caucasus and Asia Minor as a great foreign
diplomatist, when the name of our Queen Victoria is an unknown title
to the inhabitants of those parts—as was stated in the _Times_ a short
time ago,—I have only to remark that amongst the costers and the wild
inhabitants of the streets he is better known as PAM. I have often
heard the cabmen on the “ranks” in Piccadilly remark of the late
Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he has been going from his residence
at Grosvenor Gate, to Derby House in St. James’s Square,—“hollo,
there! de yer see old DIZZY doing a stump?” A PLUMPER is a single vote
at an election,—not a SPLIT-TICKET; and electors who have occupied a
house, no matter how small, and boiled a pot in it, thus qualifying
themselves for voting, are termed POT-WOLLOPERS. A quiet WALK OVER
is a re-election without opposition and much cost. A CAUCUS meeting
refers to the private assembling of politicians before an election,
when candidates are chosen and measures of action agreed upon. The term
comes from America. A JOB, in political phraseology, is a government
office or contract obtained by secret influence or favouritism. Only
the other day the _Times_ spoke of “the patriotic member of Parliament
POTTED OUT in a dusty little lodging somewhere about Bury-street.”
The term QUOCKERWODGER, although referring to a wooden toy figure
which jerks its limbs about when pulled by a string, has been
supplemented with a political meaning. A pseudo-politician, one whose
strings of action are pulled by somebody else, is now often termed
a QUOCKERWODGER. The term RAT, too, in allusion to rats deserting
vessels about to sink, has long been employed towards those turncoat
politicians who change their party for interest. Who that occasionally
passes near the Houses of Parliament has not often noticed stout or
careful M.P.s walk briskly through the Hall and on the curb-stone in
front, with umbrella or walking cane uplifted, shout to the cabmen
on the rank, FOUR-WHEELER! The term is a useful one, but I am afraid
we must consider it Slang, until it is stamped with the mint mark of
lexicographical authority.[47]

_Military_, or _Officers’ Slang_ is on a par, and of a character
with _Dandy Slang_. Inconvenient friends, or elderly and lecturing
relatives, are pronounced DREADFUL BORES. Four-wheel cabs are called
BOUNDERS; and a member of the Four-in-hand Club, driving to Epsom on
the Derby day, would, using fashionable slang phraseology, speak of
it as TOOLING HIS DRAG DOWN TO THE DERBY. A vehicle, if not a DRAG
(or dwag) is a TRAP, or a CASK; and if the TURN OUT happens to be in
other than a trim condition, it is pronounced at once as not DOWN
THE ROAD. Your city swell would say it is not UP TO THE MARK; whilst
the costermonger would call it WERY DICKEY. In the army a barrack
or military station is known as a LOBSTER-BOX; to “cram” for an
examination is to MUG-UP; to reject from the examination is to SPIN;
and that part of the barrack occupied by subalterns is frequently
spoken of as the ROOKERY. In dandy or swell Slang, any celebrity, from
Robson of the Olympic, to the Pope of Rome, is a SWELL. Wrinkled faced
old professors, who hold dress and fashionable tailors in abhorrence,
are called AWFUL SWELLS,—if they happen to be very learned or clever.
I may remark that in this upper class Slang a title is termed a
HANDLE; trousers, INEXPRESSIBLES; or when of a large pattern, or the
inflated Zouave cut, HOWLING BAGS; a superior appearance, EXTENSIVE; a
four-wheeled cab, a BIRDCAGE; a dance, a HOP; dining at another man’s
table, “sitting under his MAHOGANY;” anything flashy or showy, LOUD;
the peculiar make or cut of a coat, its BUILD; full dress, FULL-FIG;
wearing clothes which represent the very extreme of fashion, “dressing
to DEATH;” a reunion, a SPREAD; a friend (or a “good fellow”), a TRUMP;
a difficulty, a SCREW LOOSE; and everything that is unpleasant, “from
bad sherry to a writ from a tailor,” JEUCED INFERNAL. The military
phrase, “to send a man to COVENTRY,” or permit no person to speak to
him, although an ancient saying, must still be considered Slang.

The _Universities of Oxford and Cambridge_, and the great public
schools, are the hotbeds of fashionable Slang. Growing boys and
high-spirited young fellows detest restraint of all kinds, and prefer
making a dash at life in a Slang phraseology of their own, to all the
set forms and syntactical rules of _Alma Mater_. Many of the most
expressive words in a common chit-chat, or free-and-easy conversation,
are old University vulgarisms. CUT, in the sense of dropping an
acquaintance, was originally a Cambridge form of speech; and HOAX, to
deceive or ridicule, we are informed by Grose, was many years since an
Oxford term. Among the words that fast society has borrowed from our
great scholastic [I was going to say _establishments_, but I remembered
the linen drapers’ horrid and habitual use of the word] institutions,
I find CRIB, a house or apartments; DEAD-MEN, empty wine bottles;
DRAWING TEETH,[48] wrenching off knockers; FIZZING, first-rate, or
splendid; GOVERNOR, or RELIEVING OFFICER, the general term for a male
parent; PLUCKED, defeated or turned back; QUIZ, to scrutinise, or a
prying old fellow; and ROW, a noisy disturbance. The Slang words in
use at Oxford and Cambridge would alone fill a volume. As examples
I may instance SCOUT, which at Oxford refers to an undergraduate’s
valet, whilst the same menial at Cambridge is termed a GYP,—popularly
derived by the Cantabs from the Greek, GYPS (γυψ), a vulture; SCULL,
the head, or master of a college; BATTLES, the Oxford term for rations,
changed at Cambridge into COMMONS. The term DICKEY, a half shirt, I
am told, originated with the students of Trinity College, Dublin, who
at first styled it a TOMMY, from the Greek, τομη, a section. CRIB,
a literal translation, is now universal; GRIND refers to a walk,
or “constitutional;” HIVITE is a student of St. Begh’s (St. Bee’s)
College, Cumberland; to JAPAN, in this Slang speech, is to ordain;
MORTAR-BOARD is a square college cap; SIM a student of a Methodistical
turn,—in allusion to the Rev. Charles Simeon; SLOGGERS, at Cambridge,
refers to the second division of race boats, known at Oxford as
TORPIDS; SPORT is to show or exhibit; TROTTER is the jocose term for a
tailor’s man who goes round for orders; and TUFTS are wealthy students
who dine with the DONS, and are distinguished by golden _tufts_, or
tassels, in their caps. There are many terms in use at Oxford not known
at Cambridge; and such Slang names as COACH, GULF, HARRY-SOPH, POKER,
or POST-MORTEM, common enough at Cambridge, are seldom or never heard
at the great sister University. For numerous other examples of college
Slang, the reader is referred to the Dictionary.

_Religious Slang_, strange as the compound may appear, exists with
other descriptions of vulgar speech at the present day. _Punch_, a
short time since, in one of those half-humorous, half-serious articles
in which he is so fond of lecturing any national abuse or popular
folly, remarked that Slang had “long since penetrated into the Forum,
and now we meet it in the Senate, _and even the Pulpit itself is no
longer free from its intrusion_.” I would not, for one moment, wish to
infer that the practice is general. On the contrary, and in justice to
the clergy, it must be said that the principal disseminators of pure
English throughout the country are the ministers of our Established
Church. Yet it cannot be denied but that a great deal of Slang
phraseology and disagreeable vulgarism have gradually crept into the
very pulpits which should give forth as pure speech as doctrine.

Dean Conybeare, in his able _Essay on Church Parties_,[49] has
noticed this wretched addition to our pulpit speech. As stated in
his Essay, the practice appears to confine itself mainly to the
exaggerated forms of the High and Low Church—the Tractarians and
the “Recordites.”[50] By way of illustration, the Dean cites the
evening parties, or social meetings, common amongst the wealthier lay
members of the Recordite (exaggerated Evangelical) Churches, where
the principal topics discussed—one or more favourite clergymen being
present in a quasi-official manner—are “the merits and demerits of
different preachers, the approaching restoration of the Jews, the date
of the Millennium, the progress of the ‘Tractarian heresy,’ and the
anticipated ‘perversion’ of High Church neighbours.” These subjects are
canvassed in a dialect differing considerably from common English. The
words FAITHFUL, TAINTED, ACCEPTABLE, DECIDED, LEGAL, and many others,
are used in a technical sense. We hear that Mr. A. has been more OWNED
than Mr. B; and that Mr. C. has more SEALS[51] than Mr. D. Again, the
word GRACIOUS is invested with a meaning as extensive as that attached
by young ladies to _nice_. Thus, we hear of a “GRACIOUS sermon,” a
“GRACIOUS meeting,” a “GRACIOUS child,” and even a “GRACIOUS whipping.”
The word DARK has also a new and peculiar usage. It is applied to every
person, book, or place, not impregnated with Recordite principles. We
once were witnesses of a ludicrous misunderstanding resulting from this
phraseology. “What did you mean (said A. to B.) by telling me that ——
was such a very DARK village? I rode over there to day, and found the
street particularly broad and cheerful, and there is not a tree in the
place.” “_The Gospel is not preached there_,” was B.’s laconic reply.
The conclusion of one of these singular evening parties is generally
marked by an “_exposition_”—an unseasonable sermon of nearly one hour’s
duration, circumscribed by no text, and delivered from the table by
one of the clerical visitors with a view to “improve the occasion.” In
the same Essay, the religious Slang terms for the two great divisions
of the Established Church, receive some explanation. The old-fashioned
High Church party, rich and “stagnant,” noted for its “sluggish
mediocrity, hatred of zeal, dread of innovation, abuse of dissent,
blundering and languid utterance,” is called the HIGH AND DRY; whilst
the corresponding division, known as the Low Church, equally stagnant
with the former, but poorer, and more lazily inclined (from absence
of education), to dissent, receives the nickname of the LOW AND SLOW.
Already have these terms become so familiar that they are shortened, in
ordinary conversation, to the DRY and the SLOW. The so-called “Broad
Church,” I should remark, is often spoken of as the BROAD AND SHALLOW.

What can be more objectionable than the irreverent and offensive
manner in which many of the dissenting ministers continually pronounce
the names of the Deity, God and Lord. God, instead of pronouncing in
the plain and beautifully simple old English way, G-O-D, they drawl
out into GORDE or GAUDE; and Lord, instead of speaking in the proper
way, they desecrate into LOARD or LOERD,—lingering on the _u_, or
the _r_, as the case may be, until an honest hearer feels disgusted,
and almost inclined to run the gauntlet of beadles and deacons, and
pull the vulgar preacher from his pulpit. I have observed that many
young preachers strive hard to acquire this peculiar pronunciation,
in imitation of the older ministers. What can more properly, then, be
called Slang, or, indeed, the most objectionable of Slang, than this
studious endeavour to pronounce the most sacred names in a uniformly
vulgar and unbecoming manner. If the old-fashioned preacher whistled
Cant through his nose, the modern vulgar reverend whines Slang from
the more natural organ. These vagaries of speech will, perhaps, by
an apologist, he termed “pulpit peculiarities,” and the writer dared
to intermeddle with a subject that is or should be removed from his
criticisms. The terms used by the mob towards the Church, however
illiberal and satirically vulgar, are within his province in such an
inquiry as the present. A clergyman, in vulgar language, is spoken of
as a CHOKER, a CUSHION THUMPER, a DOMINE, an EARWIG, a GOSPEL GRINDER,
a GRAY COAT PARSON—if he is a lessee of the great tithes, ONE IN TEN,
PADRE—if spoken of by an Anglo-Indian, a ROOK, a SPOUTER, a WHITE
CHOKER, or a WARMING PAN RECTOR, if he only holds the living _pro
tempore_, or is simply keeping the place warm for his successor. If a
Tractarian, his outer garment is rudely spoken of as a PYGOSTOLE, or
M.B. (MARK OF THE BEAST) COAT. His profession is termed THE CLOTH, and
his practice TUB THUMPING. Should he belong to the dissenting body,
he is probably styled a PANTILER, or a PSALM SMITER, or, perhaps, a
SWADDLER. His chapel, too, is spoken of as a SCHISM SHOP. A Roman
Catholic, I may remark, is coarsely named a BRISKET BEATER.

Particular as lawyers generally are about the meaning of words, they
have not prevented an unauthorised phraseology from arising, which
we may term _Legal Slang_. So forcibly did this truth impress a late
writer, that he wrote in a popular journal, “You may hear Slang every
day in term from barristers in their robes, at every mess-table,
at every bar-mess, at every college commons, and in every club
dining-room.” Swift, in his _Art of Polite Conversation_ (p. 15),
published a century and a half ago, states that VARDI was the Slang
in his time for “verdict.” A few of the most common and well-known
terms used out of doors, with reference to legal matters, are COOK, to
hash or make up a balance-sheet; DIPPED, mortgaged; DUN, to solicit
payment; FULLIED, to be “_fully_ committed for trial;” LAND-SHARK, a
sailor’s definition of a lawyer; LIMB OF THE LAW, a milder term for
the same “professional;” MONKEY WITH A LONG TAIL, a mortgage—phrase
used in the well-known case for libel, Smith _v._ Jones; MOUTHPIECE,
the coster’s term for his counsel; “to go through the RING,” to take
advantage of the Insolvency Act; SMASH, to become bankrupt; SNIPE, an
attorney with a long bill; and WHITEWASHED, said of any debtor who has
taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act. Lawyers, from their connection
with the police courts, and transactions with persons in every grade of
society, have ample opportunities for acquiring street Slang, which in
cross-questioning and wrangling they frequently avail themselves of.

It has been said there exists a _Literary Slang_, or “the _Slang
of Criticism_—dramatic, artistic, and scientific. Such words as
‘æsthetic,’ ‘transcendental,’ the ‘harmonies,’ the ‘unities,’ a
‘myth:’ such phrases as ‘an exquisite _morceau_ on the big drum,’ a
‘scholarlike rendering of John the Baptist’s great toe,’ ‘keeping
harmony,’ ‘middle distance,’ ‘ærial perspective,’ ‘delicate handling,’
‘nervous chiaroscuro,’ and the like.” More than one literary journal
that I could name are fond of employing such terms in their art
criticisms, but it is questionable, after all, whether they are not
allowable as the generous inflections and bendings of a bountiful
language, for the purpose of expressing fresh phases of thought, and
ideas not yet provided with representative words.[52] The well-known
and ever-acceptable _Punch_, with his fresh and choice little pictorial
bits by Leech, often employs a Slang term to give point to a joke,
or humour to a line of satire. A short time since (4th May, 1859) he
gave an original etymology of the school-boy-ism SLOG. SLOG, said the
classical and studious _Punch_, is derived from the Greek word SLOGO,
to baste, to wallop, to slaughter. And it was not long ago that he
amused his readers with two columns on _Slang and Sanscrit_:—

  “The allegory which pervades the conversation of all Eastern
  nations,” remarked the philosophical _Punch_, “is the foundation
  of Western Slang; and the increased number of students of the
  Oriental languages, especially since Sanscrit and Arabic have been
  made subjects for the Indian Civil Service Examinations, may have
  contributed to supply the English language with a large portion of
  its new dialect. While, however, the spirit of allegory comes from
  the East, there is so great a difference between the brevity of
  Western expression and the more cumbrous diction of the Oriental,
  that the origin of a phrase becomes difficult to trace. Thus, for
  instance, whilst the Turkish merchant might address his friend
  somewhat as follows—‘That which seems good to my father is to his
  servant as the perfumed breath of the west wind in the calm night of
  the Arabian summer;’ the Western negociator observes more briefly,
  ‘ALL SERENE!’”

But the vulgar term, BRICK, _Punch_ remarks in illustration,

  “must be allowed to be an exception, its Greek derivation being
  universally admitted, corresponding so exactly as it does in its
  rectangular form and compactness to the perfection of manhood,
  according to the views of _Plato_ and _Simonides_; but any deviation
  from the simple expression, in which locality is indicated,—as, for
  instance, ‘a genuine Bath,’—decidedly breathes the Oriental spirit.”

It is singular that what _Punch_ says, unwittingly and in humour,
respecting the Slang expression, BOSH, should be quite true. BOSH,
remarks _Punch_, after speaking of it as belonging to the stock of
words pilfered from the Turks, “is one whose innate force and beauty
the slangographer is reluctantly compelled to admit. It is the only
word which seems a proper appellation for a great deal which we are
obliged to hear and to read every day of our life.” BOSH, nonsense
or stupidity, is derived from the _Gipsey_ and the _Persian_. The
universality of Slang, I may here remark, is proved by its continual
use in the pages of _Punch_. Whoever thinks, unless belonging to a
past generation, of asking a friend to explain the stray vulgar words
employed by the _London Charivari_?

The _Athenæum_, the most learned and censor-like of all the “weeklies,”
often indulges in a Slang word, when force of expression or a little
humour is desired, or when the writer wishes to say something which
is better said in Slang, or so-called vulgar speech, than in the
authorised language of Dr. Johnson or Lindley Murray. It was but the
other day that a writer in its pages employed an old and favourite
word, used always when we were highly pleased with any article at
school,—STUNNING. _Bartlett_, the compiler of the _Dictionary of
Americanisms_, continually cites the _Athenæum_ as using Slang and
vulgar expressions;—but the magazine the American refers to is not
the excellent literary journal which is so esteemed at the present
day, it was a smaller, and now defunct “weekly.” Many other highly
respectable journals often use Slang words and phrases. The _Times_
(or, in Slang, the THUNDERER) frequently employs unauthorised terms;
and, following a “leader”[53] of the purest and most eloquent English
composition, may sometimes be seen another “article”[53] on a totally
different subject, containing, perhaps, a score or more of exceedingly
questionable words. Among the words and phrases which may be included
under the head of Literary Slang are,—BALAAM, matter kept constantly
in type about monstrous productions of nature, to fill up spaces in
newspapers; BALAAM BOX, the term given in _Blackwood_ to the depository
for rejected articles; and SLATE, to pelt with abuse, or CUT UP in a
review. The Slang names given to newspapers are curious;—thus, the
_Morning Advertiser_ is known as the TAP-TUB, the TIZER, and the GIN
AND GOSPEL GAZETTE. The _Morning Post_ has obtained the suggestive
_soubriquet_ of JEAMES; whilst the _Morning Herald_ has long been
caricatured as MRS. HARRIS, and the _Standard_ as MRS. GAMP.[54]

The _Stage_, of course, has its Slang—“both before and behind the
curtain,” as a journalist remarks. The stage manager is familiarly
termed DADDY; and an actor by profession, or a “professional,”
is called a PRO. A man who is occasionally hired at a trifling
remuneration to come upon the stage as one of a crowd, or when a number
of actors are wanted to give effect, is named a SUP,—an abbreviation of
“supernumerary.” A SURF is a third-rate actor who frequently pursues
another calling; and the band, or orchestra between the pit and the
stage, is generally spoken of as the MENAGERY. A BEN is a benefit;
and SAL is the Slang abbreviation of “salary.” Should no wages be
forthcoming on the Saturday night, it is said that the GHOST DOESN’T
WALK. The travelling or provincial theatricals, who perform in any
large room that can be rented in a country village, are called BARN
STORMERS. A LENGTH is forty-two lines of any dramatic composition; and
a RUN is the good or bad success of a performance. A SADDLE is the
additional charge made by a manager to an actor or actress upon their
benefit night. To MUG UP is to paint one’s face, or arrange the person
to represent a particular character; to CORPSE, or to STICK, is to
balk, or put the other actors out in their parts by forgetting yours.
A performance is spoken of as either a GOOSER or a SCREAMER, should it
be a failure or a great success;—if the latter, it is not infrequently
termed a HIT. To STAR IT is to perform as the centre of attraction,
with none but subordinates and indifferent actors in the same
performance. The expressive term CLAP-TRAP, high-sounding nonsense, is
nothing but an ancient theatrical term, and signified a TRAP to catch a
CLAP by way of applause. “Up amongst the GODS,” refers to being among
the spectators in the gallery,—termed in French Slang PARADIS.

There exists, too, in the great territory of vulgar speech what may
not inappropriately be termed _Civic Slang_. It consists of mercantile
and Stock Exchange terms, and the Slang of good living and wealth. A
turkey hung with sausages is facetiously styled AN ALDERMAN IN CHAINS;
and a half-crown, perhaps from its rotundity, is often termed an
ALDERMAN. A BEAR is a speculator on the Exchange; and a BULL, although
of another order, follows a like profession. There is something very
humorous and applicable in the slang term LAME DUCK, a defaulter in
stock-jobbing speculations. The allusion to his “waddling out of the
Alley,” as they say, is excellent. BREAKING SHINS, in City slang, is
borrowing money; a rotten or unsound scheme is spoken of as FISHY;
“RIGGING the market” means playing tricks with it; and STAG was a
common term during the railway mania for a speculator without capital,
a seller of “scrip” in “Diddlesex Junction” and other equally safe
lines. In Lombard-street a MONKEY is £500, a PLUM £100,000, and a
MARYGOLD is one million sterling. But before I proceed further in a
sketch of the different kinds of Slang, I cannot do better than to
speak here of the extraordinary number of Cant and Slang terms in use
to represent money,—from farthings to bank notes the value of fortunes.
_Her Majesty’s coin, collectively or in the piece, is insulted, by no
less than one hundred and thirty distinct Slang words_, from the humble
BROWN (a halfpenny) to FLIMSIES, or LONG-TAILED ONES (bank notes).

“Money,” it has been well remarked, “the bare, simple word itself, has
a sonorous, significant ring in its sound,” and might have sufficed,
one would have imagined, for all ordinary purposes. But a vulgar or
“fast” society has thought differently, and so we have the Slang
synonymes BEANS, BLUNT, (_i.e._, specie,—not _stiff_ or _rags_, bank
notes), BRADS, BRASS, BUSTLE, COPPERS (copper money, or mixed pence),
CHINK, CHINKERS, CHIPS, CORKS, DIBBS, DINARLY, DIMMOCK, DUST, FEATHERS,
GENT (silver,—from _argent_), HADDOCK (a purse of money), HORSE NAILS,
LOAVER, LOUR (the oldest Cant term for money), MOPUSSES, NEEDFUL,
NOBBINGS (money collected in a hat by street performers), OCHRE (gold),
PEWTER, PALM OIL, QUEEN’S PICTURES, QUIDS, RAGS (bank notes), READY, or
READY GILT, REDGE (gold), RHINO, ROWDY, SHINERS (sovereigns), SKIN (a
purse of money), STIFF (paper, or bill of acceptance), STUFF, STUMPY,
TIN (silver), WEDGE (silver), and YELLOW-BOYS (sovereigns);—just
forty-two vulgar equivalents for the simple word _money_. So attentive
is Slang speech to financial matters, that there are seven terms for
bad, or “bogus” coin (as our friends, the Americans, call it): a CASE
is a counterfeit five-shilling piece; HALF A CASE represents half that
sum; GRAYS are halfpence made double for gambling purposes; QUEER-SOFT
is counterfeit or lead coin; SCHOFEL refers to coated or spurious coin;
SHEEN is bad money of any description; and SINKERS bears the same and
not inappropriate meaning. FLYING THE KITE, or obtaining money on
bills and promissory notes, is a curious allusion to children tossing
about a paper kite; and RAISING THE WIND is a well-known phrase for
procuring money by immediate sale, pledging, or a forced loan. In
winter or in summer any elderly gentleman who may have prospered in
life is pronounced WARM; whilst an equivalent is immediately at hand in
the phrase “his pockets are well LINED.” Each separate piece of money
has its own Slang term, and often half a score of synonymes. To begin
with that extremely humble coin, a _farthing_: first we have FADGE,
then FIDDLER, then GIG, and lastly QUARTEREEN. A _halfpenny_ is a
BROWN or a MADZA SALTEE (Cant), or a MAG, or a POSH, or a RAP,—whence
the popular phrase, “I don’t care a _rap_.” The useful and universal
_penny_ has for Slang equivalents a COPPER, a SALTEE (Cant), and a
WINN. _Two-pence_ is a DEUCE, and _three-pence_ is either a THRUMS or
a THRUPS. _Four-pence_, or a _groat_, may in vulgar speech he termed
a BIT, a FLAG, or a JOEY. _Six-pence_ is well represented in street
talk, and some of the Slangisms are very comical, for instance, BANDY,
BENDER, CRIPPLE, and DOWNER; then we have FYE-BUCK, HALF A HOG, KICK
(thus “two and a kick,” or 2s. 6d.), LORD OF THE MANOR, PIG, POT (the
price of a _pot_ of beer), SNID, SPRAT, SOW’S BABY, TANNER, TESTER,
TIZZY,—sixteen vulgar words to one coin. _Seven-pence_ being an
uncommon amount has only one Slang synonyme, SETTER. The same remark
applies to _eight-pence_ and _nine-pence_, the former being only
represented by OTTER, and the latter by the Cant phrase, NOBBA-SALTEE.
_Ten-pence_ is DACHA-SALTEE, and _eleven-pence_ DACHA-ONE,—both Cant
expressions. _One shilling_ boasts ten Slang equivalents; thus we have
BEONG, BOB, BREAKY-LEG, DEANER, GEN (either from _argent_, silver, or
the back slang), HOG, PEG, STAG, TEVISS, and TWELVER. _Half-a-crown_
is known as an ALDERMAN, HALF A BULL, HALF A TUSHEROON, and a MADZA
CAROON; whilst a _crown_ piece, or _five shillings_, may be called
either a BULL, or a CAROON, or a CARTWHEEL, or a COACHWHEEL, or a
THICK-UN, or a TUSHEROON. The next advance in Slang money is _ten
shillings_, or _half-a-sovereign_, which may be either pronounced
as HALF A BEAN, HALF A COUTER, a MADZA POONA, or HALF A QUID. A
_sovereign_, or _twenty shillings_, is a BEAN, CANARY, COUTER, FOONT,
GOLDFINCH, JAMES, POONA, QUID, a THICK-UN, or a YELLOW-BOY. _Guineas_
are nearly obsolete, yet the terms NEDS, and HALF NEDS, are still in
use. Bank notes are FLIMSIES, LONG-TAILED ONES, or SOFT. A FINUF is a
five-pound note. One hundred pounds (or any other “round sum”) quietly
handed over as payment for services performed is curiously termed “a
COOL hundred.” Thus ends, with several omissions, this long list of
Slang terms for the coins of the realm, which for copiousness, I will
engage to say, is not equalled by any other vulgar or unauthorised
language in Europe.

The antiquity of many of these Slang names is remarkable. WINN was the
vulgar term for a penny in the days of Queen Elizabeth; and TESTER, a
sixpence (formerly a shilling), was the correct name in the days of
Henry the Eighth. The reader, too, will have remarked the frequency of
animals’ names as Slang terms for money. Little, as a modern writer has
remarked, do the persons using these phrases know of their remote and
somewhat classical origin, which may, indeed, be traced to the period
antecedent to that when monarchs monopolised the surface of coined
money with their own image and superscriptions. They are identical with
the very name of money among the early Romans, which was _pecunia_,
from _pecus_, a flock. The collections of coin dealers amply show that
the figure of a HOG was anciently placed on a small silver coin; and
that that of a BULL decorated larger ones of the same metal. These
coins were frequently deeply crossed on the reverse; this was for the
convenience of easily breaking them into two or more pieces, should
the bargain for which they were employed require it, and the parties
making it had no smaller change handy to complete the transaction.
Thus we find that the HALF BULL of the itinerant street seller, or
“traveller,”[55] so far from being a phrase of modern invention, as is
generally supposed, is in point of fact referable to an era extremely
remote. There are many other Cant words directly from a classic source,
as will be seen in the Dictionary.

_Shopkeepers’ Slang_ is, perhaps, the most offensive of all Slang.
It is not a casual eyesore, as newspaper Slang, neither is it an
occasional discomfort to the ear, as in the case of some vulgar
byeword of the street; but it is a perpetual nuisance, and stares you
in the face on tradesmen’s invoices, on labels in the shop-windows,
and placards on the hoardings, in posters against the house next to
your own door—if it happens to be empty for a few weeks,—and in bills
thrust into your hand, as you peaceably walk through the streets. Under
your doors, and down your area, Slang hand-bills are dropped by some
PUSHING tradesman, and for the thousandth time you are called upon to
learn that an ALARMING SACRIFICE is taking place in the next street,
that prices are DOWN AGAIN, that in consequence of some other tradesman
not DRIVING a ROARING TRADE, being in fact SOLD UP, and for the time
being a resident in BURDON’S HOTEL (Whitecross-street Prison), the
PUSHING tradesman wishes to sell out at AWFULLY LOW PRICES, “to the
kind patrons, and numerous customers,” &c. &c., “that have on every
occasion,” &c. &c. In this Slang any occupation or calling is termed
a LINE,—thus the “Building-LINE.” A tailor usurps to himself a good
deal of Slang. Amongst operatives he is called a SNIP, or a STEEL
BAR DRIVER; by the world, a NINTH PART OF A MAN; and by the young
collegian, or “fast” man, a SUFFERER. If he takes army contracts, it
is SANK WORK; if he is a SLOP tailor, he is a SPRINGER UP, and his
garments are BLOWN TOGETHER. Perquisites with him are SPIFFS, and
remnants of cloth, PEAKING. The percentage he allows to his assistants
(or COUNTER JUMPERS) on the sale of old-fashioned articles, is termed
TINGE. If he pays his workmen in goods, or gives them tickets upon
other tradesmen, with whom he shares the profit, he is soon known as
a TOMMY MASTER. If his business succeeds, it TAKES; if neglected, it
becomes SHAKY, and GOES TO POT; if he is deceived by a creditor (a not
by any means unusual circumstance) he is LET IN, or, as it is sometimes
varied, TAKEN IN. I need scarcely remark that any credit he may give is
termed TICK.

_Operatives’ or Workmen’s Slang_, in quality, is but slightly removed
from tradesmen’s Slang. When belonging to the same shop or factory,
they GRAFT there, and are BROTHER CHIPS. They generally dine at SLAP
BANG SHOPS, and are often paid at TOMMY SHOPS. At the nearest PUB, or
public-house, they generally have a SCORE CHALKED UP against them,
which has to be WIPED OFF regularly on the Saturday night. When out
of work, they borrow a word from the flunkey vocabulary, and describe
themselves as being OUT OF COLLAR. They term each other FLINTS and
DUNGS, if they are “society” or “non-society” men. Their salary is
a SCREW, and to be discharged is to GET THE SACK. When they quit
work, they KNOCK OFF; and when out of employ, they ask if any HANDS
are wanted. FAT is the vulgar synonyme for perquisites; ELBOW-GREASE
signifies labour; and SAINT MONDAY is the favourite day of the week.
Names of animals figure plentifully in the workman’s vocabulary; thus
we have GOOSE, a tailor’s smoothing iron; SHEEP’S-FOOT, an iron hammer;
SOW, a receptacle for molten iron, whilst the metal poured from it is
termed PIG. I have often thought that many of the Slang terms for money
originally came from the workshop, thus—BRADS, from the ironmonger;
CHIPS, from the carpenter; DUST, from the goldsmith; FEATHERS, from
the upholsterer; HORSE NAILS, from the farrier; HADDOCK, from the
fishmonger; and TANNER, from the leather-dresser. The subject is
curious. Allow me to call the attention of numismatists to it.

There yet remain several distinct divisions of Slang to be
examined;—the Slang of the _stable_, or _jockey_ Slang; the Slang of
the _prize ring_; the Slang of _servitude_, or _flunkeydom_; vulgar,
or _street_ Slang; the Slang of _softened oaths_; and the Slang of
_intoxication_. I shall only examine the last two. If society, as has
been remarked, is a sham, from the vulgar foundation of commonalty to
the crowning summit of royalty, especially do we perceive the justness
of the remark in the Slang makeshifts for oaths, and sham exclamations
for passion and temper. These apologies for feeling are a disgrace to
our vernacular, although it is some satisfaction to know that they
serve the purpose of reducing the stock of national profanity. “You BE
BLOWED,” or “I’ll BE BLOWED IF,” &c., is an exclamation often heard in
the streets. BLAZES, or “like BLAZES,” came probably from the army.
BLAST, too, although in general vulgar use, may have had a like origin;
so may the phrase, “I wish I may be SHOT, if,” &c. BLOW ME TIGHT, is a
very windy and common exclamation. The same may be said of STRIKE ME
LUCKY, NEVER TRUST ME, and SO HELP ME DAVY; the latter derived from the
truer old phrase, I’LL TAKE MY DAVY ON’T, _i.e._, my _affidavit_, DAVY
being a corruption of that word. BY GOLLY, GOL DARN IT, and SO HELP ME
BOB, are evident shams for profane oaths. NATION is but a softening
of _damnation_; and OD, whether used in OD DRAT IT, or OD’S BLOOD, is
but an apology for the name of the Deity. The Irish phrase, BAD SCRAN
TO YER! is equivalent to wishing a person bad food. “I’m SNIGGERED
if you will,” and “I’m JIGGERED,” are other stupid forms of mild
swearing,—fearful of committing an open profanity, yet slyly nibbling
at the sin. Both DEUCE and DICKENS are vulgar old synonymes for the
devil; and ZOUNDS is an abbreviation of GOD’S WOUNDS,—a very ancient
catholic oath.

In a casual survey of the territory of Slang, it is curious to observe
how well represented are the familiar wants and failings of life.
First, there’s money, with one hundred and twenty Slang terms and
synonymes; then comes drink, from small beer to champagne; and next,
as a very natural sequence, _intoxication_, and fuddlement generally,
with some half a hundred vulgar terms, graduating the scale of
drunkenness from a slight inebriation, to the soaky state of gutterdom
and stretcherdom,—I pray the reader to forgive the expressions. The
Slang synonymes for mild intoxication are certainly very choice,—they
are BEERY, BEMUSED, BOOZY, BOSKY, BUFFY, CORNED, FOGGY, FOU, FRESH,
HAZY, ELEVATED, KISKY, LUSHY, MOONY, MUGGY, MUZZY, ON, SCREWED, STEWED,
TIGHT, and WINEY. A higher or more intense state of beastliness is
represented by the expressions, PODGY, BEARGERED, BLUED, CUT, PRIMED,
LUMPY, PLOUGHED, MUDDLED, OBFUSCATED, SWIPEY, THREE SHEETS IN THE WIND,
and TOP-HEAVY. But the climax of fuddlement is only obtained when the
DISGUISED individual CAN’T SEE A HOLE IN A LADDER, or when he is all
MOPS AND BROOMS, or OFF HIS NUT, or with his MAIN-BRACE WELL SPLICED,
or with the SUN IN HIS EYES, or when he has LAPPED THE GUTTER, and
got the GRAVEL RASH, or on the RAN-TAN, or on the RE-RAW, or when he
is SEWED UP, or regularly SCAMMERED,—then, and not till then, is he
entitled in vulgar society to the title of LUSHINGTON, or recommended
to PUT IN THE PIN.




A DICTIONARY OF MODERN SLANG, CANT, & VULGAR WORDS;

MANY WITH THEIR ETYMOLOGIES TRACED.


A 1, first rate, the very best; “she’s a prime girl she is; she is
A 1.“—_Sam Slick._ The highest classification of ships at Lloyd’s;
common term in the United States, also at Liverpool and other English
seaports. Another, even more intensitive form, is “first-class, letter
A, No. 1.”

ABOUT RIGHT, “to do the thing ABOUT RIGHT,” _i.e._, to do it properly,
soundly, correctly; “he guv it ’im ABOUT RIGHT,” _i.e._, he beat him
severely.

ABRAM-SHAM, or SHAM-ABRAHAM, to feign sickness or distress. From
ABRAM MAN, the _ancient cant_ term for a begging impostor, or one who
pretended to have been mad.—_Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy_, part i.,
sec. 2, vol. i., p. 360. When Abraham Newland was Cashier of the Bank
of England, and signed their notes, it was sung:—

        “I have heard people say
        That SHAM ABRAHAM you may,
  But you mustn’t SHAM ABRAHAM Newland.”

ABSQUATULATE, to run away, or abscond; a hybrid _American_ expression,
from the Latin _ab_, and “squat,” to settle.

ADAM’S ALE, water.—_English._ The Scotch term is ADAM’S WINE.

AGGERAWATORS (corruption of _Aggravators_), the greasy locks of hair in
vogue among costermongers and other street folk, worn twisted from the
temple back towards the ear. They are also, from a supposed resemblance
in form, termed NEWGATE KNOCKERS, which see.—_Sala’s Gas-light_, &c.

ALDERMAN, a half-crown—possibly from its rotundity.

ALDERMAN, a turkey.

ALDERMAN IN CHAINS, a turkey hung with sausages.

ALL OF A HUGH! all on one side, or with a thump; the word HUGH being
pronounced with a grunt.—_Suffolk._

ALL MY EYE, answer of astonishment to an improbable story; ALL MY EYE
AND BETTY MARTIN, a vulgar phrase with similar meaning, said to be
the commencement of a Popish prayer to St. Martin, “Oh mihi, beate
Martine,” and fallen into discredit at the Reformation.

ALL-OVERISH, neither sick nor well, the premonitory symptoms of illness.

ALL-ROUNDERS, the fashionable shirt collars of the present time worn
meeting in front.

ALL-SERENE, an ejaculation of acquiescence.

ALLS, tap-droppings, refuse spirits sold at a cheap rate in
gin-palaces.—_See_ LOVEAGE.

ALL-THERE, in strict fashion, first-rate, “up to the mark;” a vulgar
person would speak of a spruce, showily-dressed female as being
ALL-THERE. An artizan would use the same phrase to express the
capabilities of a skilful fellow workman.

ALL TO PIECES, utterly, excessively; “he beat him ALL TO PIECES,”
_i.e._, excelled or surpassed him exceedingly.

ALL TO SMASH, or GONE TO PIECES, bankrupt, or smashed to
pieces.—_Somersetshire._

ALMIGHTY DOLLAR, an _American_ expression for the “power of money,”
first introduced by Washington Irving in 1837.

AN’T, or AÏN’T, the vulgar abbreviation of “am not,” or “are not.”

ANOINTING, a good beating.

ANY HOW, in any way, or at any rate, bad; “he went on ANY HOW,” _i.e._,
badly or indifferently.

APPLE CART, “down with his APPLE CART,” _i.e._, upset him.—_North._

APPLE PIE ORDER, in exact or very nice order.

AREA-SNEAK, a boy thief who commits depredations upon kitchens and
cellars.—_See_ CROW.

ARGOT, a term used amongst London thieves for their secret or cant
language. _French_ term for slang.

ARY, corruption of ever a, e’er a; ARY ONE, e’er a one.

ATTACK, to carve, or commence operations on; “ATTACK that beef, and

ATTIC, the head; “queer in the ATTIC,” intoxicated.—_Pugilistic._

AUNT-SALLY, a favourite game on race-courses and at fairs, consisting
of a wooden head mounted on a stick, firmly fixed in the ground; in
the nose of which, or rather in that part of the facial arrangement of
AUNT SALLY which is generally considered incomplete without a nasal
projection, a tobacco pipe is inserted. The fun consists in standing at
a distance and demolishing AUNT SALLY’S pipe-clay projection with short
bludgeons, very similar to the half of a broom-handle. The Duke of
Beaufort is a “crack hand” at smashing pipe noses, and his performances
two years ago on Brighton race-course are yet fresh in remembrance. The
noble Duke, in the summer months, frequently drives the old London and
Brighton four-horse mail coach, “Age”—a whim singular enough now, but
common forty years ago.

AUTUMN, a slang term for an execution by hanging. When the drop was
introduced instead of the old gallows, cart, and ladder, and a man was
for the first time “turned-off” in the present fashion, the mob were
so pleased with the invention that they spoke of the operation as at
AUTUMN, or the FALL OF THE LEAF (_sc._ the drop), with the man about to
be hung.

AVAST, a sailor’s phrase for stop, shut up, go away,—apparently
connected with the _old cant_, BYNGE A WASTE.

AWAKE, or FLY, knowing, thoroughly understanding, not ignorant of. The
phrase WIDE AWAKE carries the same meaning in ordinary conversation.

AWFUL (or, with the Cockneys, ORFUL), a senseless expletive, used to
intensify a description of anything good or bad; “what an AWFUL fine
woman!” _i.e._, how handsome, or showy!

AXE, to ask.—_Saxon_, ACSIAN.

BABES, the lowest order of KNOCK-OUTS (which see), who are prevailed
upon not to give opposing biddings at auctions, in consideration of
their receiving a small sum (from one shilling to half-a-crown), and a
certain quantity of beer. BABES exist in Baltimore, U.S., where they
are known as blackguards and “rowdies.”

BAD, “to go to the BAD,” to deteriorate in character, be ruined.
_Virgil_ has an exactly similar phrase, _in pejus ruere_.

BAGMAN, a commercial traveller.

BAGS, trowsers. Trowsers of an extensive pattern, or exaggerated
fashionable cut, have lately been termed HOWLING-BAGS, but only when
the style has been very “_loud_.” The word is probably an abbreviation
for b—mbags. “To have the BAGS off,” to be of age and one’s own master,
to have plenty of money.

BAKE, “he’s only HALF BAKED,” _i.e._, soft, inexperienced.

BAKER’S DOZEN. This consists of thirteen or fourteen; the surplus
number, called the _inbread_, being thrown in for fear of incurring the
penalty for short weight. To “give a man a BAKER’S DOZEN,” in a slang
sense, means to give him an extra good beating or pummelling.

BALAAM, printers’ slang for matter kept in type about monstrous
productions of nature, &c., to fill up spaces in newspapers that

BAMBOOZLE, to deceive, make fun of, or cheat a person; abbreviated
to BAM, which is used also as a substantive, a deception, a sham, a
“sell.” _Swift_ says BAMBOOZLE was invented by a nobleman in the reign
of Charles II.; but this I conceive to be an error. The probability is
that a nobleman first _used_ it in polite society. The term is derived
from the _Gipseys_.

BANDED, hungry.

BANDY, or CRIPPLE, a sixpence, so called from this coin being generally
bent or crooked; old term for flimsy or bad cloth, temp. Q. Elizabeth.

BANG-UP, first-rate.

BANTLING, a child; stated in _Bacchus and Venus_, 1737, and by _Grose_,
to be a cant term.

BANYAN-DAY, a day on which no meat is served out for rations; probably
derived from the BANIANS, a Hindoo caste, who abstain from animal
food.—_Sea._

BAR, or BARRING, excepting; in common use in the betting-ring; “I bet
against the field BAR two.” The Irish use of BARRIN’ is very similar.

BARKER, a man employed to cry at the doors of “gaffs,” shows, and
puffing shops, to entice people inside.

BARKING IRONS, pistols.

BARNACLES, a pair of spectacles; corruption of BINOCULI?

taste.—_Theatrical._

BARRIKIN,” _i.e._, we don’t understand what he says. _Miege_ calls it
“a sort of stuff.”

BASH, to beat, thrash; “BASHING a donna,” beating a woman; originally a
provincial word, and chiefly applied to the practice of beating walnut
trees, when in bud, with long poles, to increase their productiveness.
Hence the West country proverb—

  “A woman, a whelp, and a walnut tree,
  The more you BASH ’em, the better they be.”

BAT, “on his own BAT,” on his own account.—_See_ HOOK.

remanded. _Ancient cant_, BECK. _Saxon_, BEAG, a necklace or gold
collar—emblem of authority. Sir John Fielding was called the BLIND-BEAK
in the last century Query, if connected with the Italian BECCO, which
means a (bird’s) _beak_, and also a _blockhead_.

BEAKER-HUNTER, a stealer of poultry.

BEANS, money; “a haddock of BEANS,” a purse of money; formerly BEAN
meant a guinea; _French_, BIENS, property; also used as a synonyme for
BRICK, which see.

BEAR, one who contracts to deliver or sell a certain quantity of stock
in the public funds on a forthcoming day at a stated place, but who
does not possess it, trusting to a decline in public securities to
enable him to fulfil the agreement and realise a profit.—_See_ BULL.
Both words are slang terms on the Stock Exchange, and are frequently
used in the business columns of newspapers.

  “He who sells that of which he is not possessed is proverbially said
  to sell the skin before he has caught the BEAR. It was the practice
  of stock-jobbers, in the year 1720, to enter into a contract for
  transferring South Sea Stock at a future time for a certain price;
  but he who contracted to sell had frequently no stock to transfer,
  nor did he who bought intend to receive any in consequence of his
  bargain; the seller was, therefore, called a BEAR, in allusion to the
  proverb, and the buyer a BULL, perhaps only as a similar distinction.
  The contract was merely a wager, to be determined by the rise or fall
  of stock; if it rose, the seller paid the difference to the buyer,
  proportioned to the sum determined by the same computation to the
  seller.”—_Dr. Warton on Pope._

BEAT, or BEAT-HOLLOW, to surpass or excel.

BEAT, the allotted range traversed by a policeman on duty.

BED-POST, “in the twinkling of a BED-POST,” in a moment, or very

very celebrated, especially those of Toledo, Bilboa, &c.

the streets, where it is very general. _Gothic_, BILAICAN.

BILK, to defraud, or obtain goods, &c. without paying for them; “to
BILK the schoolmaster,” to get information or experience without paying
for it.

BILLINGSGATE (when applied to speech), foul and coarse language.
Not many years since, one of the London notorieties was to hear the
fishwomen at Billingsgate abuse each other. The anecdote of Dr. Johnson
and the Billingsgate virago is well known.

BILLY, a silk pocket handkerchief.—_Scotch._—See WIPE.

⁂ A list of the slang terms descriptive of the various patterns of
handkerchiefs, pocket and neck, is here subjoined:—

  pugilist.

SALTIMBANCO,—so called from the hero of a slang song.—_Bulwer’s Paul
Clifford._

BILLY-HUNTING, buying old metal.

BIRD-CAGE, a four-wheeled cab.

Originally a Gipsey term.—_See Bacchus and Venus._

BIVVY, or GATTER, beer; “shant of BIVVY,” a pot, or quart of beer. In
Suffolk, the afternoon refreshment of reapers is called BEVER. It is
also an old English term.

  “He is none of those same ordinary eaters, that will devour three
  breakfasts, and as many dinners, without any prejudice to their
  BEVERS, drinkings, or suppers.”—_Beaumont and Fletcher’s Woman Hater_
  1–3.

Both words are probably from the Italian, _bevere_, _bere_. Latin,
_bibere_. English, _beverage_.

BLACKBERRY-SWAGGER, a person who hawks tapes, boot laces, &c.

BLACK-LEG, a rascal, swindler, or card cheat.

BLACK-STRAP, port wine.

BLADE, a man—in ancient times the term for a soldier; “knowing BLADE,”
a wide awake, sharp, or cunning man.

BLACKGUARD, a low, or dirty fellow.

  “A cant word amongst the vulgar, by which is implied a dirty fellow
  of the meanest kind, Dr. Johnson says, and he cites only the modern
  authority of Swift. But the introduction of this word into our
  language belongs not to the vulgar, and is more than a century prior
  to the time of Swift. Mr. Malone agrees with me in exhibiting the
  two first of the following examples. The _black-guard_ is evidently
  designed to imply a fit attendant on the devil. Mr. Gifford, however,
  in his late edition of Ben Jonson’s works, assigns an origin of the
  name different from what the old examples which I have cited seem
  to countenance. It has been formed, he says, from those ‘mean and
  dirty dependants, in great houses, who were selected to carry coals
  to the kitchen, halls, &c. To this smutty regiment, who attended
  the progresses, and rode in the carts with the pots and kettles,
  which, with every other article of furniture, were then moved from
  palace to palace, the people, in derision, gave the name of _black
  guards_; a term since become sufficiently familiar, and never
  properly explained.’—Ben Jonson, ii. 169, vii. 250”—_Todd’s Johnson’s
  Dictionary._

BLARNEY, flattery, exaggeration.—_Hibernicism._

BLAST, to curse.

BLAZES, “like BLAZES,” furious or desperate, a low comparison.

BLEED, to victimise, or extract money from a person, to spunge on, to
make suffer vindictively.

BLEW, or BLOW, to inform, or peach.

BLEWED, got rid of, disposed of, spent; “I BLEWED all my blunt last
night,” I spent all my money.

BLIND, a pretence, or make believe.

BLIND-HOOKEY, a gambling game at cards.

BLINKER, a blackened eye.—_Norwich slang._

BLINK FENCER, a person who sells spectacles.

_i.e._, the Judge. _Gipsey_ and _Hindoo_, LOKE. _North_, BLOACHER, any
large animal.

BLOB (from BLAB), to talk. Beggars are of two kinds,—those who SCREEVE
(introduce themselves with a FAKEMENT, or false document), and those
who BLOB, or state their case in their own truly “unvarnished” language.

BLOCK, the head.

BLOCK ORNAMENTS, the small dark coloured pieces of meat exposed on the
cheap butchers’ blocks or counters,—debateable points to all the sharp
visaged argumentative old women in low neighbourhoods.

BLOOD, a fast or high-mettled man. Nearly obsolete in the sense in
which it was used in George the Fourth’s time.

BLOOD-RED FANCY, a kind of handkerchief worn by pugilists and
frequenters of prize fights.—_See_ BILLY.

BLOODY-JEMMY, a sheep’s head.—_See_ SANGUINARY JAMES.

person. In _America_, to BLOW is slang for to taunt.

BLOW A CLOUD, to smoke a cigar or pipe—a phrase in use two centuries
ago.

BLOW ME, or BLOW ME TIGHT, a vow, a ridiculous and unmeaning
ejaculation, inferring an appeal to the ejaculator; “I’m BLOWED if you
will” is a common expression among the lower orders; “BLOW ME UP” was
the term a century ago.—_See Parker’s Adventures_, 1781.

BLOW OUT, or TUCK IN, a feast.

BLOW UP, to make a noise, or scold; formerly a cant expression used
amongst thieves, now a recognised and respectable phrase. BLOWING UP, a
jobation, a scolding.

BLOWEN, a showy or flaunting prostitute, a thief’s paramour. In
_Wilts_, a BLOWEN is a blossom. _Germ._ BLUHEN, to bloom.

  “O du _blühende_ Mädchen viel schöne Willkomm!”—_German Song._

Possibly, however, the street term BLOWEN may mean one whose reputation
has been BLOWN UPON, or damaged.

BLOWER, a girl; a contemptuous name in opposition to JOMER.

BLUBBER, to cry in a childish manner.—_Ancient._

used at prize fights. Before a SET TO, it is common to take it from the
neck and tie it round the leg as a garter, or round the waist, to “keep
in the wind.” Also, the refuse ammoniacal lime from gas factories.

BLUE BLANKET, a rough over coat made of coarse pilot cloth.

BLUE-BOTTLE, a policeman. It is singular that this well known slang
term for a London constable should have been used by Shakespere. In
part ii. of King Henry IV., act v., scene 4, Doll Tearsheet calls the
beadle, who is dragging her in, a “thin man in a censer, a BLUE-BOTTLE
rogue.”

BLUED, or BLEWED, tipsey or drunk.

BLUEY, lead. _German_, BLEI.

BLUFF, an excuse.

BLUFF, to turn aside, stop, or excuse.

BLUNT, money. It has been said that this term is from the _French_
BLOND, sandy or golden colour, and that a parallel may be found in
BROWN or BROWNS, the slang for half-pence. The etymology seems far
fetched, however.

BLURT OUT, to speak from impulse, and without reflection.—_Shakespere._

BOB, a shilling. Formerly BOBSTICK, which may have been the original.

BOB, “s’help my BOB,” a street oath, equivalent to “so help me God.”
Other words are used in street language for a similarly evasive
purpose, _i.e._, CAT, GREENS, TATUR, &c., all equally profane and
disgusting.

BOBBISH, very well, clever, spruce; “how are you doing?” “oh! pretty
BOBBISH.”—_Old._

BOBBY, a policeman. Both BOBBY and PEELER were nicknames given to the
new police, in allusion to the christian and surnames of the late _Sir
Robert Peel_, who was the prime mover in effecting their introduction
and improvement. The term BOBBY is, however, older than the _Saturday
Reviewer_, in his childish and petulant remarks, imagines. The official
square-keeper, who is always armed with a cane to drive away idle
and disorderly urchins, has, time out of mind, been called by the
said urchins, BOBBY _the Beadle_. BOBBY is also, I may remark, an
old English word for striking or hitting, a quality not unknown to
policemen.—_See Halliwell’s Dictionary._

BODMINTON, blood.—_Pugilistic._

BODY-SNATCHERS, bailiffs and runners: SNATCH, the trick by which the
bailiff captures the delinquent.

BODY-SNATCHERS, cat stealers.

BOG or BOG-HOUSE, a water-closet.—_School term._ In the Inns of Court,
I am informed, this term is very common.

BOG-TROTTER, satirical name for an Irishman.—_Miege._ _Camden_,
however, speaking of the “debateable land” on the borders of England
and Scotland, says “both these dales breed notable BOG-TROTTERS.”

BOILERS, the slang name given to the New Kensington Museum and School
of Art, in allusion to the peculiar form of the buildings, and the fact
of their being mainly composed of, and covered with, sheet iron.—_See_
PEPPER-BOXES.

BOLT, to run away, decamp, or abscond.

BOLT, to swallow without chewing.

BONE, good, excellent. ◇ the vagabond’s hieroglyphic for BONE, or good,
chalked by them on houses and street corners, as a hint to succeeding
beggars. _French_, BON.

BONE, to steal or pilfer. BONED, seized, apprehended.—_Old._

BONE-GRUBBERS, persons who hunt dust-holes, gutters, and all likely
spots for refuse bones, which they sell at the rag-shops, or to the
bone-grinders.

BONE-PICKER, a footman.

BONES, dice; also called ST. HUGH’S BONES.

BONES, “he made no BONES of it,” he did not hesitate, _i.e._, undertook
and finished the work without difficulty, “found no BONES in the
jelly.”—_Ancient, vide Cotgrave._

BONNET, a gambling cheat. “A man who sits at a gaming-table, and
appears to be playing against the table; when a stranger enters, the
BONNET generally wins.”—_Times_, Nov. 17, 1856. Also, a pretence, or
make-believe, a sham bidder at auctions.

BONNET, to strike a man’s cap or hat over his eyes and nose.

BONNETTER, one who induces another to gamble.

BOOK, an arrangement of bets for and against, chronicled in a
pocket-book made for that purpose; “making a BOOK upon it,” common
phrase to denote the general arrangement of a person’s bets on a race.
“That does not suit my BOOK,” _i.e._, does not accord with my other
arrangements. _Shakespere_ uses BOOK in the sense of “a paper of
conditions.”

BOOM, “to tip one’s BOOM off,” to be off, or start in a certain
direction.—_Sea._

BOOKED, caught, fixed, disposed of.—Term in _Book-keeping_.

BOOZE, drink. _Ancient cant_, BOWSE.

BOOZE, to drink, or more properly, to use another slang term, to
“lush,” viz, to drink continually, until drunk, or nearly so. The term
is an old one. Harman, in Queen Elizabeth’s days, speaks of “BOUSING
(or boozing) and belly-cheere.” The term was good English in the
fourteenth century, and comes from the Dutch, BUYZEN, to tipple.

BOOZE, or SUCK-CASA, a public-house.

BOOZING-KEN, a beer-shop, a low public house.—_Ancient._

BOOZY, intoxicated or fuddled.

BORE, a troublesome friend or acquaintance, a nuisance, anything which
wearies or annoys. The _Gradus ad Cantabrigiam_ suggests the derivation
of BORE from the _Greek_, Βαρος, a burden. _Shakespere_ uses it, King
Henry VIII., i., 1—

    “—— at this instant
  He BORES me with some trick.”

_Grose_ speaks of this word as being much in fashion about the year
1780–81, and states that it vanished of a sudden, without leaving a
trace behind. Not so, burly Grose, the term is still in favour, and
is as piquant and expressive as ever. Of the modern sense of the word
BORE, the Prince Consort made an amusing and effective use in his
masterly address to the British Association, at Aberdeen, September 14,
1859. He said (as reported by the _Times_):—

  “I will not weary you by further examples, with which most of
  you are better acquainted than I am myself but merely express my
  satisfaction that there should exist bodies of men who will bring the
  well-considered and understood wants of science before the public and
  the Government, who will even hand round the begging-box, and expose
  themselves to refusals and rebuffs, to which all beggars all liable,
  with the certainty besides of being considered great BORES. Please
  to recollect that this species of “bore” is a most useful animal,
  well adapted for the ends for which nature intended him. He alone, by
  constantly returning to the charge, and repeating the same truths and
  the same requests, succeeds in awakening attention to the cause which
  he advocates, and obtains that hearing which is granted him at last
  for self-protection, as the minor evil compared to his importunity,
  but which is requisite to make his cause understood.”

BOSH, nonsense, stupidity.—_Gipsey_ and _Persian_. Also pure _Turkish_,
BOSH LAKERDI, empty talk. A person, in the _Saturday Review_, has
stated that BOSH is coeval with Morier’s novel, _Hadji Babi_, which was
published in 1828; but this is a blunder. The term was used in this
country as early as 1760, and may be found in the _Student_, vol. ii.,
p. 217.

BOSH, a fiddle.

BOSH-FAKER, a violin player.

BOS-KEN, a farm-house. _Ancient._—_See_ KEN.

BOSKY, inebriated—_Household Words_, No. 183.

BOSMAN, a farmer; “faking a BOSMAN on the main toby,” robbing a farmer
on the highway. BOSS, a master.—_American._ Both terms from the
_Dutch_, BOSCH-MAN, one who lives in the woods; otherwise _Boschjeman_
or _Bushman_.

BOSS-EYED, a person with one eye, or rather with one eye injured.

BOTHER, to teaze, to annoy.

BOTHER (from the _Hibernicism_ POTHER), trouble, or annoyance. _Grose_
has a singular derivation, BOTHER, or BOTH-EARED, from two persons
talking at the same time, or to both ears. BLOTHER, an old word,
signifying to chatter idly.—_See Halliwell._

BOTHERATION! trouble, annoyance; “BOTHERATION to it,” confound it, or
deuce take it, an exclamation when irritated.

BOUNETTER, a fortune-telling cheat.—_Gipsey._

BOW-CATCHERS, or KISS-CURLS, small curls twisted on the cheeks or
temples of young—and often old—girls, adhering to the face as if gummed
or pasted. Evidently a corruption of BEAU-CATCHERS. In old times these
were called _love-locks_, when they were the marks at which all the
puritan and ranting preachers levelled their pulpit pop-guns, loaded
with sharp and virulent abuse. Hall and Prynne looked upon all women as
strumpets who dared to let the hair depart from a straight line upon
their cheeks. The French prettily term them _accroche-cœurs_, whilst in
the United States they are plainly and unpleasantly called SPIT-CURLS.
Bartlett says:—“SPIT CURL, a detached lock of hair curled upon the
temple; probably from having been at first plastered into shape by the
saliva. It is now understood that the mucilage of quince seed is used
by the ladies for this purpose.”

  “You may prate of your lips, and your teeth of pearl,
    And your eyes so brightly flashing;
  My song shall be of that SALIVA CURL
    Which threatens my heart to smash in.”

  _Boston Transcript_, October 30, 1858.

When men twist the hair on each side of their faces into ropes they are
sometimes called BELL-ROPES, as being wherewith to _draw the belles_.
Whether BELL-ROPES or BOW-CATCHERS, it is singular they should form
part of the prisoner’s paraphernalia, and that a jaunty little kiss-me
quick curl should, of all things in the world, ornament a gaol dock;
yet such was formerly the case. Hunt, the murderer of Weare, on his
trial, we are informed by the Athenæum, appeared at the bar with a
highly pomatumed love-lock sticking tight to his forehead. Young
ladies, think of this!

HIS LEGS,” _i.e._, got drunk. In the ancient Egyptian language the
determinative character in the hieroglyphic verb “to be drunk,” has
the significant form of the leg of a man being amputated. [Egyptian
hieroglyphs]

BREECHED, or TO HAVE THE BAGS OFF, to have plenty of money; “to be well
BREECHED,” to be in good circumstances.

  And taught them to eschew all their addresses to the Queen.
  If again they try it on, why to floor them I’ll make one,
  Spite of Peeler or of Don, like a BRICK and a _Bean_.”

BROSIER, a bankrupt.—_Cheshire._ BROSIER-MY-DAME, school term, implying
a clearing of the housekeeper’s larder of provisions, in revenge for
stinginess.—_Eton._

BROTHER-CHIP, fellow carpenter. Also, BROTHER-WHIP, a fellow coachman;
and BROTHER-BLADE, of the same occupation or calling—originally a
fellow soldier.

BROWN, a halfpenny.—_See_ BLUNT.

roasting); “doing it BROWN,” prolonging the frolic, or exceeding sober
bounds; “DONE BROWN,” taken in, deceived, or surprised.

BROWN BESS, the old Government regulation musket.

BROWN PAPERMEN, low gamblers.

BROWN SALVE, a token of surprise at what is heard, and at the same time
means “I understand you.”

BROWN-STUDY, a reverie. Very common even in educated society, but
hardly admissible in writing, and therefore must be considered a
vulgarism. It is derived, by a writer in _Notes and Queries_, from
BROW study, from the old German BRAUN, or AUG-BRAUN, an eye-brow.—_Ben
Jonson._

BROWN-TO, to understand, to comprehend.—_American._

BRUISER, a fighting man, a pugilist.—_Pugilistic._ _Shakespere_ uses
the word BRUISING in a similar sense.

(Bromwicham), the ancient name of _Birmingham_, the great emporium of
plated goods and imitation jewellery.

BRUSH, or BRUSH-OFF, to run away, or move on.—_Old cant._

BUCKHORSE, a smart blow or box on the ear; derived from the name of a
celebrated “bruiser” of that name.

BUCKLE, to bend; “I can’t BUCKLE to that,” I don’t understand it; to
yield or give in to a person. _Shakespere_ uses the word in the latter
sense, Henry IV., i. 1; and _Halliwell_ says that “the commentators
do not supply another example.” How strange that in our own streets
the term should be used every day! Stop the first costermonger, and he
will soon inform you the various meanings of BUCKLE.—_See Notes and
Queries_, vols. vii., viii., and ix.

BUCKLE-TO, to bend to one’s work, to begin at once, and with great
energy.

BUDGE, to move, to inform, to SPLIT, or tell tales.

BUFF, to swear to, or accuse; to SPLIT, or peach upon. _Old_ word for
boasting, 1582.

BUFF, the bare skin; “stripped to the BUFF.”

BUFFER, a dog. Their skins were formerly in great request—hence the
term, BUFF meaning in old English _to skin_. It is still used in the
ring, BUFFED meaning stripped to the skin. In Irish cant, BUFFER is a
_boxer_. The BUFFER of a railway carriage doubtless received its very
appropriate name from the old pugilistic application of this term.

BUFFER, a familiar expression for a jolly acquaintance, probably from
the _French_, BOUFFARD, a fool or clown; a “jolly old BUFFER,” said
of a good humoured or liberal old man. In 1737, a BUFFER was a “rogue
that killed good sound horses for the sake of their skins, by running a
long wire into them.”—_Bacchus and Venus._ The term was once applied to
those who took false oaths for a consideration.

BUFFLE HEAD, a stupid or obtuse person.—_Miege._ _German_,
BUFFEL-HAUPT, buffalo-headed.

“it’s a tidy BUILD, who made it?”

BULL, term amongst prisoners for the meat served to them in jail.

BULL, one who agrees to purchase stock at a future day, at a stated
price, but who does not possess money to pay for it, trusting to a rise
in public securities to render the transaction a profitable one. Should
stocks fall, the bull is then called upon to pay the difference.—_See_
BEAR, who is the opposite of a BULL, the former selling, the latter
purchasing—the one operating for a _fall_ or a _pull down_, whilst the
other operates for a _rise_ or _toss up_.

BULL, a crown piece; formerly, BULL’S EYE.

BULL-THE-CASK, to pour hot water into an empty rum puncheon, and let it
stand until it extracts the spirit from the wood. The result is drunk
by sailors in default of something stronger.—_Sea._

BULLY, a braggart; but in the language of the streets, a man of the
most degraded morals, who protects prostitutes, and lives off their

2.

BUM, the part on which we sit.—_Shakespere._ BUMBAGS, trowsers.

BUM-BAILIFF, a sheriff’s officer,—a term, some say, derived from the
proximity which this gentleman generally maintains to his victims.
_Blackstone_ says it is a corruption of “bound bailiff.”

BUM-BOATS, shore boats which supply ships with provisions, and serve as
means of communication between the sailors and the shore.

BUM-BRUSHER, a schoolmaster.

BUMMAREE. This term is given to a class of speculating salesmen at
Billingsgate market, not recognised as such by the trade, but who
get a living by buying large quantities of fish of the salesmen and
re-selling it to smaller buyers. The word has been used in the statutes
and bye-laws of the markets for upwards of 100 years. It has been
variously derived, but is most probably from the _French_, BONNE MAREE,
good fresh fish! “Marée signifie toute sorte de poisson de mer qûi
n’est pas salé; bonne marée—_marée fraiche_, vendeur de marée.”—_Dict.
de l’Acad. Franc._ The BUMMAREES are accused of many trade tricks. One
of them is to blow up cod-fish with a pipe until they look double their
actual size. Of course when the fish come to table they are flabby,
sunken, and half dwindled away. In Norwich, TO BUMMAREE ONE is to run
up a score at a public house just open, and is equivalent to “running
into debt with one.”

BUNCH OF FIVES, the hand, or fist.

BUNDLE, “to BUNDLE a person off,” _i.e._, to pack him off, send him
flying.

to deceive one by a lie, to CRAM, which see.

BUNKER, beer.

BUNTS, costermonger’s perquisites; the money obtained by giving light
weight, &c.; costermongers’ goods sold by boys on commission. Probably
a corruption of _bonus_, BONE being the slang for good. BUNCE, _Grose_
gives as the cant word for money.

BURDON’S HOTEL, Whitecross-street prison, of which the Governor is or
was a Mr. Burdon.

BURERK, a lady. _Grose_ gives BURICK, a prostitute.

Burke, the notorious Whitechapel murderer, who with others used to
waylay people, kill them, and sell their bodies for dissection at the
hospitals.

BURYING A MOLL, running away from a mistress.

BUSKER, a man who sings or performs in a public house.—_Scotch._

the tap rooms of public houses. Sometimes implies selling any articles.

BUTTER-FINGERED, apt to let things fall.

BUTTON, a decoy, sham purchaser, &c. At any mock or sham auction seedy
specimens may be seen. Probably from the connection of _buttons_ with
_Brummagem_, which is often used as a synonyme for a sham.

BUTTONER, a man who entices another to play.—_See_ BONNETTER.

BUTTONS, a page,—from the rows of gilt buttons which adorn his jacket.

BUTTONS, “not to have all one’s BUTTONS,” to be deficient in intellect.

BUZ, to share equally the last of a bottle of wine, when there is not
enough for a full glass for each of the party.

BUZZERS, pickpockets. _Grose_ gives BUZ COVE and BUZ GLOAK, the latter
is very ancient cant.

BUZ-BLOAK, a pickpocket, who principally confines his attention to
purses and loose cash. _Grose_ gives BUZ-GLOAK (or CLOAK?), an ancient
cant word. BUZ-NAPPER, a young pickpocket.

BUZ-NAPPER’S ACADEMY, a school in which young thieves are trained.
Figures are dressed up, and experienced tutors stand in various
difficult attitudes for the boys to practice upon. When clever enough
they are sent on the streets. It is reported that a house of this
nature is situated in a court near Hatton Garden. The system is well
explained in _Dickens’ Oliver Twist_.

BYE-BLOW, a bastard child.

BY GEORGE, an exclamation similar to BY JOVE. The term is older than is
frequently imagined, vide _Bacchus and Venus_ (p. 117), 1737. “Fore (or
by) GEORGE, I’d knock him down.” A street compliment to Saint George,
the patron Saint of England, or possibly to the House of Hanover.

BY GOLLY, an ejaculation, or oath; a compromise for “by God.” In the
United States, small boys are permitted by their guardians to say
GOL DARN anything, but they are on no account allowed to commit the
profanity of G—d d——g anything. An effective ejaculation and moral
waste pipe for interior passion or wrath is seen in the exclamation—BY
THE-EVER-LIVING-JUMPING-MOSES—a harmless phrase, that from its length
expends a considerable quantity of fiery anger.

CAB, in statutory language, “a hackney carriage drawn by one horse.”
Abbreviated from CABRIOLET, _French_; originally meaning “a light low
chaise.” The wags of Paris playing upon the word (quasi _cabri_ au
lait) used to call a superior turn-out of the kind a _cabri au crême_.
Our abbreviation, which certainly smacks of slang, has been stamped
with the authority of “GEORGE, _Ranger_.” See the notices affixed to
the carriage entrances of St. James’s Park.

CAB, to stick together, to muck, or tumble up.—_Devonshire._

CABBAGE, pieces of cloth said to be purloined by tailors.

CABBAGE, to pilfer or purloin. Termed by Johnson a cant word, but
adopted by later lexicographers as a respectable term. Said to have
been first used in this sense by _Arbuthnot_.

CABBY, the driver of a cab.

CAD, or CADGER (from which it is shortened), a mean or vulgar fellow;
a beggar; one who would rather live on other people than work for
himself; a man trying to worm something out of another, either money
or information. _Johnson_ uses the word, and gives _huckster_ as the
meaning, but I never heard it used in this sense. CAGER, or GAGER, the
_old cant_ term for a man. The exclusives in the Universities apply the
term CAD to all non-members.

CAD, an omnibus conductor.

CADGE, to beg in an artful or wheedling manner.—_North._

CADGING, begging of the lowest degree.

2.

the public in different vein.

CAMESA, shirt or chemise.—_Span._ _Ancient cant_, COMMISSION.

CAMISTER, a preacher, clergyman, or master.

term, that city being famous for its breed of those birds.

CANISTER, the head.—_Pugilistic._

CANISTER-CAP, a hat.—_Pugilistic._

CANNIKEN, a small can, similar to PANNIKIN.—_Shakespere._

CANT, a blow or toss; “a cant over the kisser,” a blow on the
mouth.—_Kentish._

CANT OF TOGS, a gift of clothes.

CARDINAL, a lady’s cloak. This, I am assured, is the _Seven Dials_
cant term for a lady’s garment, but curiously enough the same name is
given to the most fashionable patterns of the article by Regent-street
drapers. A cloak with this name was in fashion in the year 1760. It
received its title from its similarity in shape to one of the vestments
of a cardinal.

CARNEY, soft talk, nonsense, gammon.—_Hibernicism._

CAROON, five shillings. _French_, COURONNE; Gipsey, COURNA,—PANSH
COURNA, half-a-crown.

CARPET, “upon the CARPET,” any subject or matter that is uppermost for
discussion or conversation. Frequently quoted as _sur le tapis_, but it
does not seem to be a correct Parisian phrase.

CARRIER PIGEONS, swindlers, who formerly used to cheat Lottery Office
Keepers. _Nearly obsolete._

CARROTS, the coarse and satirical term for red hair.

CARRY-ON, to joke a person to excess, to carry on a “spree” too far;
“how we CARRIED ON, to be sure!” _i.e._, what fun we had.

CART, a race-course.

CARTS, a pair of shoes. In Norfolk the carapace of a crab is called a
_crab cart_, hence CARTS would be synonymous with CRAB SHELLS, which
see.

CART WHEEL, a five shilling piece.

CASA, or CASE, a house, respectable or otherwise. Probably from the
_Italian_, CASA.—_Old cant._ The _Dutch_ use the word KAST in a vulgar
sense for a house, _i.e._, MOTTEKAST, a brothel. CASE sometimes means a
water-closet.

CASCADING, vomiting.

CASE, a bad crown piece. HALF-A-CASE, a counterfeit half crown. There
are two sources, either of which may have contributed this slang term.
CASER is the Hebrew word for a crown; and silver coin is frequently
counterfeited by coating or CASING pewter or iron imitations with
silver.

CASE. A few years ago the term CASE was applied to persons and things;
“what a CASE he is,” _i.e._, what a curious person; “a rum CASE that,”
or “you are a CASE,” both synonymous with the phrase “odd fish,” common
half-a-century ago. Among young ladies at boarding schools a CASE means
a love affair.

CASK, fashionable slang for a brougham, or other private
carriage.—_Household Words_, No. 183.

CASSAM, cheese—not CAFFAN, which Egan, in his edition of _Grose_, has
ridiculously inserted.—_Ancient cant._ _Latin_, CASEUS.

CASTING UP ONE’S ACCOUNTS, vomiting.—_Old._

CASTOR, a hat. CASTOR was once the ancient word for a BEAVER; and
strange to add, BEAVER was the slang for CASTOR, or hat, thirty years
ago, before gossamer came into fashion.

CAT, to vomit like a cat.—_See_ SHOOT THE CAT.

CAT, a lady’s muff; “to free a CAT,” _i.e._, steal a muff.

advantage.

the _Lingua Franca_, and _Italian_, CATTIVO, bad. Variously spelled by
the lower orders.—_See_ KERTEVER.

CAT-LAP, a contemptuous expression for weak drink.

CAT’S WATER, old Tom, or Gin.

public-houses.

CATCH-PENNY, any temporary contrivance to obtain money from the public,
penny shows, or cheap exhibitions.

is frequently turned from side to side.

CAUCUS, a private meeting held for the purpose of concerting measures,
agreeing upon candidates for office before an election, &c.—_See
Pickering’s Vocabulary._

the sinking of an abandoned mining shaft.

CHAFF, to gammon, joke, quiz, or praise ironically. CHAFF-bone, the
jaw-bone.—_Yorkshire._ CHAFF, jesting. In _Anglo Saxon_, CEAF is chaff;
and CEAFL, bill, beak, or jaw. In the “Ancien Riwle,” A.D. 1221,
_ceafle_ is used in the sense of idle discourse.

CHALK-OUT, or CHALK DOWN, to mark out a line of conduct or action; to
make a rule, order. Phrase derived from the _Workshop_.

CHALK UP, to credit, make entry in account books of indebtedness; “I
can’t pay you now, but you can CHALK IT UP,” _i.e._, charge me with the
article in your day-book. From the old practice of chalking one’s score
for drink behind the bar-doors of public houses.

CHALKS, “to walk one’s CHALKS,” to move off, or run away. An ordeal for
drunkenness used on board ship, to see whether the suspected person can

CHAUNTER-CULLS, a singular body of men who used to haunt certain well
known public-houses, and write satirical or libellous ballads on any
person, or body of persons, for a consideration. 7s. 6d. was the
usual fee, and in three hours the ballad might be heard in St. Paul’s
Churchyard, or other public spot. There are two men in London at the
present day who gain their living in this way.

CHAUNTERS, those street sellers of ballads, last copies of verses, and
other broadsheets, who sing or bawl the contents of their papers. They
often term themselves PAPER WORKERS. _A. N._—_See_ HORSE CHAUNTERS.

CHAUNT, to sing the contents of any paper in the streets. CANT, as
applied to vulgar language, was derived from CHAUNT.—_See Introduction._

CHEAP, “doing it on the CHEAP,” living economically, or keeping up a
showy appearance with very little means.

CHEAP JACKS, or JOHNS, oratorical hucksters and patterers of hardware,
&c., at fairs and races. They put an article up at a high price, and
then cheapen it by degrees, indulging in volleys of coarse wit, until
it becomes to all appearance a bargain, and as such it is bought by
one of the crowd. The popular idea is that the inverse method of
auctioneering saves them paying for the auction license.

CHEEK, share or portion; “where’s my CHEEK?” where is my allowance?

CHEEK, impudence, assurance; CHEEKY, saucy or forward. _Lincolnshire_,
CHEEK, to accuse.

confabulation as almost to have their faces touch.

CHEESE, anything good, first-rate in quality, genuine, pleasant, or
advantageous, is termed THE CHEESE. _Mayhew_ thinks CHEESE, in this
sense, is from the _Saxon_, CEOSAN, to choose, and quotes _Chaucer_,
who uses CHESE in the sense of choice. The _London Guide_, 1818, says
it was from some young fellows translating “c’est une autre CHOSE” into
“that is another CHEESE.” CHEESE is also _Gipsey_ and _Hindoo_ (_see
Introduction_); and _Persian_, CHIZ, a thing.—_See_ STILTON.

CHEESE, or CHEESE IT (evidently a corruption of _cease_), leave off, or
have done; “CHEESE your barrikin,” hold your noise.

CHEESY, fine or showy.

CHERUBS, or CHERUBIMS, the chorister boys who chaunt in the services at
the abbeys.

CHESHIRE CAT, “to grin like a CHESHIRE CAT,” to display the teeth and
gums when laughing. Formerly the phrase was “to grin like a CHESHIRE
CAT _eating_ CHEESE.” A _hardly satisfactory_ explanation has been
given of this phrase—that Cheshire is a county palatine, and the cats,
when they think of it, are so tickled with the notion that they can’t
help grinning.

CHICKEN, a young girl.

CHICKEN-HEARTED, cowardly, fearful.

CHI-IKE, a hurrah, a good word, or hearty praise.

of soft or luxurious manners. Halliwell states, in his admirable essay
upon the word, that “some writers trace the word with much probability
to the imaginary land of COCKAYGNE, the lubber land of the olden
times.” _Grose_ gives Minsheu’s absurd but comical derivation:—A
citizen of London being in the country, and hearing a horse neigh,
exclaimed, “_Lord! how that horse laughs_.” A bystander informed him

crowed, the citizen, to show that he had not forgotten what was told

taking him for a veritable coon levelled his piece at him, upon which
he exclaimed, “Don’t shoot, I’ll come down of myself, I know I’m a GONE

&c.—_Shakespere_. The immorality of _Corinth_ was proverbial in
Greece. Κορινθίαζ εσθαι, to _Corinthianise_, indulge in the company of
courtesans, was a _Greek_ slang expression. Hence the proverb—

  Οὐ παντὸς ἀνδρὸς εἰς Κόρινθον ἔσθ' ὁ πλοῦς,

with CUIF, which, in the North of England, signifies a lout or awkward
fellow. Amongst _Negroes_, CUFFEE.

COVENTRY, “to send a man to COVENTRY,” not to speak to or notice him.
Coventry was one of those towns in which the privilege of practising
most trades was anciently confined to certain privileged persons, as

countenance, and “to send a man to COVENTRY,” came to be equivalent to

“Butcher Duke” wrote a cruel order with respect to the rebels after the
battle of Culloden; that the diamonds are the nine lozenges in the arms
of Dalrymple, Earl of Stair, detested for his share in the Massacre
of Glencoe; that it is a corruption of _Cross of Scotland_, the nine

Joan the nine of diamonds is the POPE, of whom the Scotch have an
especial horror.

much from the ground.

DAISY KICKERS, the name hostlers at large inns used to give each other,
now nearly obsolete. DAISY-KICKER, or GROGHAM, was likewise the cant
term for a horse.

The DAISY-KICKERS were sad rogues in the old posting-days; frequently
the landlords rented the stables to them, as the only plan to make them
return a profit.

DANDER, passion, or temper; “to get one’s DANDER up,” to rouse his
passion.—_Old._

DANDY, a fop, or fashionable nondescript. This word, in the sense of a
fop, is of modern origin. _Egan_ says it was first used in 1820, and
_Bee_ in 1816. Johnson does not mention it, although it is to be found
in all late dictionaries. DANDIES wore stays, studied feminity, and
tried to undo their manhood. Lord Petersham headed them. At the present
day dandies of this stamp are fast disappearing. The feminine of DANDY
was DANDIZETTE, but the term only lived for a short season.

when of a poor description; “it’s all DICKEY with him,” _i.e._, all
over with him.

DICKEY, formerly the cant for a worn out shirt, but means now-a-days a
front or half-shirt. DICKEY was originally TOMMY (from the Greek, τομη,
a section), a name which I understand was formerly used in Trinity

the GYPS changed it to DICKEY, in which dress it is supposed to have
been imported into England.

DISH, to stop, to do away with, to suppress; DISHED, done for, floored,
beaten, or silenced. A correspondent suggests that meat is usually DONE
BROWN before being DISHED, and conceives that the latter term may have
arisen as the natural sequence of the former.

DISHABBILLY, the ridiculous corruption of the _French_, DESHABILLE,
amongst fashionably affected, but ignorant “stuck-up” people.

DITHERS, nervous or cold shiverings. “It gave me the DITHERS.”

DO, this useful and industrious verb has for many years done service
as a slang term. To DO a person is to cheat him. Sometimes another
tense is employed, such as “I DONE him,” meaning I cheated or “paid
him out;” DONE BROWN, cheated thoroughly, befooled; DONE OVER, upset,
cheated, knocked down, ruined; DONE UP, used up, finished, or quieted.
DONE also means convicted, or sentenced; so does DONE-FOR. To DO a
person in pugilism is to excel him in fisticuffs. Humphreys, who fought
Mendoza, a Jew, wrote this laconic note to his supporter—“Sir,—I have
DONE the Jew, and am in good health. Rich. Humphreys.” Tourists use the
expression “I have DONE France and Italy,” meaning I have completely
explored those countries.

DOCTOR, to adulterate or drug liquor; also to falsify accounts.—_See_
COOK.

DODGE, a cunning trick. “DODGE, that homely but expressive
phrase.”—_Sir Hugh Cairns on the Reform Bill_, 2nd March, 1859.
_Anglo Saxon_, DEOGIAN, to colour, to conceal. The TIDY DODGE, as it
is called by street-folk, consists in dressing up a family clean and
_tidy_, and parading the streets to excite compassion and obtain alms.
A correspondent suggests that the verb DODGE may have been formed
(like _wench_ from _wink_) from DOG, _i.e._, to double quickly and
unexpectedly, as in coursing.

DODGER, a tricky person, or one who, to use the popular phrase, “knows
too much.”—_See_ DEVIL-DODGER.

often given to the last dram at night.

dogs. The first syllable is god = _good_ transposed, and the second,
the ch—p, is chapman, _merchant_: compare EASTCHEAP.”—_Old term._

DOG-LATIN, barbarous Latin, such as was formerly used by lawyers in
their pleadings.

DOG-ON-IT, a form of mild swearing used by boys. It is just worthy of
mention that DOGONE, in _Anglo-Norman_, is equivalent to a term of
contempt. _Friesic_, DOGENIET.

DOGSNOSE, gin and beer, so called from the mixture being _cold_, like a
dog’s nose.

good enough for the pawnbroker, are received, and charged at so much
per day. If not redeemed the third day the goods are forfeited. _Anglo
Saxon_, DAEL, a part,—to dole?—_See_ NIX. A correspondent thinks it may
have been derived from the _black doll_, the usual sign of a rag shop.

DOMINE, a parson.

DOMINOS, the teeth.

DON, a clever fellow, the opposite of a muff; a person of distinction
in his line or walk. At the Universities, the Masters and Fellows are
THE DONS. DON is also used as an adjective, “a DON hand at a knife and
fork,” _i.e._, a first-rate feeder at a dinner table.—_Spanish._

DONE FOR A RAMP, convicted for thieving.

DONKEY, “three more and up goes the DONKEY,” a vulgar street phrase
for extracting as much money as possible before performing any task.
The phrase had its origin with a travelling showman, the _finale_ of
whose performance was the hoisting of a DONKEY on a pole or ladder;
but this consummation was never arrived at unless the required number
of “browns” was first paid up, and “three more” was generally the
unfortunate deficit.

DOOKIN, fortune telling. _Gipsey_, DUKKERIN.

one’s _dorsum_, back.

DOSS-KEN, a lodging house.

mouth,” disconsolate; “to be DOWN on one,” to treat him harshly or
suspiciously, to pounce upon him, or detect his tricks.

DOWN THE DOLLY, a favourite gambling contrivance, often seen in the
tap rooms of public houses, at race-courses, and fairs, consisting of
a round board and the figure of an old man or “doll,” down which is a
spiral hole. A marble is dropped “down the dolly,” and stops in one of
the small holes or pits (numbered) on the board. The bet is decided
according as the marble stops on a high or low figure.

sharper.

DOWRY, a lot, a great deal; “DOWRY of parny,” lot of rain or
water.—_See_ PARNY. Probably from the _Gipsey_.

DOXY, the female companion of a thief or beggar. In the West of
England, the women frequently call their little girls DOXIES, in
a familiar or endearing sense. A learned divine once described
_orthodoxy_ as being a man’s own DOXY, and _heterodoxy_ another man’s
DOXY.—_Ancient cant._

DRAB, a vulgar or low woman.—_Shakespere._

DRAG, a cart of any kind, a coach; gentlemen drive to the races in
drags.

sometimes called a COMMON SEWER.

customers desire the beer to be DRAWN mild.

DRAWERS, formerly the ancient cant name for very long stockings, now a
hosier’s term.

DRAWING TEETH, wrenching off knockers.

DRIVE-AT, to aim at; “what is he DRIVING AT?” “what does he intend
to imply?” a phrase often used when a circuitous line of argument
is adopted by a barrister, or a strange set of questions asked, the
purpose of which is not very evident.

DRIVE, a term used by tradesmen in speaking of business; “he’s DRIVING
a _roaring_ trade,” _i.e._, a very good one; hence, to succeed in a
bargain, “I DROVE a good bargain,” _i.e._, got the best end of it.

DRIZ, lace. In a low lodging house this singular autograph inscription
appeared over the mantelpiece, “Scotch Mary, with DRIZ (lace), bound to

DRIZ FENCER, a person who sells lace.

DROP, to quit, go off, or turn aside; “DROP the main Toby,” go off the

number of skips they make.

DUDDERS, or DUDSMEN, persons who formerly travelled the country as
pedlars, selling gown-pieces, silk waistcoats, &c., to countrymen. In
selling a waistcoat-piece for thirty shillings or two pounds, which
cost them perhaps five shillings, they would show great fear of the
revenue officer, and beg of the purchasing clodhopper _to kneel down
in a puddle of water, crook his arm, and swear that it might never
become straight if he told an exciseman, or even his own wife_. The
term and practice are nearly obsolete. In Liverpool, however, and at
the east end of London, men dressed up as sailors, with pretended silk
handkerchiefs and cigars “only just smuggled from the Indies,” are
still to be plentifully found.

DUDDS, clothes, or personal property. _Gaelic_, DUD; _Ancient cant_;
also _Dutch_.

DUFF, pudding; vulgar pronunciation of DOUGH.—_Sea._

DUFFER, a hawker of “Brummagem” or sham jewellery; a sham of any kind;
a fool, or worthless person. DUFFER was formerly synonymous with
DUDDER, and was a general term given to pedlars. It is mentioned in
the _Frauds of London_ (1760), as a word in frequent use in the last
century to express cheats of all kinds. From the _German_, DURFEN, to
want?

DUFFING, false, counterfeit, worthless.

DUKE, gin.—_Household Words_, No. 183.

satisfied with the security, down with the DUST.”

DUTCH UNCLE!” conveys the notion of anything but a desirable
relation.—_Americanism._

DOUBLE DUTCH, gibberish, or any foreign tongue.

EARL OF CORK, the ace of diamonds.—_Hibernicism._

  “What do you mean by the Earl of Cork?” asked Mr. Squander. “The ace
  of diamonds, your honour. It’s the worst ace, and the poorest card in

  nobleman in Ireland.”—_Carleton’s Traits and Stories of the Irish
  Peasantry._

ELEPHANT, “to have SEEN THE ELEPHANT,” to be “_up_ to the latest
move,” or “_down_ to the last new trick;” to be knowing, and not
“green,” &c. Possibly a metaphor taken from the travelling menageries,
where the ELEPHANT is the _finale_ of the exhibition.—Originally an
_Americanism_. _Bartlett_ gives conflicting examples. _General_ now,
however.

EVAPORATE, to go, or run away.

EVERLASTING STAIRCASE, the treadmill. Sometimes called “Colonel
Chesterton’s everlasting staircase,” from the gallant inventor or

school-mate. _Grose_ thinks FAGGED OUT is derived from this.

little FAGOT, you!” FAGOT was originally a term of contempt for a dry,
shrivelled old woman, whose bones were like a bundle of sticks, only

fagot_.

make or construct; to steal, or rob,—a verb variously used. FAKED,

prostitute is still called her FANCY-MAN.

FANCY-BLOAK, a fancy or sporting man.

FAN-TAIL, a dustman’s hat.

FAST, gay, spreeish, unsteady, thoughtless,—an Americanism that has
of late ascended from the streets to the drawing-room. The word has
certainly now a distinct meaning, which it had not thirty years ago.
QUICK is the synonyme for FAST, but a QUICK MAN would not convey
the meaning of a FAST MAN,—a person who by late hours, gaiety, and
continual rounds of pleasure, lives too fast and wears himself out. In
polite society a FAST young lady is one who affects mannish habits,
or makes herself conspicuous by some unfeminine accomplishment,—talks
slang, drives about in London, smokes cigarettes, is knowing in dogs,
horses, &c. An amusing anecdote is told of a FAST young lady, the
daughter of a right reverend prelate, who was an adept in _horseflesh_.
Being desirous of ascertaining the opinion of a candidate for
ordination, who had the look of a bird of the same feather, as to the
merits of some cattle just brought to her father’s palace for her to
select from, she was assured by him they were utterly unfit for a
lady’s use. With a knowing look at the horses’ points, she gave her
decision in these choice words, “Well, I agree with you; they _are_ a
rum lot, as the Devil said of the ten commandments.”

FAST, embarrassed, wanting money. Synonymous with HARD UP.—_Yorkshire._

FAT, a printer’s term signifying the void spaces on a page, for which
he is paid at the same rate as full or unbroken pages. This work
afforded much FAT for the printers.

FAT, rich, abundant, &c.; “a FAT lot;” “to cut it FAT,” to exaggerate,
to show off in an extensive or grand manner, to assume undue
importance; “cut up FAT,” see under CUT. As a _Theatrical_ term, a part
with plenty of FAT in it, is one which affords the actor an opportunity
of effective display.

FATHER, or FENCE, a buyer of stolen property.

FAWNEY, a finger ring.

FAWNEY BOUNCING, selling rings for a wager. This practice is founded
upon the old tale of a gentleman laying a wager that if he was to offer
“real gold sovereigns” at a penny a piece at the foot of London Bridge,
the English public would be too incredulous to buy. The story states
that the gentleman stationed himself with sovereigns in a tea tray, and
sold only two within the hour,—winning the bet. This tale the FAWNEY
BOUNCERS tell the public, only offering brass, double gilt rings,
instead of sovereigns.

FAWNEY, or FAWNEY RIG, ring dropping. A few years ago, this practice,
or RIG, was very common. A fellow purposely dropped a ring, or a pocket
book with some little articles of jewellery, &c., in it, and when he
saw any person pick it up, ran to claim half. The ring found, the
question of how the booty was to be divided had then to be decided.
The _Fawney_ says, “if you will give me eight or nine shillings for my
share the things are yours.” This the FLAT thinks very fair. The ring
of course is valueless, and the swallower of the bait discovers the
trick too late.

FEATHERS, money, wealth; “in full FEATHER,” rich.

FEEDER, a spoon.—_Old cant._

FEELE, a daughter, or child.—_Corrupted French._

FELT, a hat.—_Old term, in use in the sixteenth century._

shop or warehouse of a FENCER.—_Old cant._

FENCE, to sell or pawn stolen property to a FENCER.

FERRICADOUZER, a knock down below, a good thrashing. Probably derived
through the _Lingua Franca_ from the _Italian_, FAR’ CADER’ MORTO, to
knock down dead.

FIB, to beat, or strike.—_Old cant._

FIDDLE, a whip.

FIDDLE FADDLE, twaddle, or trifling discourse.—_Old cant._

FIDDLE STICKS! nonsense.

FIDDLER, or FADGE, a farthing.

FIDDLER, a sixpence.—_Household Words_, No. 183.

signification now. FOGGER, _old word_ for a huckster or servant.

FOGGY, tipsy.

FOGLE, a silk handkerchief—not a CLOUT, which is of _cotton_. It
has been hinted that this may have come from the _German_, VOGEL,
a bird, from the _bird’s eye_ spots on some handkerchiefs [_see_

term for picking pockets, and very curious it is to trace its origin.

GIGLAMPS, spectacles. In my first edition I stated this to be a
_University_ term. Mr. CUTHBERT BEDE, however, in a communication
to _Notes and Queries_, of which I have availed myself in the
present edition, says—“If the compiler has taken this epithet from
_Verdant Green_, I can only say that I consider the word not to be a
‘University’ word in general, but as only due to the inventive genius

weighed down, oppressed.—_Prompt. Parvulorum._

GYP, an undergraduate’s valet at _Cambridge_. Corruption of GYPSEY JOE

GYPS (γύπς), a vulture, from their dishonest rapacity. At _Oxford_ they
are called SCOUTS.

HACKLE, “to show HACKLE,” to be willing to fight. HACKLES are the
long feathers on the back of a cock’s neck, which he erects when
angry,—hence the metaphor.

HALF A BEAN, half a sovereign.

(street term for sheep’s trotters, or feet) two for a penny; who’ll
give me a HANSEL? who’ll give me a HANSEL?”—_Cry at Cloth Fair at the
present day._ Hence, earnest money, first fruits, &c. In Norfolk,

  “Wherein are various ranks, and due degrees,
  The Bench for honour, and the Stall for ease.”

Though often confounded with, they are utterly dissimilar to, the
modern High Church or Anglo-Catholic party. Their equally uninteresting
opponents deserved the corresponding appellation of LOW AND SLOW; while
the so-called “Broad Church” is defined with equal felicity as the

HOCUS, to drug a person, and then rob him. The HOCUS generally consists
of snuff and beer.

HOCUS POCUS, Gipsey words of magic, similar to the modern “presto
fly.” The Gipseys pronounce “_Habeas Corpus_,” HAWCUS PACCUS (_see
Crabb’s Gipsey’s Advocate_, p. 18); can this have anything to do with
the origin of HOCUS POCUS? _Turner_ gives OCHUS BOCHUS, an old demon.
Pegge, however, states that it is a burlesque rendering of the words
of the unreformed church service at the delivery of the host, HOC
EST CORPUS, which the early Protestants considered as a species of
conjuring, and ridiculed accordingly.

HODGE, a countryman or provincial clown. I don’t know that it has
been elsewhere remarked, but most country districts in England have
one or more families of the name of HODGE; indeed, GILES and HODGE
appear to be the favourite hobnail nomenclature. Not in any way writing
disrespectfully, was the slang word taken from Hog—with the _g_ soft,
which gives the _dg_ pronunciation? In old canting dictionaries HODGE
stands for a country clown; so, indeed, does ROGER, another favourite
provincial name.—_Vide Bacchus and Venus._

HOG, “to go the whole HOG,” to do anything with a person’s entire
strength, not “by halves;” realised by the phrase “in for a penny in
for a pound.” _Bartlett_ claims this to be a pure _American_ phrase;
whilst _Ker_, of course, gives it a _Dutch_ origin.—_Old._

HOG, a shilling.—_Old cant._

HOISTING, shoplifting.

HOLLOW, “to beat HOLLOW,” to excel.

HOLY LAND, Seven Dials,—where the St. Giles’ Greek is spoken.

HOOK, to steal or rob.—_See the following._

HOOK OR BY CROOK, by fair means or foul—in allusion to the hook which
footpads used to carry to steal from open windows, &c., and from which
HOOK, to take or steal, has been derived. Mentioned in _Hudibras_ as a
cant term.

HOOK IT, “get out of the way,” or “be off about your business;” “TO
HOOK IT,” to run away, to decamp; “on one’s own HOOK,” dependant upon
one’s own exertions.—_See the preceding for derivation._

HOOKS, “dropped off the HOOKS,” said of a deceased person—derived from
the ancient practice of suspending on hooks the quarters of a traitor
or felon sentenced by the old law to be hung, drawn, and quartered, and
which dropped off the hooks as they decayed.

HOOKEY WALKER! ejaculation of incredulity, usually shortened to
WALKER!—which see. A correspondent thinks HOOKEY WALKER may have been a
certain _Hugh K. Walker_.

HOOK-UM SNIVEY (formerly “hook _and_ snivey”), a low expression meaning
to cheat by feigning sickness or other means. Also a piece of thick
iron wire crooked at one end, and fastened into a wooden handle, for
the purpose of undoing from the outside the wooden bolt of a door.

HOP, a dance.—_Fashionable slang._

HOP THE TWIG, to run away, or BOLT, which see.—_Old._

HOP-MERCHANT, a dancing-master.

HOPPING GILES, a cripple. St. Ægidius or Giles, himself similarly
afflicted, was their patron saint. The ancient lazar houses were
dedicated to him.

HORRID HORN, term of reproach amongst the street Irish, meaning a fool,
or half-witted fellow. From the _Erse_ OMADHAUN, a brainless fellow. A
correspondent suggests HERRIDAN, a miserable old woman.

HORRORS, the low spirits, or “blue devils,” which follow intoxication.

HORSE, contraction of Horsemonger-lane Gaol.

HORSE CHAUNTER, a dealer who takes worthless horses to country fairs
and disposes of them by artifice. He is flexible in his ethics, and
will put in a glass-eye, or perform other tricks.—_See_ COPER.

HORSE NAILS, money.—_Compare_ BRADS.

HORSE’S NIGHTCAP, a halter; “to die in a HORSE’S NIGHTCAP,” to be hung.

HORSE MARINE, an awkward person. In ancient times the “JOLLIES” or
Royal Marines, were the butts of the sailors, from their ignorance of
seamanship. “Tell that to the MARINES, the blue jackets won’t believe
it!” was a common rejoinder to a “stiff yarn.” Now-a-days they are
deservedly appreciated as the finest regiment in the service. A HORSE
MARINE (an impossibility) was used to denote one more awkward still.

HOT COPPERS, the feverish sensations experienced next morning by those
who have been drunk over night.

HOT TIGER, an Oxford mixture of hot-spiced ale and sherry.

won’t do.”—_Norwich._

HULK, to hang about in hopes of an invitation.—_See_ MOOCH.

HULKY, extra sized.—_Shropshire._

HUM AND HAW, to hesitate, raise objections.—_Old English._

HUMBLE PIE, to “eat HUMBLE PIE,” to knock under, be submissive. The
UMBLES, or entrails of a deer, were anciently made into a dish for
servants, while their masters feasted off the haunch.

HUMBUG, an imposition, or a person who imposes upon others. A very
expressive but slang word, synonymous at one time with HUM AND HAW.
Lexicographers have fought shy at adopting this word. Richardson uses
it frequently to express the meaning of other words, but omits it in
the alphabetical arrangement as unworthy of recognition! In the first
edition of this work, 1785 was given as the earliest date at which
the word could be found in a printed book. Since then I have traced
HUMBUG half a century farther back, on the title-page of a singular old
jest-book—“_The Universal Jester_; or a pocket companion for the Wits:
being a choice collection of merry conceits, facetious drolleries, &c.,
clenchers, closers, closures, bon-mots, and HUMBUGS,” by _Ferdinando
Killigrew_. London, about 1735–40.

I have also ascertained that the famous Orator Henley was known to the
mob as ORATOR HUMBUG. The fact may be learnt from an illustration in
that exceedingly curious little collection of _Caricatures_, published
in 1757, many of which were sketched by Lord Bolingbroke—Horace
Walpole filling in the names and explanations. _Halliwell_ describes
HUMBUG as “a person who hums,” and cites Dean Milles’ MS., which was
written about 1760. It has been stated that the word is a corruption
of Hamburgh, from which town so many false bulletins and reports
came during the war in the last century. “Oh, that is _Hamburgh_ [or
HUMBUG],” was the answer to any fresh piece of news which smacked of
improbability. _Grose_ mentions it in his Dictionary, 1785; and in a
little printed squib, published in 1808, entitled _Bath Characters_, by
_T. Goosequill_, HUMBUG is thus mentioned in a comical couplet on the
title page:—

  “Wee Thre Bath Deities bee,
  HUMBUG, Follie, and Varietee.”

Gradually from this time the word began to assume a place in periodical
literature, and in novels not written by squeamish or over-precise
authors. In the preface to a flat, and, I fear, unprofitable poem,
entitled, _The Reign of_ HUMBUG, _a Satire_, 8vo., 1836, the author
thus apologises for the use of the word—“I have used the term HUMBUG
to designate this principle [wretched sophistry of life generally],
considering that it is now adopted into our language as much as
the words _dunce_, _jockey_, _cheat_, _swindler_, &c., which were
formerly only colloquial terms.” A correspondent, who in a late number
of _Adersaria_ ingeniously traced _bombast_ to the inflated Doctor
Paracelsus Bombast, considers that HUMBUG may, in like manner, be
derived from _Homberg_, the distinguished chemist of the court of the
Duke of Orleans, who, according to the following passage from Bishop
Berkeley’s “Siris,” was an ardent and successful seeker after the
philosopher’s stone!

  “§ 194.—Of this there cannot be a better proof than the experiment of
  Monsieur Homberg, WHO MADE GOLD OF MERCURY BY INTRODUCING LIGHT INTO
  ITS PORES, but at such trouble and expense, that, I suppose, nobody
  will try the experiment for profit. By this injunction of light and
  mercury, both bodies became fixed, and produced a third different to
  either, to wit, real gold. For the truth of which FACT I refer to the
  memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences.”—_Berkeley’s Works_, vol.
  ii., p. 366, (Wright’s edition).

The universal use of this term is remarkable; in California there is a
town called _Humbug Flat_—a name which gives a significant hint of the
acuteness of the first settler.

HUM-DRUM, tedious, tiresome, boring; “a society of gentlemen who used
to meet near the Charter House, or at the King’s Head, St. John’s
street. They were characterised by less mystery and more pleasantry
than the Freemasons.”—_Bacchus and Venus_, 1737. In the _West_ a low
cart.

HUMP, to botch, or spoil.

HUMP UP, “to have one’s HUMP UP,” to be cross or ill-tempered—like a
cat with its back set up.—_See_ MONKEY.

HUMPTY DUMPTY, short and thick.

HUNCH, to shove, or jostle.

HUNTER PITCHING, cockshies, or three throws a penny.—_See_ COCKSHY.

HUNTING THE SQUIRREL, when hackney and stage coachmen try to upset each
other’s vehicles on the public roads. _Nearly obsolete._

HURDY-GURDY, a droning musical instrument shaped like a large fiddle,
and turned by a crank, used by Savoyards and itinerant foreign
musicians in England, now nearly superseded by the hand-organ. A
correspondent suggests that the name is derived from being _girded_ on
the HARDIES, loins or buttocks.—_Scotch_; _Tam o’Shanter_. In _Italy_
the instrument is called VIOLA.

HUSH-MONEY, a sum given to quash a prosecution or evidence.

HUSH-SHOP, or CRIB, a shop where beer or spirits is sold “on the
quiet”—no licence being paid.

INTERESTING, “to be in an INTERESTING situation,” applied to females
when _enceinte_.

INTO, “hold my hat, Jim, I’ll be INTO him,” _i.e._, I will fight him.
In this sense equivalent to PITCH INTO or SLIP INTO.

convenience, in consideration of a douceur.

sovereigns and half-sovereigns, for which they are occasionally passed
to simple persons. In large gambling establishments the “heaps of gold”
are frequently composed mainly of JACKS.

JERUSALEM PONY, a donkey.

JESSIE, “to give a person JESSIE,” to beat him soundly.—_See_ GAS.

JEW’S EYE, a popular simile for anything valuable. Probably a
corruption of the _Italian_, GIOJE; _French_, JOUAILLE, a jewel. In
ancient times, when a king was short of cash, he generally issued
orders for so many _Jew’s eyes_, or equivalent sums of money. The Jews
preferred paying the ransom, although often very heavy. We thus realise
the popularly believed origin of JEW’S EYE. Used by _Shakespere_.

JEW-FENCER, a Jew street salesman.

JIB, the face, or a person’s expression; “the cut of his JIB,” _i.e._

JINGO, “by JINGO,” a common form of oath, said to be a corruption of
_St. Gingoulph_.—_Vide Halliwell._

JOB, a short piece of work, a prospect of employment. _Johnson_
describes JOB as a low word, without etymology. It is, and was,
however, a cant word, and a JOB, two centuries ago, was an arranged
robbery. Even at the present day it is mainly confined to the streets,
in the sense of employment for a short time. Amongst undertakers a JOB
signifies a funeral; “to do a JOB,” conduct any one’s funeral; “by
the JOB,” _i.e._, _piece_-work, as opposed to _time_-work. A JOB in
political phraseology is a Government office or contract, obtained by
secret influence or favouritism.

To JOE BLAKE THE BARTLEMY, to visit a low woman.

JOEY, a fourpenny piece. The term is derived (like BOBBY from Sir
Robert Peel) from Joseph Hume, the late respected M.P. The explanation
is thus given in _Hawkins’ History of the Silver Coinage of England_.

  “These pieces are said to have owed their existence to the pressing
  instance of Mr. Hume, from whence they, for some time, bore the
  nickname of JOEYS. As they were very convenient to pay short cab
  fares, the Hon. M.P. was extremely unpopular with the drivers,
  who frequently received only a _groat_ where otherwise they would
  have received a sixpence without any demand for change.” The term
  originated with the London cabmen, who have invented many others.

JOG-TROT, a slow but regular trot, or pace.

JOGUL, to play up, at cards or other game. _Spanish_, JUGAR.

JOHN THOMAS, a generic for “flunkies,”—footmen popularly represented
with large calves and bushy whiskers.

JOLLY, a word of praise, or favourable notice; “chuck Harry a JOLLY,
Bill!” _i.e._, go and praise up his goods, or buy of him, and speak
well of the article, that the crowd standing around his stall may
think it a good opportunity to lay out their money. “Chuck a JOLLY,”
literally translated, is to throw a shout or a good word.

with a rope attached and hauling them up from under the ship’s keel.

KEEP IT UP, to prolong a debauch, or the occasion of a rejoicing—a
metaphor drawn from the game of shuttlecock.—_Grose._

KEN, a house.—_Ancient cant._ KHAN, _Gipsey_ and _Oriental_.

⁂ All slang and cant words which end in KEN, such as SPIELKEN,
SPINIKEN, BAWDYKEN, or BOOZINGKEN, refer to _houses_, and are partly of
_Gipsey_ origin.

KEN-CRACKERS, housebreakers.

KENNEDY, to strike or kill with a poker. A St. Giles’ term, so given
from a man of that name being killed by a poker. Frequently shortened
to NEDDY.

KENT RAG, or CLOUT, a cotton handkerchief.

KERTEVER-CARTZO, the venereal disease. From the _Lingua Franca_,
CATTIVO, bad, and CAZZO, the male generative organ.

KETCH, or JACK KETCH, the popular name for a public hangman—derived
from a person of that name who officiated in the reign of Charles
II.—_See Macaulay’s History of England_, p. 626.

KICK THE BUCKET, to die.—_Norfolk._ According to Forby, a metaphor
taken from the descent of a well or mine, which is of course absurd.
The Rev. E. S. Taylor supplies me with the following note from his MS.
additions to the work of the East-Anglian lexicographer:—

  “The allusion is to the way in which a slaughtered pig is hung up,
  viz., by passing the ends of a bent piece of wood behind the tendons
  of the hind legs, and so suspending it to a hook in a beam above.
  This piece of wood is locally termed _a bucket_, and so by a coarse
  metaphor the phrase came to signify to die. Compare the Norfolk
  phrase “as wrong as a bucket.”

The natives of the West Indies have converted the expression into
KICKERABOO.

KICK-UP, a noise or disturbance.

KICK UP, “to KICK UP a _row_,” to create a tumult.

KICKSHAWS, trifles; made, or French dishes—not English, or substantial.
Corruption of the _French_, QUELQUES CHOSES.

KICKSIES, trousers.

KICKSY, troublesome, disagreeable.

  _Randall’s Diary_, 1820.

KIDMENT, a pocket-handkerchief fastened to the pocket, and partially
hung out to entrap thieves.

KIDNAPPER, one who steals children or adults. From KID, a child, and
NAB (corrupted to NAP), to steal, or seize.

KIDNEY, “of that KIDNEY,” of such a stamp: “strange KIDNEY,” odd
humour; “two of a KIDNEY,” two persons of a sort, or as like as two
peas, _i.e._, resembling each other like two kidneys in a bunch.—_Old._
“Attempt to put their hair out of KIDNEY.”—_Terræ Filius_, 1763.

KIDSMAN, one who trains boys to thieve and pick pockets successfully.

KILKENNY CAT, a popular simile for a voracious or desperate animal or
person, from the story of the two cats in that county, who are said to
have fought and bitten each other until a small portion of the tail of
one of them alone remained.

KILLING, bewitching, fascinating. The term is akin to the phrase
“dressing to DEATH.”

KIMBO, or A-KIMBO, holding the arms in a bent position from the body,
and resting the hands upon the hips, in a bullying attitude. Said to be
from A SCHEMBO, _Italian_; but more probably from KIMBAW, the old cant
for beating, or bullying.—_See Grose._

KINCHIN, a child.—_Old cant._ From the _German_ diminutive, KINDCHEN, a
baby.

KINCHIN COVE, a man who robs children; a little man.—_Ancient cant._

KINGSMAN, the favourite coloured neckerchief of the costermongers. The
women wear them thrown over their shoulders. With both sexes they are
more valued than any other article of clothing. A coster’s _caste_,
or position, is at stake, he imagines, if his KINGSMAN is not of the
most approved pattern. When he fights, his KINGSMAN is tied either
around his waist as a belt, or as a garter around his leg. This very
singular partiality for a peculiar coloured neckcloth was doubtless
derived from the Gipseys, and probably refers to an Oriental taste
or custom long forgotten by these vagabonds. A singular similarity
of taste for certain colours exists amongst the Hindoos, Gipseys,
and London costermongers. Red and yellow (or orange) are the great
favourites, and in these hues the Hindoo selects his turban and his
robe; the Gipsey his breeches, and his wife her shawl or gown; and the
costermonger his plush waistcoat and favourite KINGSMAN. Amongst either
class, when a fight takes place, the greatest regard is paid to the
favourite coloured article of dress. The Hindoo lays aside his turban,
the Gipsey folds up his scarlet breeches or coat, whilst the pugilistic
costermonger of Covent Garden or Billingsgate, as we have just seen,
removes his favourite neckerchief to a part of his body, by the rules
of the “ring,” comparatively out of danger. Amongst the various
patterns of kerchiefs worn by the wandering tribes of London, red
and yellow are the oldest and most in fashion. Blue, intermixed with
spots, is a late importation, probably from the Navy, through sporting
characters.

Yankee cousins.

KNOCK-OUTS, or KNOCK-INS, disreputable persons who visit auction
rooms and unite to buy the articles at their own prices. One of their
number is instructed to buy for the rest, and after a few small bids
as blinds to the auctioneer and bystanders, the lot is knocked down to
the KNOCK-OUT bidders, at a nominal price—the competition to result
from an auction being thus frustrated and set aside. At the conclusion
of the sale the goods are paid for, and carried to some neighbouring
public house, where they are re-sold or KNOCKED-OUT, and the difference
between the first purchase and the second—or tap-room KNOCK-OUT—is
divided amongst the gang. As generally happens with ill-gotten
gains, the money soon finds its way to the landlord’s pocket, and
the KNOCK-OUT is rewarded with a red nose or a bloated face. Cunning
tradesmen join the KNOCK-OUTS when an opportunity for money making
presents itself. The lowest description of KNOCK-OUTS, fellows with
more tongue than capital, are termed BABES,—which see.

KNOCKING-SHOP, a brothel, or disreputable house frequented by
prostitutes.

KNOWING, a slang term for sharpness; “KNOWING codger,” or “a KNOWING
blade,” one who can take you in, or cheat you, in any transaction you

one loses a bet, and decamps without settling, he is said to LEVANT.

common phrase meaning that great exertions are being made.—_Dryden;

or LOAFER, however, was in general use as a cant term in the early
part of the last century. LAND-LOPER, was a vagabond who begged in the
attire of a sailor; and the sea phrase, LAND-LUBBER, was doubtless

Cornwall.—_Old cant._

MARINE, or MARINE RECRUIT, an empty bottle. This expression having once
been used in the presence of an officer of marines, he was at first
inclined to take it as an insult, until some one adroitly appeased his

possibly imply was, “one who had done his duty, and was ready to do it
again.”—_See_ HORSE MARINE.—_Naval._

MEDICAL GREEK, the slang used by medical students at the hospitals. At
the London University they have a way of disguising English, described

about the Pound, and lean against the public-houses in the “Dials”
waiting for hire.

circumstances which may be turned to a profitable account; watching in
the streets for odd jobs, scraps, horses to hold, &c.

MOOE, the mouth; the female generative organ.—_Gipsey_ and _Hindoo_.
_Shakespere_ has MOE, to make mouths.

MOON, a month—generally used to express the length of time a person has
been sentenced by the magistrate; thus “ONE MOON” is one month.—_See_
DRAG. It is a curious fact that the Indians of America and the roaming
vagabonds of England should both calculate time by the MOON.

MOONEY, intoxicated.—_Household Words_, No. 183.

MOONLIGHT, or MOONSHINE, smuggled gin.

_Standard_ newspapers, while united under the proprietorship of Mr.

Dickens’ popular novel of _Martin Chuzzlewit_, who continually quoted
an imaginary _Mrs. Harris_ in attestation of the superiority of her
qualifications, and the infallibility of her opinions; and thus
afforded a parallel to the two newspapers, who appealed to each other
as independent authorities, being all the while the production of the
same editorial staff.

MUCK, to beat, or excel; “it’s no use, luck’s set in him; he’d MUCK
a thousand.”—_Mayhew_, vol. i, p. 18. TO RUN A MUCK, or GO A MUCKER,

MUNGARLY is doubtless derived from the _Lingua Franca_, MANGIAR, to
eat.—See the following.

MUNGARLY CASA, a baker’s shop; evidently a corruption of some _Lingua
Franca_ phrase for an eating house. The well known “Nix mangiare”
stairs at Malta derive their name from the endless beggars who lie
there and shout NIX MANGIARE, _i.e._, “nothing to eat,” to excite the
compassion of the English who land there,—an expression which exhibits
remarkably the mongrel composition of the _Lingua Franca_, MANGIARE
being _Italian_, and _Nix_ an evident importation from Trieste, or
other Austrian seaport.

animals; “kim up, MY TULIP,” as the coster said to his donkey when
thrashing him with an ash stick.

whereabouts of a domestic article, “Oh! only at MY UNCLE’S” is the
reply. UP THE SPOUT has the same meaning.

_Shakespere_ has the expression in Henry IV.—

  “_Falstaff._ What! is the old king dead?
  _Pistol._ As nail in door.”

A correspondent thinks the expression is only alliterative humour, and
compares as “_Flat as a Flounder_,” “straight as a soldier,” &c.

NAM, a policeman. Evidently _back slang_.

NAMBY PAMBY, particular, over nice, effeminate. This, I think, was of
Pope’s invention, and first applied by him to the affected short-lined
verses addressed by Ambrose Phillips to Lord Carteret’s infant
children.—_See Johnson’s Life of Pope._

called from its occupying the position of the rope when Jack Ketch

and thieves usually twist back towards the ear. The shape is supposed

the word:—

one tail, or _vice versâ_, the last is ODD MAN, and loses or wins as

AND Q’S,” be very careful. Originating, according to some, from the
similarity of p’s and q’s in the hornbook alphabet, and therefore the

French dancing master to his pupils, to mind their _pieds_ (feet) and
_queues_ (wigs) when making a bow.

_French_, PARLER.

PALL, to detect.

PALM OIL, or PALM SOAP, money.

PALMING, robbing shops by pairs,—one thief bargaining with apparent
intent to purchase, whilst the other watches his opportunity to steal.
An amusing example of PALMING came off some time since. A man entered
a “ready made” boot and shoe shop and desired to be shown a pair of
boots,—his companion staying outside and amusing himself by looking in
at the window. The one who required to be fresh shod was apparently
of a humble and deferential turn, for he placed his hat on the floor
directly he stepped in the shop. Boot after boot was tried on until at
last a fit was obtained,—when lo, forth came a man, snatched up the
customer’s hat left near the door, and down the street he ran as fast
as his legs could carry him. Away went the customer after his hat, and
Crispin, standing at the door, clapped his hands and shouted “go it,
you’ll catch him,”—little thinking that it was a concerted trick, and

PANTILE, a hat. The term PANTILE is properly applied to the mould
into which the sugar is poured which is afterwards known as “loaf
sugar.” Thus, PANTILE, from whence comes the phrase “a sugar-loaf hat,”
originally signified a tall, conical hat, in shape similar to that
usually represented as the head gear of a bandit. From PANTILE, the
more modern slang term TILE has been derived. _Halliwell_ gives PANTILE
SHOP, a meeting-house.

PANTILER, a dissenting preacher. Probably from the practice of the
Quakers, and many dissenters, of not removing the hat in a place of
worship.

PATTER, a speech or discourse, a pompous street oration, a judge’s
summing up, a trial. _Ancient_ word for muttering. Probably from the
_Latin_, PATER NOSTER, or Lord’s Prayer. This was said, before the
Reformation, in a _low voice_ by the priest, until he came to, “and
lead us not into temptation,” to which the choir responded, “but
deliver us from evil.” In our reformed Prayer Book this was altered,
and the Lord’s Prayer directed to be said “with a _loud voice_.”—_Dr.
Pusey_ takes this view of the derivation in his _Letter to the Bishop
of London_, p. 78, 1851. _Scott_ uses the word twice in _Ivanhoe_ and
the _Bride of Lammermoor_.

cant.

PATTERERS, men who cry last dying speeches, &c., in the streets, and
those who help off their wares by _long harangues_ in the public
thoroughfares. These men, to use their own term “are the haristocracy
of the street sellers,” and despise the costermongers for their
ignorance, boasting that they live by their intellect. The public,
they say, do not expect to receive from them an equivalent for their
money—they pay to hear them talk.—_Mayhew._ PATTERERS were formerly
termed “mountebanks.”

PAWS, hands.

PAY, to beat a person, or “serve them out.” Originally a nautical term,
meaning to stop the seams of a vessel with pitch (_French_, POIX);
“here’s the d——l to PAY, and no pitch hot,” said when any catastrophe
occurs which there is no means of averting; “to PAY over face and
eyes, as the cat did the monkey;” “to PAY through the nose,” to give a
ridiculous price.—whence the origin? _Shakespere_ uses PAY in the sense
of to beat, or thrash.

PEACH, to inform against or betray. _Webster_ states that _impeach_
is now the modification mostly used, and that PEACH is confined
principally to the conversation of thieves and the lower orders.

of the performers are arranged outside to give the front a gaudy and
attractive look, and at night-time coloured lamps and transparencies
are displayed to draw an audience.

PENNY-A-LINER, a contributor of local news, accidents, fires, scandal,
political and fashionable gossip, club jokes, and anecdotes, to a

PIG AND TINDER-BOX, the vulgar rendering of the well-known tavern sign,
“_Elephant and Castle_.”

PEPPER-BOXES, the buildings of the Royal Academy and National Gallery,
in Trafalgar-square. The name was first given by a wag, in allusion to
the cupolas erected by Wilkins, the architect, upon the roof, and which
at a distance suggest to the stranger the fact of their being enlarged
PEPPER-BOXES, from their form and awkward appearance.—_See_ BOILERS.

PIGEON, a gullible or soft person. The _French_ slang, or _argot_, has
the word PIGEON, dupe—“PECHON, PESCHON DE RUBY, apprenti gueux, enfant
(sans doute dérobé).” The vagabonds and brigands of Spain also use the

PLANT, a dodge, a preconcerted swindle; a position in the street to
sell from. PLANT, a swindle, may be thus described: a coster will join
a party of gambling costers that he never saw before, and commence
tossing. When sufficient time has elapsed to remove all suspicions of
companionship, his mate will come up and commence betting on each of
his PAL’S throws with those standing around. By a curious quickness
of hand, a coster can make the toss tell favourably for his wagering
friend, who meets him in the evening after the play is over and shares
the spoil.

place.—_Old cant._

PLUCK’D-’UN, a stout or brave fellow; “he’s a rare PLUCKED-’UN,”
_i.e._, dares face anything.

During the Crimean war, PLUCKY, signifying courageous, seemed likely
to become a favourite term in May-Fair, even among the ladies. An
eminent critic, however, who had been bred a butcher, having informed
the fashionable world that in his native town the _sheep’s head_ always
went with the PLUCK, the term has been gradually falling into discredit
at the West End.

It has been said that a brave soldier is PLUCKY in attack, and GAME
when wounded. Women are more GAME than PLUCKY.

POLL, the “ordinary degree” candidates for the B.A. Examination, who
do not aspire to the “Honours” list. From the _Greek_, ὁι πόλλοι,
“the many.” Some years ago, at Cambridge, Mr. Hopkins being the most
celebrated “honour coach,” or private tutor for the wranglers, and Mr.
Potts the principal “crammer” of the non-honour men, the latter was
facetiously termed the “POLLY HOPKINS” by the undergraduates.

POST-MORTEM, at Cambridge, the second examination which men who have
been “plucked” have to undergo.—_University._

POT, a sixpence, _i.e._, the price of a pot or quart of half-and-half.
A half crown, in medical student slang, is a FIVE-POT PIECE.

POT, “to GO TO POT,” to die; from the classic custom of putting the
ashes of the dead in an urn; also, to be ruined, or broken up,—often
applied to tradesmen who fail in business. GO TO POT! _i.e._, go and
hang yourself, shut up and be quiet. _L’Estrange_, to PUT THE POT ON,
to overcharge, or exaggerate.

POT, to finish; “don’t POT me,” term used at billiards. This word was
much used by our soldiers in the Crimea, for firing at the enemy from a
hole or ambush. These were called POT-SHOTS.

more regard to filling his bag than to the rules which regulate the

dinner,—a hearty term used to signify whatever the pot contains you are

POT-WALLOPERS, electors in certain boroughs before the passing of the
Reform Bill, whose qualification consisted in being housekeepers,—to
establish which, it was only necessary to boil a pot within the limits
of the borough, by the aid of any temporary erection. This implied that
they were able to provide for themselves, and not necessitated to apply
for parochial relief. WALLOP, a word of _Anglo Saxon_ derivation, from
the same root as _wall_.

POTTED, or POTTED OUT, cabined, confined; “the patriotic member of

PRICK THE GARTER, or PITCH THE NOB, a gambling and cheating game common
at fairs, and generally practised by thimble riggers. It consists of a
“garter” or a piece of list doubled, and then folded up tight. The bet
is made upon your asserting that you can, with a pin, “prick” the point
at which the garter is doubled. The garter is then unfolded, and nine
times out of ten you will find that you have been deceived, and that
you pricked one of the false folds. The owner of the garter, I should
state, holds the ends tightly with one hand. This was, doubtless,
originally a Gipsey game, and we are informed by _Brand_ that it was
much practised by the Gipseys in the time of _Shakespere_. In those
days, it was termed PRICKING AT THE BELT, or FAST AND LOOSE.

PRIG, a thief. Used by _Addison_ in the sense of a coxcomb. _Ancient
cant_, probably from the _Saxon_, PRICC-AN, to filch, &c.—_Shakespere._
PRIG, to steal, or rob. PRIGGING, thieving. In _Scotland_ the term PRIG
is used in a different sense from what it is in England. In Glasgow, or
at Aberdeen, “to PRIG a salmon,” would be to cheapen it, or seek for an
abatement in the price. A story is told of two Scotchmen, visitors to
London, who got into sad trouble a few years ago by announcing their
intention of “PRIGGING a hat” which they had espied in a fashionable
manufacturer’s window, and which one of them thought he would like to
possess.

PUDDING SNAMMER, one who robs a cook shop.

PUFF, to blow up, swell with praise, was declared by a writer in the
_Weekly Register_, as far back as 1732, to be illegitimate.

  “PUFF has become a cant word, signifying the applause set forth by
  writers, &c., to increase the reputation and sale of a book, and is
  an excellent stratagem to excite the curiosity of gentle readers.”

Lord Bacon, however, used the word in a similar sense a century before.

PULL, an advantage, or hold upon another; “I’ve the PULL over you,”
_i.e._, you are in my power—perhaps an oblique allusion to the judicial
sense.—_See the following._

magistrate.

PULL, to drink; “come, take a PULL at it,” _i.e._, drink up.

spice added:—

  Good ‘early PURL,’
  ’Gin all the world
  To put your hair into a curl,
  When you feel yourself queer of a mornin’.”

PUSH, a crowd.—_Old cant._

PUSSEY CATS, corruption of _Puseyites_, a name constantly, but

    Went so far as to call me a ‘Guy,’”

QUARTEREEN, a farthing.—_Gibraltar term._ _Ital._, QUATTRINO.

QUEAN (not QUEEN), a strumpet.

QUEER, an old cant word, once in continual use as a prefix, signifying
base, roguish, or worthless,—the opposite of RUM, which signified good
and genuine. QUEER, in all probability, is immediately derived from the
cant language. It has been mooted that it came into use from a _quære_
(?) being set before a man’s name; but it is more than probable that it
was brought into this country by the Gipseys from Germany, where QUER
signifies “_cross_,” or “_crooked_.” At all events, it is believed to
have been first used in England as a cant word.

QUEEN BESS, the Queen of Clubs,—perhaps because that queen, history
says, was of a swarthy complexion.—_North Hants._—_See Gentleman’s
Magazine for 1791_, p. 141.

QUEER, “to QUEER a flat,” to puzzle or confound a “gull” or silly
fellow.

  “Who in a _row_ like Tom could lead the van,
    _Booze_ in the _ken_, or at the _spellken_ hustle?
  Who QUEER a flat,” &c.

  _Don Juan_, canto xi., 19.

for any one in court. Insolvent Jews generally performed this office,

obsolete.

great hurry.

QUID, or THICK UN, a sovereign; “half a QUID,” half a sovereign; QUIDS,
money generally; “QUID for a QUOD,” one good turn for another. The word
is used by _Old French_ writers:—

  “Des testamens qu’on dit le maistre
  De mon fait n’aura QUID ne QUOD.”

  _Grand Testament de Villon._

QUID, a small piece of tobacco—one mouthful. _Quid est hoc?_ asked one,
tapping the swelled cheek of another; _hoc est quid_, promptly replied
the other, exhibiting at the same time “a chaw” of the weed. Probably a
corruption of CUD.

QUIET, “on the QUIET,” clandestinely, so as to avoid observation,
“under the rose.”

QUILL-DRIVER, a scrivener, a clerk—satirical phrase similar to STEEL
BAR-DRIVER, a tailor.

jerks its limbs about. The term is used in a slang sense to signify a
pseudo-politician, one whose strings of action are pulled by somebody
else.—_West._

QUOD, a prison, or lock up; QUODDED, put in prison. A slang expression
used by Mr. Hughes, in _Tom Brown’s Schooldays_ (Macmillan’s
Magazine, January, 1860), throws some light upon the origin of this
now very common street term:—“Flogged or whipped in QUAD,” says the
delineator of student life, in allusion to chastisement inflicted
within the _Quadrangle_ of a college. Quadrangle is the term given to
the prison inclosure within which culprits are allowed to walk, and
where whippings were formerly inflicted. Quadrangle also represents a
building of four sides; and to be “within FOUR WALLS,” or prison, is
the frequent slang lamentation of unlucky vagabonds.

bought the RABBIT.”

&c. Originally a species of counterfeit coin used for small change in

ROSE, “under the ROSE” (frequently used in its _Latin_ form, _Sub
rosâ_), _i.e._, under the obligation of silence and secresy, of which
the rose was anciently an emblem, perhaps, as Sir Thomas Browne
remarks, from the closeness with which its petals are enfolded in
the bud. The Rose of Venus was given, says the classic legend, to
Harpocrates, the God of Silence, by Cupid, as a bribe not to “peach”
about the Goddess’ amours. It was commonly sculptured on the ceilings
of banquetting rooms, as a sign that what was said in free conversation
there was not afterwards to be divulged and about 1526 was placed over

at a windlass. Fairs and merry-makings generally abound with them. The
frames take to pieces, and are carried in vans by miserable horses,
from fair to fair, &c.

ROW, a noisy disturbance, tumult, or trouble. Originally _Cambridge_,
now universal. Seventy years ago it was written ROUE, which would

RUGGY, fusty, frowsy.

RUM, like its opposite, QUEER, was formerly a much used prefix,
signifying, fine, good, gallant, or valuable, perhaps in some way
connected with ROME. Now-a-days it means indifferent, bad, or
questionable, and we often hear even persons in polite society use
such a phrase as “what a RUM fellow he is, to be sure,” in speaking of
a man of singular habits or appearance. The term, from its frequent
use, long since claimed a place in our dictionaries; but, with the
exception of _Johnson_, who says RUM, a cant word for a clergyman (?),
no lexicographer has deigned to notice it.

harlot.

stalls at early morning, prepared from a powder made of the root of
the _Orchis mascula_, or Red-handed Orchis. Within a few years coffee
stands have superseded SALOOP stalls, but Charles Lamb, in one of his
papers, has left some account of this drinkable, which he says was of
all preparations the most grateful to the stomachs of young chimney
sweeps.

SALT, “its rather too SALT,” said of an extravagant hotel bill.

SALT BOX, the condemned cell in Newgate.

SALTEE, a penny. Pence, &c., are thus reckoned:—

⁂ This curious list of numerals in use among the London street folk is,
strange as it may seem, derived from the _Lingua Franca_, or bastard
_Italian_, of the Mediterranean seaports, of which other examples
may be found in the pages of this Dictionary. SALTEE, the cant term
used by the costermongers and others for a penny, is no other than
the _Italian_, SOLDO (plural, SOLDI), and the numerals—as may be
seen by the _Italian_ equivalents—are a tolerably close imitation
of the originals. After the number SIX, a curious variation occurs,
which is peculiar to the London cant, seven being reckoned as SAY
ONEY, _six-one_, SAY DOOE, _six-two_ = 8, and so on. DACHA, I may
remark, is perhaps from the _Greek_, DEKA (δέκα), ten, which, in the
Constantinopolitan _Lingua Franca_, is likely enough to have been
substituted for the _Italian_. MADZA, is clearly the _Italian_ MEZZA.
The origin of BEONG I have not been so fortunate as to discover, unless
it be the _French_, BIEN, the application of which to a shilling is
not so evident; but amongst costermongers and other street folk, it
is quite immaterial what foreign tongue contributes to their secret
language. Providing the terms are unknown to the police and the public
generally, they care not a rushlight whether the polite French, the gay
Spaniards, or the cloudy Germans helped to swell their vocabulary. The
numbers of low foreigners, however, dragging out a miserable existence
in our crowded neighbourhoods, organ grinders and image sellers,
foreign seamen from the vessels in the river, and our own connection
with Malta and the Ionian Isles, may explain, to a certain extent,
the phenomenon of these Southern phrases in the mouths of costers and
tramps.

have got our word CASH!

SHAVE, a false alarm, a hoax, a sell. This was much used in the Crimea
during the Russian campaign.

SHAVE, a narrow escape. At Cambridge, “just SHAVING through,” or
“making a SHAVE,” is just escaping a “pluck” by coming out at the
bottom of the list.

  “My terms are anything but dear,
  Then read with me, and never fear;
  The examiners we’re sure to queer,
  And get through, if you make a SHAVE on’t.”

    Out of his bullock head.”

SHEEP’S FOOT, an iron hammer used in a printing office, the end of the

be so situated when they cannot meet with a husband; “on the SHELF,”
pawned.

SHELL OUT, to pay or count out money.

SHICE, nothing; “to do anything for SHICE,” to get no payment. The
term was first used by the Jews in the last century. _Grose_ gives the
phrase CHICE-AM-A-TRICE, which has a synonymous meaning. _Spanish_,
CHICO, little; _Anglo Saxon_, CHICHE, niggardly.

SHICER, a mean man, a humbug, a “duffer,”—a person who is either
worthless or will not work.

SHICKERY, shabby, bad.

tomb.

SHIVERING JEMMY, the name given by street folk to any cadger who
exposes himself, half naked, on a cold day, to excite pity and procure
alms. The “game” is unpleasant, but exceedingly lucrative.

SHODDY, old cloth worked up into new; also, a term of derision applied
to workmen in woollen factories.—_Yorkshire._

SHOE, to free, or initiate a person,—a practice common in most trades
to a new comer. The SHOEING consists in paying for beer, or other
drink, which is drunk by the older hands. The cans emptied, and the
bill paid, the stranger is considered properly SHOD.

SHOE LEATHER! a thief’s warning cry, when he hears footsteps. This
exclamation is used in the same spirit as Bruce’s friend, who, when he
suspected treachery towards him at King Edward’s court, in 1306, sent
him a purse and a pair of spurs, as a sign that he should use them in
making his escape.

by _Cowper_ and _Byron_.

SHORT, when spirit is drunk without any admixture of water, it is said
to be taken “short;” “summat SHORT,” a dram. A similar phrase is used
at the counters of banks; upon presenting a cheque, the clerk asks,
“how will you take it?” _i.e._, in gold, or in notes? Should it be
desired to receive it in as small a compass as possible, the answer is,
“SHORT.”

SHORT COMMONS, short allowance of food.—_See_ COMMONS.

SHOT, from the modern sense of the word to SHOOT,—a guess, a random
conjecture; “to make a bad SHOT,” to expose one’s ignorance by making
a wrong guess, or random answer without knowing whether it is right or
wrong.

SHOT, from the once _English_, but now provincial word, to SHOOT, to
subscribe, contribute in fair proportion;—a share, the same as SCOT,
both being from the _Anglo Saxon_ word, SCEAT; “to pay one’s SHOT,”
_i.e._, share of the reckoning, &c.

SHOT, “I wish I may be SHOT, if,” &c., a common form of mild swearing.

SHOVE-HALFPENNY, a gambling street game.

SHOWFULL, or SCHOFELL, a Hansom cab,—said to have been from the name of
the inventor.—_Led de hor qu._

SHOW-FULL, or SCHOFUL, bad money. _Mayhew_ thinks this word is from the
_Danish_, SKUFFE, to shove, to deceive, cheat; _Saxon_, SCUFAN,—whence
the _English_, SHOVE. The term, however, is possibly one of the many
street words from the _Hebrew_ (through the low Jews); SHEPHEL, in
that language, signifying a _low_ or debased estate. _Chaldee_,
SHAPHAL.—_See_ Psalm cxxxvi. 23, “in our _low estate_.” A correspondent
suggests another very probable derivation, from the _German_, SCHOFEL,
trash, rubbish,—the _German_ adjective, SCHOFELIG, being the nearest
possible translation of our _shabby_.

SHOWFULL-PITCHER, a passer of counterfeit money.

SHOWFULL PITCHING, passing bad money.

SHOWFULL PULLET, a “gay” woman.

SHRIMP, a diminutive person.—_Chaucer._

SHUNT, to throw or turn aside.—_Railway term._

SHUT OF, or SHOT OF, rid of.

SHUT UP! be quiet, don’t make a noise; to stop short, to make cease
in a summary manner, to silence effectually. “Only the other day we
heard of a preacher who, speaking of the scene with the doctors in
the Temple, remarked that the Divine disputant completely SHUT THEM
UP!”—_Athen._ 30th July, 1859. SHUT UP, utterly exhausted, done for.

SHY, a throw.

SHY, “to fight SHY of a person,” to avoid his society either from
dislike, fear, or any other reason. SHY has also the sense of flighty,
unsteady, untrustworthy.

SHY, to fling; COCK-SHY, a game at fairs, consisting of throwing short
sticks at trinkets set upon other sticks,—both name and practice
derived from the old game of throwing or SHYING at live cocks.

SICES, or SIZES, a throw of _sixes_ at dice.

SICK AS A HORSE, popular simile,—curious, because a horse never vomits.

SICKNER, or SICKENER, a dose too much of anything.

the little one, which is agitated in token of derision.—_See_ WALKER.

SIM, one of a Methodistical turn in religion; a low-church-man;
originally a follower of the late Rev. Charles Simeon.—_Cambridge._

SIMON, a sixpenny piece.

SIMON PURE, “the real SIMON PURE,” the genuine article. Those who have
witnessed Mr. C. Mathews’ performance in Mrs. Centlivre’s admirable
comedy of _A Bold Stroke for a Wife_, and the laughable coolness
with which he, the _false_ SIMON PURE, assuming the quaker dress and
character of the REAL ONE, elbowed that worthy out of his expected
entertainment, will at once perceive the origin of this phrase.—_See_
act v., scene 1.

SING OUT, to call aloud.—_Sea._

SING SMALL, to lessen one’s boasting, and turn arrogance into humility.

SINKERS, bad money.

SINKS, a throw of fives at dice. _French_, CINQS.

SIR HARRY, a close stool.

SISERARA, a hard blow.—_Suffolk._ Moor derives it from the story of
Sisera in the Old Testament, but it is more probably a corruption of
CERTIORARI, a Chancery writ reciting a complaint of hard usage.

SIT UNDER, a term employed in Dissenters’ meeting houses, to denote
attendance on the ministry of any particular preacher.

SITTING PAD, sitting on the pavement in a begging position.

SIT-UPONS, trousers.—_See_ INEXPRESSIBLES.

SIVVY, “’pon my SIVVY,” _i.e._, upon my soul or honour. Corruption of
_asseveration_, like DAVY, which is an abridgment of _affidavit_.

SIXES AND SEVENS, articles in confusion are said to be all SIXES and
SEVENS. The Deity is mentioned in the Towneley Mysteries as He that
“sett all on seven,” _i.e._, set or appointed everything in seven days.
A similar phrase at this early date implied confusion and disorder,
and from these, _Halliwell_ thinks, has been derived the phrase “to be
at SIXES AND SEVENS.” A Scotch correspondent, however, states that the
phrase probably came from the workshop, and that amongst needle makers
when the points and eyes are “heads and tails” (“heeds and thraws”),
or in confusion, they are said to be SIXES AND SEVENS, because those
numbers are the sizes most generally used, and in the course of
manufacture have frequently to be distinguished.

SIXTY, “to go along like SIXTY,” _i.e._, at a good rate, briskly.

SIZE, to order extras over and above the usual commons at the dinner
in college halls. Soup, pastry, &c., are SIZINGS, and are paid for
at a certain specified rate _per_ SIZE, or portion, to the college
cook.—_Peculiar to Cambridge._ _Minsheu_ says, “SIZE, a farthing which
schollers in Cambridge have at the buttery, noted with the letter _s_.”

SIZERS, or SIZARS, are certain poor scholars at Cambridge, annually
elected, who get their dinners (including _sizings_) from what is left
at the upper, or Fellows’ table, free, or nearly so. They pay rent of
rooms, and some other fees, on a lower scale than the “Pensioners” or
ordinary students, and answer to the “battlers” and “servitors” at
Oxford.

SIZINGS, _see_ SIZE.

SKIPPER-BIRDS, or KEYHOLE WHISTLERS, persons who sleep in barns or
outhouses in preference to lodging-houses.

SKITTLES, a game similar to Ten Pins, which, when interdicted by the
Government was altered to Nine Pins, or SKITTLES. They are set up in an
alley and are _thrown at_ (not bowled) with a round piece of hard wood,
shaped like a small flat cheese. The costers consider themselves the
best players in London.

SKROUGE, to push or squeeze.—_North._

SKULL-THATCHERS, straw bonnet makers,—sometimes called
“bonnet-BUILDERS.”

SKY, a disagreeable person, an enemy.—_Westminster School._

SKY-BLUE, London milk much diluted with water, or from which the cream
has been too closely skimmed.

  “Hence, Suffolk dairy wives run mad for cream,
  And leave their milk with nothing but the name;
  Its name derision and reproach pursue,
  And strangers tell of three times skimmed—SKY-BLUE.”

  _Bloomfield’s Farmer’s Boy._

SKY-BLUE formerly meant gin.

SKY-LARK.—_See_ LARK.

SKY PARLOUR, the garret.

SKY SCRAPER, a tall man; “are you cold up there, old SKY SCRAPER?”
Properly a sea term; the light sails which some adventurous skippers
set above the royals in calm latitudes are termed SKY-SCRAPERS and
MOON-RAKERS.

SKY WANNOCKING, unsteady, frolicking.—_Norfolk._

SLAMMOCK, a slattern or awkward person.—_West_; and _Norf._

SLANG, low, vulgar, unwritten, or unauthorised language. _Gipsey_,
SLANG, the secret language of the Gipseys, synonymous with GIBBERISH,
another Gipsey word. This word is only to be found in the Dictionaries
of _Webster_ and _Ogilvie_. It was, perhaps, first recorded by _Grose_,
in his _Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_, 1785. SLANG, since it has
been adopted as an English word, generally implies vulgar language not
known or recognised as CANT; and latterly, when applied to speech, has
superseded the word FLASH.

SLANG, counterfeit or short weights and measures. A SLANG quart is a
pint and a half. SLANG measures are lent out at 2d. per day. The term
is used principally by costermongers.

SLANG, to cheat, to abuse in foul language.

SLANG, a travelling show.

SLANG, a watch chain.

SLAP-DASH, immediately, or quickly.

SLASH, a pocket in an overcoat.

SLASHER, a powerful roisterer, a pugilist; “the TIPTON SLASHER.”

the reviewers, to “cut up.”

SLATE, “he has a SLATE loose,” _i.e._, he is slightly crazy.

SLAVEY, a maid servant.

SLEWED, drunk, or intoxicated.—_Sea term._ When a vessel changes the
tack she, as it were, staggers, the sails flap, she gradually heels
over, and the wind catching the waiting canvas, she glides off at
another angle. The course pursued by an intoxicated, or SLEWED man, is
supposed to be analogous to that of the ship.

SLICK, an _Americanism_, very prevalent in England since the
publication of Judge Haliburton’s facetious stories. As an _adjective_,
SLICK means rapidly, effectually, utterly; as a _verb_, it has the
force of “to despatch rapidly,” turn off, get done with a thing.

SLICK A DEE, a pocket book.

SLING, to pass from one person to another.

SLIP, “to give the SLIP,” to run away, or elude pursuit. _Shakespere_
has “you _gave me the counterfeit_,” in Romeo and Juliet. GIVING THE
SLIP, however, is a _Sea phrase_, and refers to fastening an anchor
and chain cable to a floating buoy, or water cask, until such a time
arrives that is convenient to return and take them on board. In
fastening the cable, the home end is _slipped_ through the hawse pipe.
Weighing anchor is a noisy task, so that giving it the SLIP infers to
leave it in quietness.

SLIP, or LET SLIP; “to SLIP into a man,” to give him a sound beating;
“to LET SLIP at a cove,” to rush violently upon him, and assault with
vigour.

SLOG, or SLOGGER (its original form), to beat, baste, or wallop.
_German_, SCHLAGEN; or, perhaps a vulgar corruption of SLAUGHTER. The
pretended _Greek_ derivation from σλογω, which _Punch_ puts in the
mouth of the schoolboy, in his impression of 4th May, 1859, is of
course only intended to mystify grandmamma, there being no such word in
the language.

SLOGGERS, _i.e._, SLOW-GOERS, the second division of race-boats at
_Cambridge_. At _Oxford_ they are called TORPIDS.—_Univ._

SLOGGING, a good beating.

SLOP, cheap, or ready made, as applied to clothing, is generally
supposed to be a modern appropriation; but it was used in this sense in
1691, by _Maydman_, in his _Naval Speculations_; and by _Chaucer_ two
centuries before that. Slops properly signify sailors’ working clothes.

SLOP, a policeman. Probably at first _back slang_, but now general.

SLOPE, to decamp, to run, or rather _slip_ away. Originally from
LOPE, to make off; the _s_ probably became affixed as a portion
of the preceding word, as in the case of “_let’s lope_,” let us
run.—_Americanism._

SLOPS, chests or packages of tea; “he shook a slum of SLOPS,” _i.e._,
stole a chest of tea.

  “And this, without more SLUM, began,
  Over a flowing Pot-house can,
  To settle, without botheration,
  The rigs of this here tip-top nation.”

  _Jack Randall’s Diary_, 1820.

this sense is _old cant_.

SLUMMING, passing bad money.

Westminster SLUMS,” favourite haunts for thieves.

great opinion of his own importance. SMALL COALS is also used in the
same sense.

break, or “go to the dogs.”

SMASH, to pass counterfeit money.

made from this metal.

SMELLER, a blow on the nose, or a NOSER.

SMIGGINS, soup served to convicts on board the hulks.

SMISH, a shirt, or chemise. Corruption of the _Span_.—See MISH.

is a _Lincolnshire_ word for a fragment.

August, 1859.

snatching the tops, or small play property, of other lads, and then
running off at full speed.

  “Tops are in; spin ’em agin.
  Tops are out; SMUGGING about.”

SMUT, a copper boiler. Also, the “blacks” from a furnace.

SMUTTY, obscene,—vulgar as applied to conversation.

SNACK, booty, or share. Also, a light repast.—_Old cant and Gipsey
term._

SNAFFLED, arrested, “pulled up,”—so termed from a kind of horse’s bit,
called a SNAFFLE. In _East Anglia_, to SNAFFLE is to talk foolishly.

SNAGGLE TEETH, uneven, and unpleasant looking dental operators.—_West._
SNAGS (_Americanism_), ends of sunken drift-wood sticking out of the
water, on which river steamers are often wrecked.

SNAGGLING, angling after geese with a hook and line, the bait being a

made in the form of that bird.

SNITCHERS, persons who turn queen’s evidence, or who tell tales. In
_Scotland_, SNITCHERS signify handcuffs.

SNOB, a low, vulgar, or affected person. Supposed to be from the
nickname usually applied to a Crispin, or a maker of shoes; but
believed by a writer in _Notes and Queries_ to be a contraction of
the _Latin_, SINE OBOLO. A more probable derivation, however, has
just been forwarded by an ingenious correspondent. He supposes that
NOBS, _i.e._, _Nobiles_, was appended in lists to the names of
persons of gentle birth, whilst those who had not that distinction
were marked down as S. NOB., _i.e._, _sine nobilitate_, without
marks of gentility,—thus reversing its meaning. Another
“word-twister” remarks that, as at college sons of nobleman wrote
after their names in the admission lists, _fil nob._, son of a lord,
and hence all young noblemen were called NOBS, and what they did
NOBBY, so those who imitated them would be called _quasi-nobs_,
“like a nob,” which by a process of contraction would be shortened
to _si-nob_, and then SNOB, one who pretends to be what he is not,
and apes his betters. The short and expressive terms which many
think fitly represent the three great estates of the realm, NOB,
SNOB, and MOB, were all originally slang words. The last has safely
passed through the vulgar ordeal of the streets, and found
respectable quarters in the standard dictionaries.

SNOBBISH, stuck up, proud, make believe.

SNOB-STICK, a workman who refuses to join in strikes, or trade unions.
Query, properly KNOB-STICK.

an idle question, or as the perpetrator of a senseless joke.

SNOOZE, or SNOODGE (vulgar pronunciation), to sleep or doze.

SNOT, a term of reproach applied to persons by the vulgar when vexed or
annoyed. In a Westminster school vocabulary for boys, published in the
last century, the term is curiously applied. Its proper meaning is the
glandular mucus discharged through the nose.

SNOTTER, or WIPE-HAULER, a pickpocket who commits great depredations
upon gentlemen’s pocket-handkerchiefs.—_North._

SNOTTINGER, a coarse word for a pocket-handkerchief. The German
_schnupftuch_ is, however, nearly as plain. A handkerchief was also
anciently called a MUCKINGER, or MUCKENDER.

SNOTS, small bream, a slimy kind of flat fish.—_Norwich._

SNOW, wet linen.

SNOW GATHERERS, or SNOW-DROPPERS, rogues who steal linen from hedges

to a recommendation to prepare a walking staff in readiness for a
journey—in allusion to the Eastern custom of cutting a stick before
setting out—or from the ancient mode of reckoning by notches or tallies
on a stick. In Cornwall the peasantry tally sheaves of corn by cuts in
a stick, reckoning by the score. CUT YOUR STICK in this sense may mean
to make your mark and pass on—and so realise the meaning of the phrase
“IN THE NICK (or notch) OF TIME.” Sir J. Emerson Tennent, in _Notes and
Queries_ (December, 1859), considers the phrase equivalent to “cutting

they retaliate small grudges in a playful facetious way. Forby says,
good housewives in Norfolk consider themselves reminded by the name to
mix the ingredients for their Christmas mince pies.

other small coin, is always given by the buyer to the seller to ratify
the bargain.—_Hudibras._ Anciently this was called a GOD’S PENNY.

The origin of the phrase being lost sight of, like that of many others,
it is often corrupted now-a-days into STRIKE ME SILLY.

“only eight a penny.”—_Vide Athenæum_, 26th March, 1859. Sometimes
amplified to STUNNING JOE BANKS! when the expression is supposed to be
in its most intense form. JOE BANKS was a noted character in the last
generation. He was the proprietor of a public-house in Dyott-street,
Seven Dials, and afterwards, on the demolition of the Rookery, of
another in Cranbourne-alley. His houses became well-known from their
being the resort of the worst characters, at the same time that the
strictest decorum was always maintained in them. JOE BANKS also
acquired a remarkable notoriety by acting as a medium betwixt thieves
and their victims. Upon the proper payment to Joe, a watch or a snuff
box would at any time be restored to its lawful owner—“no questions in
any case being asked.” The most daring depredators in London placed the
fullest confidence in Joe, and it is believed (although the _Biographie
Universelle_ is quiet upon this point) that he never, in any instance,
“sold” them. He was of the middle height, stout, and strongly made, and
was always noted for a showy pin, and a remarkably STUNNING _neck-tie_.
It was this peculiarity in the costume of Mr. Banks, coupled with
those true and tried qualities as a friend, for which, as I have just
remarked, he was famous, that led his customers to proclaim him as
STUNNING JOE BANKS! The Marquis of Douro, Colonel Chatterley, and men
of their stamp, were accustomed to resort to a private room at his
house, when too late or too early to gain admittance to the clubs or
more aristocratic establishments.

who, hearing one of John Wesley’s preachers mention the _swaddling
clothes_ of the Holy Infant, in a sermon on Christmas-day at Dublin,
shouted out in derision, “_A swaddler! a swaddler!_” as if the whole
story were the preacher’s invention.—_Southey’s Life of Wesley_, vol.

WALKER! or HOOKEY WALKER! an ejaculation of incredulity, said when a
person is telling a story which you know to be all gammon, or false.
The _Saturday Reviewer’s_ explanation of the phrase is this:—“Years
ago, there was a person named _Walker_, an aquiline-nosed Jew,
who exhibited an orrery, which he called by the erudite name of
_Eidouranion_. He was also a popular lecturer on astronomy, and often
invited his pupils, telescope in hand, to _take a sight_ at the moon
and stars. The lecturer’s phrase struck his school-boy auditory, who
frequently “took a sight” with that gesture of outstretched arm, and
adjustment to nose and eye, which was the first garnish of the popular
saying. The next step was to assume phrase and gesture as the outward
and visible mode of knowingness in general.” A correspondent, however,
denies this, and states that HOOKEY WALKER was a magistrate of dreaded
acuteness and incredulity, whose hooked nose gave the title of BEAK to
all his successors; and, moreover, that the gesture of applying the
thumb to the nose and agitating the little finger, as an expression of
“Don’t you wish you may get it?” is considerably older than the story
in the _Saturday Review_ would seem to indicate. There is a third
explanation of HOOKEY WALKER in _Notes and Queries_, iv., 425.

either from choice or not being able to obtain a partner.

WALL-FLOWERS, left-off and “regenerated” clothes, exposed for sale in

from an ancestor of the Earl of Portsmouth, one Sir John Wallop, Knight

(_Canterbury Tales_, 4153)—

  “So was hir joly WHISTAL well Y-WET;”

WILD, vexed, cross, passionate. In the United States the word _mad_ is
supplemented with a vulgar meaning similar to our Cockneyism, WILD; and

“rile” his temper—not to render him a raving maniac, or a fit subject
for Bedlam.

WILD OATS, youthful pranks.

SOME ACCOUNT OF THE BACK SLANG,

THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF COSTERMONGERS.


The costermongers of London number between thirty and forty thousand.
Like other low tribes, they boast a language, or secret tongue, in
which they hide their earnings, movements, and other private affairs.
This costers’ speech, as Mayhew remarks, offers no new fact, or
approach to a fact, for philologists; it is not very remarkable for
originality of construction; neither is it spiced with low humour,
as other cant. But the costermongers boast that it is known only to
themselves; that it is far beyond the Irish, and puzzles the Jews.

_The main principle of this language is spelling the words
backwards,—or rather, pronouncing them rudely backwards._ Sometimes,
for the sake of harmony, an extra syllable is prefixed, or annexed;
and, occasionally, the word is given quite a different turn in
rendering it backwards, from what an uninitiated person would have
expected. One coster told Mayhew that he often gave the end of a word
“a new turn, just as if he chorussed it with a tol-de-rol.” Besides,
the coster has his own idea of the _proper_ way of spelling words, and
is not to be convinced but by an overwhelming show of learning,—and
frequently not then, for he is a very headstrong fellow. By the time
a coster has spelt an ordinary word of two or three syllables in the
proper way, and then spelt it backwards, it has become a tangled knot
that no etymologist could unravel. The word GENERALISE, for instance,
is considered to be “shilling” spelt backwards. Sometimes Slang
and Cant words are introduced, and even these, when imagined to be
tolerably well known, are pronounced backwards. Other terms, such as
GEN, a shilling, and FLATCH, a halfpenny, help to confuse the outsider.

After a time, this back language, on BACK-SLANG, as it is called by the
costermongers themselves, comes to be regarded by the rising generation
of street sellers as a distinct and regular mode of speech. They never
refer words, by inverting them, to their originals; and the YENEPS and
ESCLOPS, and NAMOWS, are looked upon as proper, but secret terms. “But
it is a curious fact, that lads who become costermongers’ boys, without
previous association with the class, acquire a very ready command of
the language, and this though they are not only unable to spell, but
‘don’t know a letter in a book.[56]’” They soon obtain a considerable
stock vocabulary, so that they converse rather from the memory than the
understanding. Amongst the senior costermongers, and those who pride
themselves on their proficiency in BACK-SLANG, a conversation is often
sustained for a whole evening, especially if any “flatties” are present
whom they wish to astonish or confuse. The women use it sparingly, but
the girls are generally well acquainted with it.

The addition of an _s_, I should state, always forms the plural, so
that this is another source of complication. For instance, _woman_
in the BACK-SLANG, is NAMOW, and NAMUS, or NAMOWS, is _women_, not
NEMOW. The explorer, then, in undoing the BACK-SLANG, and turning the
word NAMUS once more into English, would have _suman_,—a novel and
very extraordinary rendering of _women_. Where a word is refractory in
submitting to a back rendering, as in the case of _pound_, letters are
made to change positions for the sake of harmony; thus, we have DUNOP,
a pound, instead of _dnuop_ which nobody could pleasantly pronounce.
This will remind the reader of the Jews’ “_old clo! old clo!_” instead
of _old clothes, old clothes_, which would tire even the patience of a
Jew to repeat all day.

This singular BACK tongue has been in vogue about twenty-five years.
It is, as before stated, soon acquired, and is principally used by the
costermongers (as the specimen Glossary will show), for communicating
the secrets of their street tradings, the cost and profit of the goods,
and for keeping their natural enemies, the police, in the dark. COOL
THE ESCLOP (look at the police) is often said amongst them, when one of
the constabulary makes his appearance.

Perhaps on no subject is the costermonger so particular as on money
matters. All costs and profits he thinks should be kept profoundly
secret. The Back Slang, therefore, gives the various small amounts very
minutely.

  FLATCH, halfpenny.

  YENEP, penny.

  OWT-YENEPS, twopence.

  ERTH-YENEPS, threepence.

  ROUF-YENEPS, fourpence.

  EVIF, or EWIF-YENEPS, fivepence.

  EXIS-YENEPS, sixpence.

  NEVIS-YENEPS, sevenpence.

  TEAICH, or THEG-YENEPS, eightpence.

  ENIN-YENEPS, ninepence.

  NET-YENEPS, tenpence.

  NEVELÉ-YENEPS, elevenpence.

  EVLÉNET-YENNEPS, twelvepence.

  GEN, or ENO-GEN, one shilling.

  OWT-GENS, two shillings.

  ERTH-GENS, three shillings.

The GENS continue in the same sequence as the YENEPS above, excepting
THEG-GENS, 8s., which is usually rendered THEG-GUY,—a deviation with
ample precedents in all civilised tongues.

  YENORK, a crown piece, or five shillings.

  FLATCH-YENORK, half-a-crown.

Beyond this amount the costermonger reckons after an intricate
and complicated mode. Fifteen shillings would be ERTH-EVIF-GENS,
or, literally, three times 5s.; seventeen shillings would be
ERTH-YENORK-FLATCH, or three crowns and a half; or, by another mode of
reckoning, ERTH-EVIF-GENS FLATCH-YENORK, _i.e._, three times 5s., and
half-a-crown.

  DUNOP, a pound.

Further than which the costermonger seldom goes in money reckoning.

In the following Glossary only those words are given which
costermongers principally use,—the terms connected with street
traffic, the names of the different coins, vegetables, fruit and fish,
technicalities of police courts, &c.

The reader might naturally think that a system of speech so simple as
the BACK-SLANG would require no Glossary; but he will quickly perceive,
from the specimens given, that a great many words in frequent use in a
BACK sense, have become so twisted as to require a little glossarial
explanation.

SOME ACCOUNT OF THE RHYMING SLANG,

THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF CHAUNTERS AND PATTERERS.


There exists in London a singular tribe of men, known amongst the
“fraternity of vagabonds” as Chaunters and Patterers. Both classes
are great talkers. The first sing or chaunt through the public
thoroughfares ballads—political and humorous—carols, dying speeches,
and the various other kinds of gallows and street literature. The
second deliver street orations on grease-removing compounds, plating
powders, high polishing blacking, and the thousand and one wonderful
pennyworths that are retailed to gaping mobs from a London kerb stone.

They are quite a distinct tribe from the costermongers; indeed, amongst
tramps, they term themselves the “harristocrats of the streets,” and
boast that they live by their intellects. Like the costermongers,
however, they have a secret tongue or Cant speech, known only to each
other. This Cant, which has nothing to do with that spoken by the
costermongers, is known in Seven Dials and elsewhere as the RHYMING
SLANG, _or the substitution of words and sentences which rhyme
with other words intended to be kept secret_. The chaunter’s Cant,
therefore, partakes of his calling, and he transforms and uses up into
a rough speech the various odds and ends of old songs, ballads, and
street nick-names, which are found suitable to his purpose. Unlike
nearly all other systems of Cant, the rhyming Slang is not founded
upon allegory; unless we except a few rude similes, thus—I’M AFLOAT is
the rhyming Cant for _boat_, SORROWFUL TALE is equivalent to _three
months in jail_, ARTFUL DODGER signifies a _lodger_, and a SNAKE IN THE
GRASS stands for a _looking-glass_—a meaning that would delight a fat
Chinaman, or a Collector of Oriental proverbs. But, as in the case of
the costers’ speech and the old gipsey-vagabond Cant, the chaunters and
patterers so interlard this rhyming Slang with their general remarks,
while their ordinary language is so smothered and subdued, that, unless
when they are professionally engaged and talking of their wares, they
might almost pass for foreigners.

From the inquiries I have made of various patterers and “paper
workers,” I learn that the rhyming Slang was introduced about twelve
or fifteen years ago. Numbering this class of oratorical and bawling
wanderers at twenty thousand, scattered over Great Britain, including
London and the large provincial towns, we thus see the number of
English vagabonds who converse in rhyme and talk poetry, although
their habitations and mode of life constitute a very unpleasant
Arcadia. These nomadic poets, like the other talkers of Cant or secret
languages, are stamped with the vagabond’s mark, and are continually
on the move. The married men mostly have lodgings in London, and come
and go as occasion may require. A few never quit London streets, but
the greater number tramp to all the large provincial fairs, and prefer
the MONKERY (country) to town life. Some transact their business in a
systematic way, sending a post-office order to the Seven Dials printer,
for a fresh supply of ballads or penny books, or to the SWAG SHOP, as
the case may be, for trinkets and gewgaws, to be sent on by rail to a
given town by the time they shall arrive there.

When any dreadful murder, colliery explosion, or frightful railway
accident has happened in a country district, three or four chaunters
are generally on the spot in a day or two after the occurrence, vending
and bawling “_A True and Faithful Account_,” &c., which “true and
faithful account” was concocted purely in the imaginations of the
successors of Catnach and Tommy Pitts,[58] behind the counters of their
printing shops in Seven Dials. And but few fairs are held in any part
of England without the patterer being punctually at his post, with
his nostrums, or real gold rings (with the story of the wager laid by
the gentleman—see FAWNEY BOUNCING, in the Dictionary), or save-alls
for candlesticks, or paste which, when applied to the strop, makes
the dullest razor keen enough to hack broom handles and sticks, and
after that to have quite enough sharpness left for splitting hairs, or
shaving them off the back of one of the clodhoppers’ hands, looking
on in amazement. And CHEAP JOHN, too, with his coarse jokes, and no
end of six-bladed knives, and pocket-books, containing information for
everybody, with pockets to hold money, and a pencil to write with in
the bargain, and a van stuffed with the cheap productions of Sheffield
and “Brummagem,”—he, too, is a patterer of the highest order, and
visits fairs, and can hold a conversation in the rhyming Slang.

Such is a rough description of the men who speak this jargon; and
simple and ridiculous as the vulgar scheme of a rhyming Slang may
appear, it must always be regarded as a curious fact in linguistic
history. In order that the reader’s patience may not be too much taxed,
only a selection of rhyming words has been given in the Glossary,—and
these for the most part, as in the case of the back Slang, are the
terms of everyday life, as used by this order of tramps and hucksters.

It must not be supposed, however, that the chaunter or patterer
confines himself entirely to this Slang when conveying secret
intelligence. On the contrary, although he speaks not a “leash of
languages,” yet is he master of the beggars’ Cant, and is thoroughly
“up” in street Slang. The following letter, written by a chaunter
to a gentleman who took an interest in his welfare, will show his
capabilities in this line.

  Dear Friend,[59]

  Excuse the liberty, since i saw you last i have not earned a thickun,
  we have had such a Dowry of Parny that it completely stumped or
  Coopered Drory the Bossmans Patter therefore i am broke up and not

  the price of 2 Gross of Tops, Dies, or Croaks, which is 7 shillings,
  of the above mentioned worthy and Sarah Chesham the Essex Burick for
  the Poisoning job, they are both to be topped at Springfield Sturaban
  on Tuesday next. i hope you will oblige me if you can for it will be
  the means of putting a Quid or a James in my Clye. i will call at
  your Carser on Sunday Evening next for an answer, for i want to Speel

THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SLANG, CANT, AND VULGAR LANGUAGE;

OR A LIST OF THE BOOKS WHICH HAVE BEEN CONSULTED IN COMPILING THIS
WORK, COMPRISING NEARLY EVERY KNOWN TREATISE UPON THE SUBJECT.


Slang has a literary history, the same as authorised language. More
than one hundred works have treated upon the subject in one form or
another,—a few devoting but a chapter, whilst many have given up their
entire pages to expounding its history and use. Old Harman, a worthy
man, who interested himself in suppressing and exposing vagabondism in
the days of good Queen Bess, was the first to write upon the subject.
Decker followed fifty years afterwards, but helped himself, evidently,
to his predecessor’s labours. Shakespere, Beaumont and Fletcher, Ben
Jonson, and Brome, each employed beggars’ Cant as part of the machinery
of their plays. Then came Head (who wrote “The English Rogue,” in 1680)
with a glossary of Cant words “used by the Gipseys.” But it was only a
reprint of what Decker had given sixty years before. About this time
authorised dictionaries began to insert vulgar words, labelling them
“Cant.” The Jack Sheppards and Dick Turpins of the early and middle
part of the last century made Cant popular, and many small works were
published upon the subject. But it was Grose, burly, facetious Grose,
who, in the year 1785, collected the scattered glossaries of Cant
and secret words, and formed one large work, adding to it all the
vulgar words and Slang terms used in his own day. I am aware that the
indelicacy and extreme vulgarity of the work renders it a disgrace to
its compiler, still we must admit that it is by far the most important
work which has ever appeared on street or popular language; indeed,
from its pages every succeeding work has, up to the present time, drawn
its contents. The great fault of Grose’s book consists in the author
not contenting himself with Slang and Cant terms, but the inserting
of every “smutty” and offensive word that could be raked out of the
gutters of the streets. However, Harman and Grose are, after all, the
only authors who have as yet treated the subject in an original manner,
or have written on it from personal inquiry.

AINSWORTH’S (William Harrison) Novels and Ballads. _London_, V.D.

  Some of this author’s novels, such as Rookwood and Jack Sheppard,
  abound in cant words, placed in the mouths of the highwaymen. The
  author’s ballads (especially “Nix my dolly pals fake away,”) have
  long been popular favourites.

ANDREWS’ (George) Dictionary of the Slang and Cant Languages, Ancient
and Modern, 12mo. _London_, 1809

  A sixpenny pamphlet, with a coloured frontispiece representing a
  beggar’s carnival.

A NEW DICTIONARY OF THE JAUNTING CREW, 12mo. N.D.

  Mentioned by John Bee in the Introduction to his Sportsman’s Slang
  Dictionary.

ASH’S (John, LL.D.) New and Complete Dictionary of the English
Language, 2 vols. 8vo. 1775

  Contains a great number of cant words and phrases.

BACCHUS AND VENUS; or, a Select Collection of near 200 of the most
Witty and Diverting Songs and Catches in Love and Gallantry, with Songs
in the Canting Dialect, with a DICTIONARY, _ explaining all Burlesque
and Canting Terms_, 12mo. 1738

  Prefixed is a curious woodcut frontispiece of a _Boozing Ken_. This
  work is scarce, and much prized by collectors. The Canting Dictionary
  appeared before, about 1710, with the initials B. E. on the title.
  It also came out afterwards, in the year 1751, under the title of
  the _Scoundrel’s Dictionary_,—a mere reprint of the two former
  impressions.

BAILEY’S (Nath.) Etymological English Dictionary, 2 vols, 8vo. 1737

  Contains a great many cant and vulgar words;—indeed, Bailey does not
  appear to have been very particular what words he inserted, so long
  as they were actually in use. A _Collection of Ancient and Modern
  Cant Words_ appears as an appendix to vol. ii. of this edition (3rd).

BANG-UP DICTIONARY, or the Lounger and Sportsman’s Vade Mecum,
containing a copious and correct Glossary of the Language of the Whips,
illustrated by a great variety of original and curious Anecdotes, 8vo.
1812

  A vulgar performance, consisting of pilferings from Grose, and
  made-up words with meanings of a degraded character.

BARTLETT’S Dictionary of Americanisms; a Glossary of Words and Phrases
colloquially used in the United States, 8vo. _New York_, 1859

  It is a curious fact connected with slang that a great number of
  vulgar words common in England are equally common in the United
  States; and when we remember that America began to people two
  centuries ago, and that these colloquialisms must have crossed the
  sea with the first emigrants, we can form some idea of the antiquity
  of popular or street language. Many words, owing to the caprices of
  fashion or society, have wholly disappeared in the parent country,
  whilst in the colonies they are yet heard. The words SKINK, to serve
  drink in company, and the old term MICHING or MEECHING, skulking or
  playing truant, for instance, are still in use in the United States,
  although nearly, if not quite, obsolete here.

BEAUMONT and FLETCHER’S Comedy of _The Beggar’s Bush_, 4to, 1661, or
any edition.

  Contains numerous cant words.

BEE’S (Jon.) Dictionary of the Turf, the Ring, the Chase, the Pit, the
Bon Ton, and the Varieties of Life, forming the completest and most
authentic Lexicon Balatronicum hitherto offered to the notice of the
Sporting World, by Jon. Bee [_i.e._ John Badcock], Esq., Editor of the
Fancy, Fancy Gazette, Living Picture of London, and the like of that,
12mo. 1823

  This author published books on Stable Economy under the name of
  Hinds. He was the sporting rival of Pierce Egan. Professor Wilson, in
  an amusing article in _Blackwood’s Magazine_, reviewed this work.

BEE’S (Jon.) Living Picture of London for 1828, and Stranger’s Guide
through the Streets of the Metropolis; shewing the Frauds, the Arts,
Snares, and Wiles of all descriptions of Rogues that everywhere abound,
12mo. 1828

  Professes to be a guide to society, high and low, in London, and to
  give an insight into the language of the streets.

BEE’S (Jon.) Sportsman’s Slang, a New Dictionary of Terms used in the
affairs of the Turf, the Ring, the Chase, and the Cockpit; with those
of Bon Ton and the Varieties of Life, forming a _Lexicon Balatronicum
et Macaronicum, &c._, 12mo, _plate_. _For the Author_, 1825

  The same as the preceding, only with an altered title. Both wretched
  performances, filled with forced and low wit.

BLACKGUARDIANA; or, Dictionary of Rogues, Bawds, &c., 8vo, WITH
PORTRAITS [by _James Caulfield_]. 1795

  This work, with a long and very vulgar title, is nothing but a
  reprint of _Grose_, with a few anecdotes of pirates, odd persons,
  &c., and some curious portraits inserted. It was concocted by
  Caulfield as a speculation, and published at _one guinea_ per copy;
  and, owing to the remarkable title, and the notification at the
  bottom, that “only a few copies were printed,” soon became scarce.
  For philological purposes it is not worth so much as any edition of
  Grose.

BOXIANA, or Sketches of Modern Pugilism, by Pierce Egan (an account of
the prize ring), 3 vols, 8vo. 1820

  Gives more particularly the cant terms of pugilism, but contains
  numerous (what were then styled) “flash” words.

BRANDON. Poverty, Mendicity, and Crime; or, the Facts, Examinations,
&c., upon which the Report was founded, presented to the House of Lords
by W. A. Miles, Esq., to which is added a _Dictionary of the Flash or
Cant Language, known to every Thief and Beggar_, edited by H. Brandon,
Esq., 8vo. 1839

  A very wretched performance.

BROME’S (Rich.) Joviall Crew; or the Merry Beggars. Presented in a
Comedie at the Cockpit, in Drury Lane, in the Year (4to.) 1652

  Contains many cant words similar to those given by Decker,—from whose
  works they were doubtless obtained.

BROWN’S (Rev. Hugh Stowell) Lecture on Manliness, 12mo. 1857

  Contains a few modern slang words.

BRYDGES’ (Sir Egerton) British Bibliographer, 4 vols, 8vo. 1810–14

  Vol ii., page 521, gives a list of cant words.

BULWER’S (Sir Edward Lytton) Paul Clifford. V.D.

  Contains numerous cant words.

BULWER’S (Sir Edward Lytton) Pelham. V.D.

  Contains a few cant terms.

BUTLER’S Hudibras, with Dr. Grey’s Annotations, 3 vols, 8vo. 1819

  Abounding in colloquial terms and phrases.

and Colloquial, or Cant, which are used at the University, _with
Illustrations_, 12mo. _Camb._, 1803

CANTING ACADEMY; or Villanies Discovered, wherein are shewn the
Mysterious and Villanous Practices of that Wicked Crew—Hectors,
Trapanners, Gilts, &c., with several new Catches and Songs; also
Compleat Canting Dictionary, 12mo., _frontispiece_. 1674

  Compiled by Richard Head.

CANTING; a Poem, interspersed with Tales and additional Scraps, post
8vo. 1814

  A few words may be gleaned from this rather dull poem.

CANTING DICTIONARY; comprehending all the Terms, Antient and Modern,
used in the several Tribes of Gypsies, Beggars, Shoplifters,
Highwaymen, Foot Pads, and all other Clans of Cheats and Villains,
with Proverbs, Phrases, Figurative Speeches, &c., to which is added a
complete Collection of Songs in the Canting Dialect, 12mo. 1725

  The title is by far the most interesting part of the work. A mere
  make-up of earlier attempts.

CAREW. Life and Adventures of Bamfylde Moore Carew, the King of the
Beggars, _with Canting Dictionary, portrait_, 8vo. 1791

  There are numerous editions of this singular biography. The Canting
  Dictionary is nothing more than a filch from earlier books.

CHARACTERISMS, or the Modern Age Displayed; being an attempt to expose
the Pretended Virtues of Both Sexes, 12mo (part i., Ladies; part ii.,
Gentlemen), _E. Owen_. 1750

  An anonymous work, from which some curious matter may be obtained.

CONYBEARE’S (Dean) Essay on Church Parties, reprinted from the
_Edinburgh Review_, No. CC., October, 1853, 12mo. 1858

  Several curious instances of religious or pulpit slang are given in
  this exceedingly interesting little volume.

COTTON’S (Charles) Genuine Poetical Works, 12mo. 1771

  Scarronides, or Virgil Travestie, being the first and fourth Books of
  Virgil’s Æneis, in English burlesque, 8vo, 1672, and other works by
  this author, contain numerous vulgar words now known as slang.

DECKER’S (Thomas) The Bellman of London; bringing to light the most
notorious villanies that are now practised in the Kingdome, 4to, black
letter. _London_, 1608

  Watt says this is the first book which professes to give an account
  of the canting language of thieves and vagabonds. But this is wrong,
  as will have been seen from the remarks on Harman, who collected the
  words of the vagabond crew half a century before.

DECKER’S (Thomas) Lanthorne and Candle-light, or the Bellman’s Second
Night’s Walke, in which he brings to light a brood of more strange
villanies than ever were to this year discovered, 4to. _London_, 1608–9

  This is a continuation of the former work, and contains the _Canter’s
  Dictionary_, and has a frontispiece of the London Watchman with his
  staff broken.

DECKER’S (Thomas) Gulls Hornbook, 4to. 1609

  “This work affords a greater insight into the fashionable follies and
  vulgar habits of Q. Elizabeth’s day than perhaps any other extant.”

DECKER’S (Thomas) O per se O, or a new Cryer of Lanthorne and
Candle-light, an Addition of the Bellman’s Second Night’s Walke, 4to,
black letter. 1612

  A lively description of London. Contains a Canter’s Dictionary,
  every word in which appears to have been taken from Harman without
  acknowledgment. This is the first work that gives the Canting Song,
  a verse of which is inserted at page 20 of the Introduction. This
  Canting Song was afterwards inserted in nearly all Dictionaries of
  Cant.

DECKER’S (Thomas) Villanies discovered by Lanthorne and Candle-light,
and the Helpe of a new Cryer called O per se O, 4to. 1616

  “With Canting Songs neuer before printed.”

DECKER’S (Thomas) English Villanies, eight several times prest to Death
by the Printers, but still reviving again, are now the eighth time (as
at the first) discovered by Lanthorne and Candle-light, &c., 4to. 1648

  The eighth edition of the “_Lanthorne and Candle-light_.”

DICTIONARY of all the Cant and Flash Languages, both Ancient and
Modern, 18mo. _Bailey_, 1790

DICTIONARY of all the Cant and Flash Languages, 12mo. _London_, 1797

DICTIONARY of the Canting Crew (Ancient and Modern), of Gypsies,
Beggars, Thieves, &c., 12mo. N.D. [1700]

DICTIONNAIRE des Halle, 12mo. _Bruxelles_, 1696

  This curious Slang Dictionary sold in the Stanley sale for £4 16s.

DUCANGE ANGLICUS.—The Vulgar Tongue: comprising Two Glossaries of
Slang, Cant, and Flash Words and Phrases used in London at the present
day, 12mo. 1857

  A silly and childish performance, full of blunders and
  contradictions. A second edition appeared during the past year.

DUNCOMBE’S Flash Dictionary of the Cant Words, Queer Sayings, and Crack
Terms now in use in Flash Cribb Society, 32mo, _coloured print_. 1820

DUNTON’S Ladies Dictionary, 8vo. _London_, 1694

  Contains a few cant words.

EGAN. Grose’s Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, with the
addition of numerous Slang Phrases, edited by Pierce Egan, 8vo. 1823

  The best edition of Grose, with many additions, including a Life of
  this celebrated antiquarian.

EGAN’S (Pierce) Life in London, 2 vols, thick 8vo, _with coloured
plates by Geo. Cruikshank, representing high and low life_. 18—

  Contains numerous cant, slang sporting, and vulgar words, supposed by
  the author to form the basis of conversation in life, high and low,
  in London.

ELWYN’S (Alfred L.) Glossary of supposed _Americanisms_—Vulgar and
Slang Words used in the United States, small 8vo. 1859

GENTLEMAN’S MAGAZINE, 8vo. N.D.

  “In a very early volume of this parent magazine were given a few
  pages, by way of sample, of a Slang Vocabulary, then termed Cant. If,
  as we suspect, this part of the Magazine fell to the share of Dr.
  Johnson, who was then its editor, we have to lament that he did not
  proceed with the design.”—_John Bee, in the Introduction to his Slang
  Dictionary_, 1825.

GENTLEMAN’S MAGAZINE, vol. xcii., p. 520.

  Mention made of slang.

GLOSSARIES of County Dialects. V.D.

  Many of these will repay examination, as they contain cant and slang
  words, wrongly inserted as provincial or old terms.

GOLDEN CABINET (The) of Secrets opened for Youth’s delightful Pastime,
in 7 parts, the last being the “City and Country Jester;” with a
Canting Dictionary, by Dr. Surman, 12mo. _London_, N.D. (1730)

  Contains some curious woodcuts.

GREENE’S (Robert) Notable Discovery of Coosnage, now daily practised by
sundry lewd persons called Conie-catchers and Crosse biters. Plainly
laying open those pernitious sleights that hath brought many ignorant
men to confusion. Writen for the general benefit of all Gentlemen,
Citizens, Aprentices, Country Farmers, and Yeomen, that may hap to
fall into the company of such coosening companions. With a delightful
discourse of the coosnage of Colliers, 4to, _with woodcuts_. _Printed
by John Wolfe_, 1591

  _The first edition._ A copy of another edition, supposed to be
  _unique_, is dated 1592. It was sold at the Heber sale.

GREENE’S (Robert) Groundworke of Conny-Catching, the manner of their
PEDLERS’ FRENCH, and the meanes to understand the same, with the
cunning slights of the Conterfeit Cranke. Done by a Justice of the
Peace of great Authoritie, 4to, _with woodcuts_. 1592

  Usually enumerated among Greene’s works, but it is only a reprint,
  with variations, of _Harman’s Caveat_, and of which Rowland complains
  in his Martin Markall. The _second_ and _third_ parts of this curious
  work were published in the same year. Two other very rare volumes by
  Greene were published—_The Defence of Cony-Catching_, 4to, in 1592,
  and THE BLACK BOOKES MESSENGER, in 1595. They both treat on the same
  subjects.

GROSE’S (Francis, generally styled _Captain_) Classical Dictionary of
the Vulgar Tongue, 8vo. 178—

  The much sought after FIRST EDITION, but containing nothing, as far
  as I have examined, which is not to be found in the _second_ and
  _third_ editions. As respects indecency, I find all the editions
  equally disgraceful. The Museum copy of the _First Edition_ is,
  I suspect, Grose’s own copy, as it contains numerous manuscript
  additions which afterwards went to form the second edition. Excepting
  the obscenities, it is really an extraordinary book, and displays
  great industry, if we cannot speak much of its morality. It is the
  well from which all the other authors—Duncombe, Caulfield, Clarke,
  Egan, &c. &c.—drew their vulgar outpourings, without in the least
  purifying what they had stolen.

HAGGART. Life of David Haggart, alias John Wilson, alias Barney M‘Coul,
written by himself while under sentence of Death, _curious frontispiece
of the Prisoner in Irons_, intermixed with all the Slang and Cant Words
of the Day, to which is added a Glossary of the same, 12mo. 1821

HALL’S (B. H.) Collection of College Words and Customs, 12mo.
_Cambridge_ (_U.S._), 1856

  Very complete. The illustrations are excellent.

HALLIWELL’S Archaic Dictionary, 2 vols, 8vo. 1855

  An invaluable work, giving the cant words used by Decker, Brome, and
  a few of those mentioned by Grose.

HARLEQUIN Jack Shepherd, with a Night Scene in Grotesque Characters,
8vo. (_About_ 1736)

  Contains Songs in the Canting dialect.

HARMAN’S (Thomas, Esq.) Caveat or Warening for Common Cursetors,
vulgarely called Vagabones, set forth for the utilitie and profit of
his naturall countrey, augmented and inlarged by the first author
thereof; whereunto is added the tale of the second taking of the
counterfeit Crank, with the true report of his behaviour and also
his punishment for his so dissembling, most marvellous to the hearer
or reader thereof, newly imprinted, 4to. _Imprinted at London, by H.
Middleton_, 1573

  Contains the earliest Dictionary of the Cant language. Four editions
  were printed—

  William Griffith 1566

  William Griffith 1567

  William Griffith 1567

  Henry Middleton, 1573

  What _Grose’s Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_ was to the authors of
  the earlier part of the present century, Harman’s was to the Deckers,
  and Bromes, and Heads of the seventeenth.

HARRISON’S (William) Description of the Island of Britain (prefixed to
Holinshed’s Chronicle), 2 vols, folio. 1577

  Contains an account of English vagabonds.

HAZLITT’S (William) Table Talk, 12mo (vol. ii. contains a chapter on
_Familiar Style_, with a notice on _Slang Terms_.) V.D.

HEAD’S (Richard) English Rogue, described in the Life of Meriton
Latroon, a Witty Extravagant, 4 vols., 12mo. _Frans. Kirkman_, 1671–80

  One of the many reprints of _Grose’s_ second edition, put forth under
  a fresh, and what was then considered more attractive title. It was
  given out in advertisements, &c., as a piece of puff, that it was
  edited by a Dr. H. Clarke, but it contains scarcely a line more than

LIBER VAGATORUM: Der Betler Orden, 4to.

  The first edition of this book appears to have been printed at
  Augsburg, by Erhard Öglin, or Ocellus, about 1514,—a small quarto
  of twelve leaves. It was frequently reprinted at other places in
  Germany; and in 1528 there appeared an edition at Wittemberg, with
  a preface by Martin Luther, who says that the “Rotwelsche Sprach,”
  the cant language of the beggars, comes from the Jews, as it
  contains many Hebrew words, as anyone who understands that language
  may perceive. This book is divided into three parts, or sections;
  the first gives a special account of the several orders of the
  “Fraternity of Vagabonds;” the second, sundry “_notabilia_” relating
  to the different classes of beggars previously described; and the
  third consists of a “Rotwelsche Vocabulary,” or “Canting Dictionary.”
  There is a long notice of the “Liber Vagatorum” in the “Wiemarisches
  Jahrbuch,” 10te, Band, 1856. Mayhew, in his “London Labour,” states
  that many of our cant words are derived from the Jew fences. It is
  singular that a similar statement should have been made by Martin
  Luther more than three centuries before.

the nomadic tribes, _i.e._, “Whether it be that in the mere act of
wandering, there is a greater determination of blood to the surface of
the body, and consequently a less quantity sent to the brain.”—_London

[6] The word SLANG, as will be seen in the chapter upon that subject,
is purely a Gipsey term, although now-a-days it refers to low or
vulgar language of any kind,—other than cant. SLANG and GIBBERISH in
the Gipsey language are synonymous; but, as English adoptions, have
meanings very different from that given to them in their original.

[7] The vulgar tongue consists of two parts: the first is the CANT
Language; the second, those burlesque phrases, quaint allusions,
and nick names for persons, things, and places, which, from long
uninterrupted usage, are made classical by prescription.—_Grose’s
Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_, 1st edition, 1785.

[8] “Outlandish people calling themselves _Egyptians_.” 1530.

[9] In those instances, indicated by a *, it is impossible to say
whether or not we are indebted to the Gipseys for the terms. DAD, in
_Welsh_, also signifies a father. CUR is stated to be a mere term of
reproach, like “Dog,” which in all European languages has been applied
in an abusive sense. Objections may also be raised against GAD and
MAUND.

[10] JABBER, I am reminded, may be only another form of GABBER, GAB,
very common in Old English, from the _Anglo-Saxon_, GÆBBAN.

[11] This very proverb was mentioned by a young Gipsey to Crabb, a few
years ago.—_Gipseys’ Advocate_, p. 14.

[15] It is easy to see how _cheat_ became synonymous with “fraud,” when
we remember that it was one of the most common words of the greatest
class of cheats in the country.

[16] I am reminded by an eminent philologist that the origin of QUEER
is seen in the _German_, QUER, crooked,—hence “odd.” I agree with
this etymology, but still have reason to believe that the word was
_first_ used in this country in a cant sense. Is it mentioned any where
as a respectable term before 1500? If not, it had a vulgar or cant
introduction into this country.

_Decker_ and _Brome_.

[22] This is a curious volume, and is worth from one to two guineas.
The Canting Dictionary was afterwards reprinted, word for word, with

wylde Roge is he that is _borne_ a roge,” will perhaps explain this
seeming anomaly.

[30] Sometimes, as appears from the following, the names of persons and
houses are written instead. “In almost every one of the padding-kens,
or low lodging-houses in the country, there is a list of walks pasted
up over the kitchen mantel piece. Now at St. Albans, for instance, at
the ——, and at other places, there is a paper stuck up in each of the
kitchens. This paper is headed “WALKS OUT OF THIS TOWN,” and underneath
it is set down the names of the villages in the neighbourhood at which
a beggar may call when out on his walk, and they are so arranged as
to allow the cadger to make a round of about six miles each day, and
return the same night. In many of these papers there are sometimes
twenty walks set down. No villages that are in any way “gammy” [bad]
are ever mentioned in these papers, and the cadger, if he feels
inclined to stop for a few days in the town, will be told by the
lodging-house keeper, or the other cadgers that he may meet there, what
gentlemen’s seats or private houses are of any account on the walk that
he means to take. The names of the good houses are not set down in the
paper for fear of the police.”—_Mayhew_, vol. i., p. 418.

[40] Introduction to _Bee’s Sportsman’s Dictionary_, 1825.

[41] The Gipseys use the word Slang as the Anglican synonyme for
Romany, the continental (or rather Spanish) term for the Cingari or
Gipsey tongue. _Crabb_, who wrote the _Gipsies’ Advocate_ in 1831,
thus mentions the word:—“This language [Gipsey] _called by themselves_
_Slang_, or _Gibberish_, invented, as they think, by their forefathers
for secret purposes, is not merely the language of one or a few of
these wandering tribes, which are found in the European nations, but is
adopted by the vast numbers who inhabit the earth.”

[42] The word SLANG assumed various meanings amongst costermongers,
beggars, and vagabonds of all orders. It was, and is still, used to
express cheating by false weights, a raree show, for retiring by a back
door, for a watch-chain, and for their secret language.

[43] _North_, in his _Examen_, p. 574, says, “I may note that the
rabble first changed their title, and were called the mob in the
assemblies of this [Green Ribbon] club. It was their beast of burden,
and called first _mobile vulgus_, but fell naturally into the
contraction of one syllable, and ever since is become proper English.”
In the same work, p. 231, the disgraceful origin of SHAM is given.

[44] It is rather singular that this popular journal should have
contained a long article on _Slang_ a short time ago.

[45] The writer is quite correct in instancing this piece of
fashionable twaddle. The mongrel formation is exceedingly amusing to a
polite Parisian.

[46] Savez vous cela?

[47] From an early period politics and partyism have attracted unto
themselves quaint Slang terms. Horace Walpole quotes a party nickname
of February, 1742, as a Slang word of the day:—“The Tories declare
against any further prosecution, if Tories there are, for now one
hears of nothing but the BROAD-BOTTOM; it is the reigning Cant word,
and means the taking all parties and people, indifferently, into the
ministry.” Thus BROAD-BOTTOM in those days was Slang for _coalition_.

[48] This is more especially an amusement with medical students, and is
comparatively unknown out of London.

[49] _Edinburgh Review_, October, 1853.

[50] A term derived from the _Record Newspaper_, the exponent of this
singular section of the Low, or so called Evangelical Church.

[51] A preacher is said, in this phraseology, to be OWNED, when he
makes many converts, and his converts are called his SEALS.

[52] “All our newspapers contain more or less colloquial words; in
fact, there seems no other way of expressing certain ideas connected
with passing events of every-day life, with the requisite force and
piquancy. In the English newspapers the same thing is observable, and
certain of them contain more of the class denominated Slang words than

=A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant=, and VULGAR WORDS, used at the
present day in the Streets of London; the Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge; the Houses of Parliament; the Dens of St. Giles; and the
Palaces of St. James: preceded by a HISTORY OF CANT AND VULGAR LANGUAGE
_from the time of Henry VIII., showing its connection with the_ GIPSEY
TONGUE; with GLOSSARIES OF TWO SECRET LANGUAGES, _spoken by the
Wandering Tribes of London, the Costermongers, and the Patterers_. BY
A LONDON ANTIQUARY. Fcp. 8vo. _extra cloth_. WITH A CURIOUS WOODCUT,
“=A Cadger’s Map of a Beggar’s District=,” _and Explanation of_ THE
HIEROGLYPHICS USED BY VAGABONDS.

  “Rabble-charming words, which carry so much wild-fire wrapt up in
  them.”—SOUTH.

☞ THE SECOND EDITION, entirely rewritten, with more than TWO THOUSAND
_additional_ words, and a mass of fresh information not included in the
_first_ issue.

This interesting work is an important contribution to popular
philology, as it chronicles for the first time nearly FIVE THOUSAND
WORDS used by persons of every denomination in common conversation,
MOST OF WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN NO ENGLISH DICTIONARY whatever. The
origin of many cant and slang words is also traced.


OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.

  “The author has spared no pains to make his little volume perfect,
  both by collecting original and unused material from costermongers,
  vagabonds, and tramps, and by consulting nearly all writers who
  have gone before. * * * The author divides SLANG into _historical_,
  _fashionable_, _parliamentary_, _military and dandy_, _university_,
  _religious_, _legal_, _literary_, _theatrical_, _civic_, _money_,
  _shopkeepers’ and workmen’s slang_,—the _slang apologies for oaths_,
  and the _slang of drunkenness_. The Freemasonry of tramps and
  beggars, and the hieroglyphics they use, is an interesting part of
  vagabond history that requires, if possible, further investigation.
  * * * His work is carefully and honestly performed, and we hope that
  the writer will read our remarks [five full columns] in a proper
  spirit, and, in the latest slang of the present hour, will “TAKE THEM
  ON HIS HEAD LIKE A BIRD.”—_Athenæum._

  “Extremely interesting. This little volume is evidently the result of
  a great deal of labour, as all works must be that are, in the chief
  part, collected directly by the observation and care of the author:
  and this we believe is the case in the present instance. The author
  we suspect to be identical with the publisher, and if so, he has
  had great opportunity by his possession of a large amount of scarce
  tracts, ballads, and street publications, of informing himself of the
  language of the vagabond portion of our population.”—_Leader._

  “There is a certain amount of interest in preserving the origin of
  slang words as a record of existing manners, and of those strange
  popular sayings which have a rapid and almost universal popularity,
  and then fade away as rapidly. The combinations of language in cant
  are often curious. The London Antiquary informs us that the cant for
  a public house at the present day is _suck cassa_,—pure Saxon and
  pure Spanish.”—_Saturday Review._

  “This is by far the most complete work upon a curious subject which
  has yet been compiled—a dictionary of more than three thousand
  words in current use in our streets and alleys, lanes and by-ways,
  from which the learned lexicographers have turned aside with
  contempt.”—_Critic._

  “This new Dictionary of our English cant and slang is _full_, and
  may be received as an amusing and suggestive little book of common
  knowledge into any household. Indecency has been omitted from its
  pages.”—_Examiner._

  “The ‘London Antiquary’ has certainly taken up a very curious and
  interesting branch of linguistic research.”—_Notes and Queries._

  “An instructive as well as amusing work. The author may be
  congratulated upon the successful issue of his labours in the field
  of vagabond and unrecognised speech.”—_Titan_ in an article of _ten
  pages_.

  “An amusing work, and a most useful and valuable contribution to the
  study of words. It is absolutely necessary to all those who in fast
  life would “mind their P’s and Q’s,” as well as to the readers of our
  newspaper and periodical literature.”—_Montrose Review._

  “We do not wonder that of so quaint and entertaining a compilation a
  new edition should so soon have been demanded.”—_Globe._

  “Contains a good deal of curious historical and anecdotical
  information, and is altogether a well got up, well edited, and
  amusing little volume.”—_Shipping Gazette._

  “Evinces a great amount of industry.”—_Morning Star._

THE CHOICEST HUMOROUS POETRY OF THE AGE.

=The Biglow Papers. By James Russell= LOWELL. (Alluded to by John
Bright in the House of Commons.)

WITH AN ILLUSTRATION BY GEORGE CRUIKSHANK.

⁂ _This Edition has been Edited with additional Notes explanatory of
the persons and subjects mentioned therein._

  “The rhymes are as startling and felicitous as any in ‘Hudibras.’
  ‘Sam Slick’ is a mere pretender in comparison.”—_Blackwood’s
  Magazine._

  “The fun of the ‘Biglow Papers’ is quite equal to the fun of the
  ‘Ingoldsby Legends.’ This is the real doggerel, the Rabelaiesque of
  poetry.”—_Fraser._

☞ There is an edition of this work extant, hastily got up after my
own was announced, edited by Mr. Hughes, the author of _Tom Brown’s
School Days_. It gives an introduction, long and occasionally amusing,
but of not the least value in explaining to the _English_ reader the
peculiarities of the work. The _Globe_ pointed out this sad defect
in reviewing the present edition:—“The copy beside us,” remarks the
writer, “is apparently edited and published by Mr. Hotten, who gives
a preface—which has the rare merit of explaining exactly what the
ordinary English reader requires to know of satirical political poems,
written in the Yankee dialect, touching the Mexican war, and the
extension of the slave states—and of attempting to explain nothing
else.”—_Globe_, Dec. 8, 1859.

Writings.

⁂ Also, a fine paper Edition, cloth, neat, with a PHOTOGRAPHIC PORTRAIT
(_the only one known to have been taken_) by MAULL and POLYBLANK, price
2s. 6d.

☞ Includes Anecdotes of SYDNEY SMITH, MOORE, ROGERS, and LORD JEFFREY;
and gives numerous examples of Lord Macaulay’s extraordinary memory and
great powers of conversation.

  “A brilliant sketch of the great historian, containing particulars
  of his youthful compositions, which are new and deeply
  interesting.”—_Herald._

  “We regard the little work before us as a very opportune publication.
  The author has brought together such a mass of facts, sketches, and
  anecdotes, illustrative of the character and mind of Lord Macaulay,
  that the book is very valuable as supplying, in a small compass, a
  faithful and vivid account of the great historian.”—_Bradford Review._

  “An interesting account of a man who was an ornament to our nation.
  Of the extraordinary capacity and availability of his memory many
  wonderful stories are told.”—_Evangelical Repository._

  “This work is well timed. Here we really have all that is known
  concerning the great man. The little book brings together with
  much dexterity and success very various and very scattered
  materials. We have been peculiarly interested in the details of the
  late illustrious Baron’s youthful productions. Never before has
  Wordsworth’s famous couplet, “The boy is father of the man,” received
  so vivid illustration. It is earnestly to be hoped that the whole of
  these early papers, and his inedited speeches and addresses written
  and spoken in the flush of his powers, and with all the wealth of
  illustration that so distinguished him, shall be collected. Why not
  at once by the writer of the present brilliant sketch? We know not
  who he is, but he is a man of no common powers. He has evidently,
  too, put his heart into his book. It thrills and throbs with reverent
  love towards the man. We like exceedingly his fresh, generous,
  glowing style; and not less his genial, gossipy way of telling the
  many anecdotes with which his pages sparkle.”—_Advertiser._

  “Valuable from the original matter and anecdotes it gives concerning
  Macaulay’s youthful productions.”—_Leader._

  “We hear Mr. Hotten’s little book on Macaulay is a success. Ten
  thousand copies sold within a few days!”—_Critic._

WITH ILLUSTRATIONS ON WOOD BY THE AUTHOR, COLOURED AND PLAIN.

⁂ The critiques which have appeared upon this amusing little work have
been uniformly favourable. The _Athenæum_ pronounces it a perfect
model of successful antiquarian exposition, readable from the first
line to the last. The _Art Journal_ devotes a considerable space to
the little work, and congratulates the author upon his success. The
_Leader_ contributes two full columns of eulogy. The _Builder_ directs
its readers to purchase it. The _Critic_ says, in a long article,
that it thoroughly explains who these old Giants were, the position
they occupied in popular mythology, the origin of their names, and a
score of other matters, all of much interest in throwing a light upon
fabulous portions of our history.

=Garland of Pepysian Ballads, Historical=, ROMANTIC, and HUMOROUS, some
illustrating Shakespere, edited by EDWARD F. RIMBAULT, Esq., LL.D.

It is well known that the unfortunate regulation imposed by Pepys, the
celebrated diarist, that his Manuscripts and Books should never be
examined save in the presence of a Fellow of the College at Cambridge
where they are preserved, has hitherto alone prevented the collecting
and publishing some of the more interesting of these world-renowned
Ballads and Songs. The difficulty, however, has been surmounted by
Dr. Rimbault, aided by the authorities of Magdalene College; and the
lovers of our charming old popular poetry will be glad to know that
a _Garland_ of these Balladian ditties is in course of publication.
The work will be preceded by an Introduction on Ballad Lore, Ballad
Writers, and Ballad Printers, giving some new and interesting
particulars gathered from “old bookes,” and other sources, hitherto
unexplored. The publisher would state that the work will be beautifully
printed by Whittingham, and that it will be adorned by a curious
woodcut facsimile frontispiece.

guarantee to the purchaser that the facsimile is exact, the publisher
need only state that Sir Frederick Madden has permitted copies to hang
for public inspection upon the walls of the Manuscript Department
in the British Museum. It was executed by Mr. Harrison, under whose
auspices the splendid work on the Knights of the Garter was produced
some years ago.

=The Book of Vagabonds and Beggars=, (LIBER VAGATORUM: _Der Betler
Orden_), with a Vocabulary of their Language (_Rotwelsche Sprach_);
edited, with Preface, by MARTIN LUTHER, in the year 1528. NOW FIRST
TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH, WITH NOTES, by JOHN CAMDEN HOTTEN.

⁂ This very singular work is comparatively unknown in this country.
The first edition appears to have been printed at Augsburg, by Erhard
Öglin, or Ocellus, as early as 1514—a small quarto of twelve leaves. It
was frequently reprinted at other places in Germany; and in 1528 there
appeared an edition at Wittemberg, with a Preface by Martin Luther,
from which the present translation has been made. The work is divided
into three parts or sections; the first gives a special account of the
several orders of the “Fraternity of Vagabonds;” the second, sundry
_notabilia_ relating to the different classes of beggars previously
described; and the third consists of a CANTING DICTIONARY. It is
singular that more than three centuries ago Martin Luther should have
declared that the cant language of beggars comes from the Hebrews,
and that in our own time a similar statement should be made by Mayhew
in his _London Labour_. Mayhew says that many of the most expressive
street terms in every day use by London and provincial vagabonds are
derived from the Jew _Fences_.

=Letters of the Marchioness Broglio Solari=, one of the Maids of
Honour to the Princess Lamballe, &c.; with a Sketch of her Life, and
Recollections of Celebrated Characters (intended to have been sold at
5s.)

The Marchioness Broglio Solari was the natural grand-daughter of Lord
Hyde Clarendon, and consequently one of the collateral branches of the
Queens Mary and Ann, and their grand-father, the great Chancellor of
England. She played an important part in the French Revolution; was the
friend of Emperors and Princes; was intimately acquainted with George
the Fourth, Burke, Sheridan, Madame de Stael, the Duke of Wellington,
Sir Robert Peel, Sir H. Davy, Paganini, &c., of most of whom she gives
characteristic anecdotes. The Marchioness endured many troubles, was
robbed of her fortune, and for some time obtained her living as an
actress at the theatres of London and Dublin. This work was published
by an intimate friend, and the entire impression (with the exception
of a few copies) passed into the hands of the family. It is believed
that only 150 copies were printed. The book (by those who know of its
existence) has always been considered as a _suppressed work_.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
