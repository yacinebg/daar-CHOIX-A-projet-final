Preface.


Why has the beneficent Creator scattered over the face of the earth such
a profusion of beautiful flowers--flowers by the thousand and million,
in every land--from the tiny snowdrop that gladdens the chill spring of
the north, to the gorgeous magnolia that flaunts in the sultry regions
of the tropics? Why is it that every landscape has its appropriate
flowers, every nation its national flowers, every rural home its home
flowers? Why do flowers enter and shed their perfume over every scene of
life, from the cradle to the grave? Why are flowers made to utter all
voices of joy and sorrow in all varying scenes, from the chaplet that
adorns the bride to the votive wreath that blooms over the tomb?

It is for no other reason than that flowers have in themselves a real
and natural significance. They have a positive relation to man, his
sentiments, passions, and feelings. They correspond to actual emotions.
They have their mission--a mission of love and mercy. They have their
language, and from the remotest ages this language has found its
interpreters.

In the East the language of flowers has been universally understood and
applied “time out of mind.” Its meaning finds a place in their poetry
and in all their literature, and it is familiarly known among the
people. In Europe it has existed and been recognised for long ages among
the people, although scarcely noticed by the literati until a
comparatively recent period. Shakspeare, however, whom nothing escaped
which was known to the people, exhibits his intimate acquaintance with
the language of flowers in his masterly delineation of the madness of
Ophelia.

Recent writers in all languages recognise the beauty and propriety of
this language to such an extent, that an acquaintance with it has now
become indispensable as a part of a polished education.

Our little volume is devoted to the explanation of this beautiful
language. We have made it as complete as our materials and limits would
permit. We present it to our readers in the humble hope that we shall
increase the means of elegant and innocent enjoyment by our “Floral
Offering.”

MEZEREON.... _Coquetry--Desire to please._


This shrub, clothed in its showy garb, appears amidst the snow, like an
imprudent and coquettish female, who, though shivering with cold, wears
her spring attire in the depth of winter. The stalk of this shrub is
covered with a dry bark, which gives it the appearance of dead wood.
Nature, to hide this deformity, has encircled each of its sprays with a
wreath of red flowers, terminating in a tuft of leaves. These flowers
give out a peculiar and offensive smell.

  You oftentimes can mark upon the street
    The gilded toy whom fashion idolizes;
  Heartless and fickle, swelled with self-conceit,
    Avoiding alway what good sense advises.
Who flutters like the butterfly while burns his sun,
Nor afterwards is missed when life is done.

SNOWDROP. ... _Hope._


The Snowdrop is looked upon as the herald of the approach of
flower-wreathed Spring. The north winds howl; the naked branches of the
trees are white with frost; the earth is carpeted with the virgin snow;
the feathered musicians are silent; and stern Winter’s icy hand chills
the rivulet till it ceases to murmur. At this season, a tender flower
springs up amid the snow, expands its blossoms, and leads thought to the
verdant hours to come. This beautiful sign of awakening Nature may aptly
be considered as the emblem of Hope.

      A beauteous gem appears.
    All weak and wan, with head inclined,
      Its parent breast the drifted snow,
    It trembles, while the ruthless wind
    Bends its slim form; the tempest lowers,
    Its emerald eye drops crystal showers

    “Why do you call the Snowdrop pale,
      Our first of flowerets bright?
    For the Christmas Rose came long before,
      So did the Aconite.”
    I know the yellow Aconite;
      I know the Christmas Rose:
    But neither one nor other e’er
      Within my garden grows.
    They seem to me presumptuous things,
      That rudely hurry on,
    And struggle for the precedence
      A fairer flower hath won.
    When I was but a wee, wee thing,
      A young Snowdrop I nursed,
    And I loved it when they told me how
      It always blossomed first.
    I marked its tiny, trembling stem,
      And dainty little bell,
    And, oh! so tenderly enjoyed
      Its faint, delicious smell.
    It was not only fair and sweet,
      ’Twas the first flower that came;
    So said they then, and there is none
      I could love now the same.
    The Aconite may deck with gold
      Its merry little face--
    The Christmas Rose at Christmas bloom,
      But none can fill _her_ place.
    Within my garden’s small domain
      The Snowdrop still shall find
    Herself the earliest flower. She leads,
      The others come behind.
    And, lo! above the heaving mould
      The clustering bells hang here;
    Like foam upon the storm-black wave,
      Or pearls in Ethiop’s ear.
    And I know where they’re crowding thick,
      With none their wealth to note;--
    All o’er that woody isle, that lies
      Girt by the ancient moat.
    There, under tall, dark crested firs,
      The Snowdrops spring each year;
    And shed about that gloomy place
      A lightness pale and clear.
    A grand old Manor House once stood
      On that dim moated isle;
    But long years since have floated by,
      And its story died the while.
    Yet roses, cultured ones, run wild,
      And fruits, grown rough and sour,
    That linger still around, tell tales
      Of garden and of bower.
    And so the Snowdrops may have dwelt
      In borders neat and trim,
    And gentle beings tended them,
      Though now all’s drear and dim.
    The brave and beautiful have died,
      Not e’en a name is known:--
    Time hath laid low the stately house,--
      Ye cannot find a stone.
    But still there runneth brightly there
      The little sedgy stream
    Into the moat, that lieth still
      And shadowy as a dream.
    And still there groweth plenteously
      The fragile Snowdrop’s bell:--
    Oh, human pride! that thou wouldst list
      The tale these small things tell!

    Half-buried in the drifted snow,
      Lay sleeping on the frozen ground,
    Not heeding how the wind did blow,
      Bitter and bleak on all around:
    She gazed on Spring, who at her feet
    Was looking on the snow and sleet.
    Spring sighed, and through the driving gale
      Her warm breath caught the falling snow,
    And from the flakes a flower as pale
      Did into spotless whiteness blow.
    Hope, smiling, saw the blossom fall,
      And watched its root strike in the earth:
    “I will that flower the Snowdrop call,”
      Said Hope, “in memory of its birth:
    And through all ages it shall be
    In reverence held, for love of me.”
    “And ever from my hidden bowers,”
      Said Spring, “it first of all shall go,
    And be the herald of the flowers,
      To warn away the sheeted snow.
    Its mission done, then by thy side
      All summer long it shall remain.
    While other flowers I scatter wide,
      O’er every hill, and wood, and plain,
    This shall return, and ever be
    A sweet companion, Hope, for thee.”
    Hope stooped and kissed her sister Spring,
      And said, “For hours, when thou art gone,
    I’m left alone without a thing
      That I can fix my heart upon:
    ’Twill cheer me many a lonely hour,
      And in the future I shall see
    Those who would sink raised by that flower;
      They’ll look on it, then think of thee:
    And many a sadful heart shall sing,
    The Snowdrop bringeth Hope and Spring.”

PRIMROSE. ... _Early Grief._


The Primrose is one of the earliest flowers of spring. It was anciently
called Paralisos, the name of a beautiful youth, who died of grief for
the loss of his betrothed Melicerta, and was metamorphosed by his
parents into this flower, which has since been a favourite of the poets.

ALMOND BLOSSOM. ... _Indiscretion._


The Almond tree is the first of the trees to put forth its blossoms,
when spring breathes the breath of life through nature. It has been made
the emblem of indiscretion, from flowering so early that frosts too
often give a death-chill to the precocious germs of its fruit. In
ancient times, the abundance of blossoms upon the Almond tree was
considered to promise a fruitful season. The following is the fabulous
account of the origin of this tree:--Demophoon, son of Theseus and
Phædra, in returning from the siege of Troy, was thrown by a storm on
the shores of Thrace, where then reigned the beautiful Phyllis. The
young queen graciously received the prince, fell in love with him, and
became his wife. When recalled to Athens by his father’s death,
Demophoon promised to return in a month, and fixed the day. The loving
Phyllis counted the hours of his absence, and, at last, the appointed
day arrived. Nine times she repaired to the shore; but, losing all hope
of his return, she died of grief, and was converted into an Almond tree.
Soon afterwards, Demophoon returned. Overwhelmed with sorrow, he offered
a sacrifice at the sea-side, to appease the manes of his bride. The
Almond tree instantly put forth its blossoms, and seemed to sympathize
with his repentance.

CROCUS. ... _Youth._


The Crocus is one of the earliest of the spring flowers, and, therefore,
a fit emblem of the spring of life. It is a small flower, of variegated
hues; the principal being purple, yellow, and white. The _Crocus
Vernus_, or Spring Crocus, is a wild flower now in various parts of
England, though not considered to be really a native of the country. We
learn from the favourite writers, Mr. and Mrs. Howitt, that they are
plentiful about Nottingham, “gleaming at a distance like a perfect flood
of lilac, and tempting very many little hearts, and many graver ones
too, to go out and gather.”

      And two they’re looking out;
    I love them when the spreading field
      Is purple all about.
    I loved them in the by-gone years
      Of childhood’s thoughtless laughter,
    When I marvelled why the flowers came first,
      And the leaves the season after.
    I loved them then, I love them now--
      The gentle and the bright;
    I love them for the thoughts they bring
      Of spring’s returning light;
    When, first-born of the waking earth,

      The hope-invested year.

ALOE.... _Grief_.


The Aloe is attached to the soil by very feeble roots; it delights to
grow in the wilderness, and its taste is extremely bitter. Thus grief
separates us from earthly things, and fills the heart with bitterness.
These magnificent and monstrous plants are found in barbarous Africa:
they grow upon rocks, in dry sand under a burning atmosphere. Some have
leaves six feet long, and armed with long spires. From the centre of
these leaves shoots up a slender stem covered with flowers.

    Let me take thy hand in mine,

WORMWOOD. ... _Absence._


Wormwood is the bitterest of plants; and absence, according to La
Fontaine, is the worst of evils. Those in whose anxious breasts the
“flame divine” is burning, will agree with the French author in his
assertion. To be absent from one we love is to carry a vacant chamber in
the heart, which naught else can fill.

    When thou shalt yield to memory’s power,
    And let her fondly lead thee o’er
    The scenes that thou hast past before,
    To absent friends and days gone by,--
    Then should these meet thy pensive eye,
    A true memento may they be
    Of one whose bosom owes to thee
    So many hours enjoyed in gladness,
    That else perhaps had passed in sadness,
    And many a golden dream of joy,
    Untarnished and without alloy.
    Oh, still my fervent prayer will be,
    “Heaven’s choicest blessings rest on thee.”

VIOLET.... _Modest Worth_.


The Violet has always been a favourite theme of admiration among
visitors of Parnassus. Its quiet beauty and love of retired spots have
ever made it the emblem of true worth that shrinks from parade. It is
one of the first children of spring, and awakens pleasing emotions in
the breast of the lover of the beautiful, as he strolls through the
meadows in the season of joy. Ion, the Greek name of this flower, is
traced by some etymologists to Ia, the daughter of Midas, who was
betrothed to Atys, and changed by Diana into a Violet, to hide her from
Apollo.

    Gleams over the hawthorn and frail woodbine,
      Moss, deep and green,
      Lies thick, between
    The plots where we Violet-flowers are seen.

      I often pass that way, and look on them,

    My heart doth love such humble things; but I
      Esteem them more than robe or diadem
    Of haughty kings. A babe, or bird, or flower

DAISY.... _Innocence_.


Shakspeare speaks of the Daisy as the flower

    Whose white investments figure innocence;

and succeeding poets have generally used it as the image of that pure
quality. Fable informs us that the Daisy owes its origin to Belides, one
of the Dryads, who were supposed to preside over meadows and pastures.
While dancing on the turf with Ephigeus, whose suit she encouraged, she
attracted the admiration of Vertumnus, the deity who presided over
orchards; and, to escape from him, she was transformed into the humble
flower, the Latin name of which is Bellis. The ancient English name of
the flower was Day’s Eye, of which Daisy is a corruption. In Ossian’s
poems, the Daisy is called the flower of the new-born--most expressive
of innocence.

      While lovers sang each other’s praises,
    As in embowered lanes they wooed,
      Or on some bank white o’er with Daisies:
    While Love went by with muffled feet,
    Singing, “The Daisies they are sweet.”
    Unfettered then he roamed abroad,
      And as he willed it past the hours--
    Now lingering idly by the road,
      Now loitering by the wayside flowers;
    For what cared he about the morrow?
      Too young to sigh, too old to fear--

    Taking no note of space nor time,
      Through flowers, the banks adorning,
    Still rolling on, with silver chime,
      In star-clad night and golden morning.
    So went Love on, through cold and heat,
    Singing, “The Daisy’s ever sweet.”
    ’Twas then the flowers were haunted

LILAC.... _First Emotions of Love_.


The freshness of the verdure of the Lilac; the flexibility of its
branches; the profusion of its flowers; their transitory beauty and
their soft hues,--all remind us of those emotions which embellish
beauty, and throw such a light around our youthful hours. It is said
that Van Spaendonc himself threw down his pencil on viewing a group of
Lilacs. Nature seems to have delighted in creating its delicate
clusters, which astonish by their beauty and variety. The fragrance of
the flowers is even more gratifying than their beauty.

TULIP.... _Declaration of Love_.


The Tulip is an extraordinary favourite in many parts of Europe and
Asia; and, in Holland and Turkey, the most extravagant prices are paid
for fine specimens. On account of the elegance of its form, the beauty
of its colours, and its want of fragrance and other useful qualities,
this flower has been considered as an appropriate symbol of a female who
possesses no recommendation but a beautiful appearance. In the East, the
Tulip is employed as the emblem by which a lover makes known his passion
to his mistress; as the Tulip expresses the idea that he has a face all
fire and a heart all coal.

CYPRESS.... _Mourning_.


The ancients consecrated the Cypress to the Fates, the Furies and Pluto.
They placed it near tombs. The people of the East retain the same custom
in the decoration of their cemeteries. The Turks plant the Cypress at
the head and at the foot of the graves. According to Ovid, the Cypress
derived its name from Cyparissos, an especial friend of Apollo’s, who,
in grief at having inadvertently killed a favourite stag of his, prayed
the gods that his mourning might be made perpetual, and was changed into
a Cypress tree, the branches of which were thenceforward used at
funerals.

WALL-FLOWER.... _Fidelity in Adversity_.


This flower derives its name from the circumstance of its growing upon
old walls, the casements and battlements of ancient castles, and among

of Wall-flowers, as the emblem of an affection which is proof against

HAWTHORN.... _Hope_.


Various significations have been given to the Hawthorn. Among the Turks,
a branch of it expresses the wish of a lover to receive a kiss from the
object of his affection. Among the ancient Greeks, the Hawthorn was a
symbol of conjugal union; its blossomed boughs were carried about at
their wedding festivities, and the newly-married couple were even
lighted to their bridal chamber with torches made of its wood. In
England, the Hawthorn is used in the sports of May-days, and is,
therefore, frequently called May. There is a proverb among the rural
inhabitants of that country, that a “store of haws portend cold
winters.” Though the Hawthorn is quoted as the emblem of Hope, it must
be considered more particularly as the lover’s hope.

    HOW MAY WAS FIRST MADE.

    As Spring upon a silver cloud
      Lay looking on the world below,
    Watching the breezes as they bowed
      The buds and blossoms to and fro,
    She saw the fields with Hawthorns walled:
      Said Spring, “New buds I will create.”
    She to a Flower-Spirit called,
      Who on the month of May did wait,
    And bade her fetch a Hawthorn-spray,
    That she might make the buds of May.
    Said Spring, “The grass looks green and bright,
      The Hawthorn-hedges too are green,
    I’ll sprinkle them with flowers of light,
      Such stars as earth has never seen;
    And all through England’s girded vales,
      Her steep hill-sides and haunted streams,
    Where woodlands dip into the dales,
      Where’er the Hawthorn stands and dreams,
    Where thick-leaved trees make dark the day,
    I’ll light each nook with flowers of May.
    Like pearly dew-drops, white and round,
      The shut-up buds shall first appear.
    And in them be such fragrance found,
      As breeze before did never bear;
    Such as in Eden only dwelt,
      When angels hovered round its bowers,
    And long-haired Eve at morning knelt
      In innocence amid the flowers:
    While the whole air was, every way,
    Filled with a perfume sweet as May.
    And oft shall groups of children come,
      Threading their way through shady places,
    From many a peaceful English home,
      The sunshine falling on their faces;
    Starting with merry voice the thrush,
      As through green lanes they wander singing,
    To gather the sweet Hawthorn bush;
      Which, homeward in the evening bringing
    With smiling faces, they shall say,
    ‘There’s nothing half so sweet as May.’
    And many a poet yet unborn
      Shall link its name with some sweet lay,
    And lovers oft at early morn
      Shall gather blossoms of the May;
    With eyes bright as the silver dews,
      Which on the rounded May-buds sleep,
    And lips, whose parted smiles diffuse
      A sunshine o’er the watch they keep,
    Shall open all their white array
    Of pearls, ranged like the buds of May.”
    Spring shook the cloud on which she lay,
    And silvered o’er the Hawthorn spray,
    Then showered down the buds of May.

MYRTLE.... _Love_.


The Myrtle has ever been consecrated to Venus. At Rome, the temple of
the goddess was surrounded by a grove of Myrtles; and in Greece, she was
adorned under the name of Myrtilla. It was observed by the ancients,
that, wherever the Myrtle grew, it excluded all other plants. So love,
wherever it is permitted to grow, excludes all other feelings. The
ladies of modern Rome retain a strong affection for this plant,

ORCHIS.... _A Belle_.


The Butterfly Orchis is rather rare except where there is a chalky soil.
The Spider Orchis has gained its name from the great resemblance it
bears to one of those large, fat-bodied garden spiders, which are often
noticed for the singular beauty of the markings on their backs. Another
is so very like a fly, that it is named the Fly Orchis; another is like
a lizard, or some strange reptile, and the flowers being yellow, green,
and purple, and twisted in and about one another in a very odd way, it
really looks like some horrible group of queer living creatures. One,
from being fancied like a man, is called Man Orchis; another, very gayly
spotted, and ornamented with a helmet-like appendage, is the Military
Orchis; another is called Bee Orchis. Bishop Mant thus alludes to some
of these:

    Well boots it the thick-mantled leas
    To traverse: if boon nature grant,
    To crop the insect-seeming plant,
    The vegetable Bee; or nigh
    Of kin, the long-horned Butterfly,
    White, or his brother purple pale,
    Scenting alike the evening gale;
    The Satyr flower, the pride of Kent,
    Of Lizard form, and goat-like scent.

BOX.... _Stoicism_.


The common Box, of which our hedge is formed, is indigenous in England,
preferring the chalky hills of Surrey and Kent for its residence, but
flourishing well on other soils. It is one of the most useful evergreen
shrubs we possess, and especially as it will grow under the drip and
shadow of other trees, as you know is the case with our hedge. It is
found in most European countries, from Britain southwards, also about
Mount Caucasus, Persia, China, Cochin China, and America. It was
formerly much more common in England than now, having disappeared under
the spread of agriculture. Box-hill, in Surrey, is named from this tree,
and is a conical elevation covered with a wood of Box-trees, some of
large size. Boxley in Kent, and Boxwell in Gloucestershire, are also
named from it. The leaf and general appearance of the tree are too
familiar to require any description. The scent of the spring blossoms is
rather powerful, and to some persons unpleasant. The timber is very
valuable, it is sold by weight, and, being very hard and smooth, and not
apt to warp, is well adapted for many nice and delicate purposes. In the
days of good old Evelyn, it appears to have been as much used as at
present, for he says, “It is good for the turner, engraver, carver,
mathematical instrument maker, comb and pipe, or flute-maker, and the
roots for the inlayer and cabinet-maker. Of box are made wheels,
sheaves, pins, pegs for musical instruments, nut-crackers,
button-moulds, weavers’ shuttles, hollar-sticks, bump-sticks, and
dressers for the shoemaker, rulers, rolling-pins, pestles, mall-balls,
beetles, tops, chessmen, tables, screws, bobbins for bone-lace, spoons,
knife-handles, but especially combs.” Most of those engravings in books,
called wood-cuts, are done upon Box wood, and for that purpose English
Box is superior to any other, though a great portion of what is used in
this country comes from the Levant. The ancients used combs made of
Box-wood, and also instruments to be played on with the mouth. The
Romans used to adorn their gardens with it, clipped into form, as we
find from mention being made of clipped Box-trees by their writers. It
was formerly much cut in this manner here, and was ranked next to the
Yew for its capabilities of taking artificial and grotesque forms; but
except a few ancient hedges of Box, like our own, and those at Castle
Bromwich Hall, where the Yew hedges are also preserved, there are not
many vestiges of its former garden-glory remaining. A dwarf kind is used
for making a neat and firm edging to flower borders, for which nothing
answers so well, or produces so proper an effect.

NARCISSUS AND DAFFODIL.... _Self-Love_.


There are several species of the Narcissus. The Yellow Narcissus is
better known as the Daffodil, and bears much resemblance to the Yellow
Lily. The Poetic Narcissus is the largest of the species, and may be
distinguished by the crimson border of the very shallow and almost flat
cup of the nectary. Shakspeare, in his Winter’s Tale, speaks of

                                Daffodils,
    That come before the swallow dares, and taste
    The winds of March with beauty.

The ancients attributed the origin of the Narcissus to the metamorphosis
of a beautiful youth of that name, who, having slighted the love of the
nymph Echo, became enamoured of his own image, which he beheld in a
fountain, and pined to death in consequence.

    I wandered lonely, as a cloud
      That floats on high o’er vales and hills
    When all at once I saw a crowd,

    Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
    Continuous as the stars that shine
      And twinkle on the milky way,
    They stretched in never-ending line
      Along the margin of the bay;
    Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
    Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

    The waves beside them danced, but they
      Outdid the sparkling waves in glee;
    A poet could not but be gay
      In such a joyful company:
    I gazed--and gazed--but little thought
    What wealth to me the show had brought.
    For oft when on my couch I lie,
      In vacant or in pensive mood,
    They flash upon that inward eye
      Which is the bliss of solitude.
    And then my heart with pleasure fills,
    And dances with the Daffodils.

LILY.... _Majesty_.


The Lily’s height and beauty speak command. The Jews imitated its form
in the decorations of their first magnificent temple; and Christ
described it as more splendid than King Solomon in his most gorgeous
apparel. According to ancient mythology, there was originally but one
species of Lily, and that was orange-coloured; and the white was
produced by the following circumstance:--Jupiter, wishing to render
Hercules immortal, prevailed on Juno to take a deep draught of nectar,
which threw the queen into a profound sleep. Jupiter then placed the
infant Hercules at her breast, so that the divine milk might ensure
immortality. Hercules drew the milk faster than he could swallow it, and
some drops fell to the earth, from which immediately sprang the White
Lily.

    The angel whispered to the Rose,
    “O fondest object of my care,
    Still fairest found where all are fair,
    For the sweet shade thou hast given to me,
    Ask what thou wilt, ’tis granted thee.”
    Then said the Rose, with deepening glow,
    “On me another grace bestow.”
    The spirit paused in silent thought--
    What grace was there that flower had not?
    ’Twas but a moment--o’er the Rose
    A veil of moss the angel throws;
    And, robed in nature’s simplest weed,
    Could there a flower that Rose exceed?

WHITE WATER-LILY.... _Purity_.


The White Water-Lily is the Queen of the Waves, and reigns sole
sovereign over the streams; and it was a species of Water-Lily which the
old Egyptians and ancient Indians worshipped--the most beautiful object
that was held sacred in their superstitious creed, and one which we
cannot look upon even now without feeling a delight mingled with
reverence. No flower looks more lovely than this “Lady of the Lake,”
resting her crowned head on a green throne of velvet, and looking down
into the depths of her own sky-reflecting realms, watching the dance, as
her attendant water-nymphs keep time to the rocking of the ripples, and
the dreamy swaying of the trailing water streams.

MARIGOLD.... _Grief_.


The Marigold is the conventional emblem of distress of mind. It is
distinguished by many singular properties. It blossoms the whole year,
and on that account, the Romans termed it the flower of the calends, or
of all the months. Its flowers are open only from nine in the morning
till three in the afternoon. They always follow the course of the sun,
by turning from east to west as he proceeds upon his daily journey. In
July and August these flowers emit, during the night, small luminous
sparks. Alone, the Marigold expresses grief; interwoven with other
flowers, the varied events of life; the cloud and sunshine of ill and
good.

The White Rose became celebrated in English history as the badge of the

considered the Rose as the queen of flowers, it was the custom to crown
new-married persons with a chaplet of Red and White Roses; and in the
procession of the Corybantes, the goddess Cybele, the protectress of
cities, was pelted with White Roses.

YELLOW ROSE.... _Jealousy_.


Pfeffel, a German poet, has pleasingly accounted for the origin of the
Yellow Rose, the emblem of envy and jealousy, in the following manner:

    Once a White Rose-bud reared her head,
    And peevishly to Flora said,
    “Look at my sister’s blushing hue--
    Pray, mother, let me have it too.”
    “Nay, child,” was Flora’s mild reply,
    “Be thankful for such gifts as I
    Have deemed befitting to dispense--
    Thy dower the hue of innocence.”
    When did Persuasion’s voice impart
    Content and peace to female heart
    Where baleful Jealousy bears sway,
    And scares each gentler guest away?
    The Rose still grumbled and complained,
    Her mother’s bounties still disdained.
    “Well, then,” said angered Flora--“take”--
    She breathed upon her as she spake--
    “Henceforth no more in simple vest
    Of innocence shalt thou be drest--
    Take that which better suits thy mind,
    The hue for Jealousy designed!”
    The Yellow Rose has from that hour
    Borne evidence of Envy’s power.

                            Is whispering nothing?
    Is leaning cheek to cheek?--is meeting noses?
    Kissing with inside lip?--stopping the career
    Of laughter with a sigh?--(a note infallible
    Of breaking honesty:)--horsing foot to foot?--
    Skulking in corners?--wishing clocks more swift?--
    Hours, minutes?--noon, midnight? and all eyes
    Blind with the pin and web, but theirs,--theirs only,
    That would unseen be wicked?--is this nothing?
    Why, then the world, and all that’s in it, is nothing.

RED ROSE.... _Beauty and Love_.


According to ancient fable, the red colour of the Rose may be traced to
Venus, whose delicate foot, when she was hastening to the relief of her
beloved Adonis, was pierced by a thorn that drew blood,

    Which on the White Rose being shed,
    Made it for ever after red.

    _Herrick._

Miller, the “basket-maker” and poet, gives the following beautiful
account of the origin of the Red Rose:--

     It was drawing toward the decline of a beautiful summer day, when
     the red, round sun was bending down a deep, blue, unclouded sky, to
     where a vast range of mountains stretched, summit upon summit, and
     in the far distance again rose, pile upon pile, until high over all
     towered the god-haunted height of cloud-capt Olympus, rising with
     its rounded shoulder, like another world, on the uttermost rim of
     the horizon. At the foot of this immense world of untrodden
     mountains, opened out a wide, immeasurable forest, stretching far
     away, league upon league, with its unexplored ocean of trees, which
     were bounded somewhere by another range of unknown mountains, that
     again overlooked a vast, silent, and unpeopled world. On the edge
     of this pathless desert of trees, and nearest the foot of Olympus,
     sat the Queen of Beauty and of Love; with her golden tresses
     unbound, and her matchless countenance buried within the palms of
     her milk-white hands, and sobbing as if her fond, immortal heart
     would break. Beside her was laid the dead body of Adonis, his face
     half-hidden beneath the floating fall of her hair, as she bent over
     him and wept. Beyond them lay the stiffened bulk of the grim and
     grisly boar, his hideous jaws flecked with blood and foam, and his
     terrible tusks glittering like the heads of pointed spears, as they
     stood out, sharp and white, in the unclouded sunset. Not an
     immortal comforter was by: for the far-seeing eye of Jove was fixed
     listlessly upon the golden nectar-cup, as it passed from hand to
     hand, along the rounded circle of the gods, while they were
     recounting the deeds of other days, when they waged war against the
     Titans. Even the chariot of Venus stood unyoked at the foot of the
     mount; the silken traces lay loosely thrown together upon the
     ground, and the white doves were idly hovering round in the air;
     for the weeping goddess was so overwhelmed with sorrow, that she
     had forgotten to waft her light-winged whisper to the Mount of
     Olympus; nor had they received any summons from the charioteer
     Love, who lay sleeping upon a bed of Roses, with his bow and arrows
     by his side.

     In the glade of this vast forest of the old primeval world, whose
     echoes had never been startled by the blows of a descending axe,
     nor a branch rent from their majestic boles, saving by the dreaded
     bolts of the Thunderer, or some earth-shaking storm, which, in his
     anger, he had blown abroad, the Goddess of Beauty still continued
     to sit, as if unconscious of the savage solitude which surrounded
     her; nor did she notice the back-kneed Satyrs, that peered upon her
     unrobed loveliness with burning eyes, from many a shadowy recess in
     the thick-leaved underwood. Upon the trunks of the mighty and
     storm-tortured trees, the sunset here and there flashed down in
     rays of molten gold, making their gnarled and twisted stems look as
     if they had just issued red-hot from the jaws of some cavern-like
     furnace, whose glare the fancy might still trace in a blackened
     avenue of trees, up which the red ranks of the consuming lightning
     had ages agone marched. Every way, where the lengthened shadows of
     evening began to fall in deeper masses, the forest assumed a more
     savage look, which was heightened by the noise of some
     deadly-tusked boar, as he went snorting and thundering through the
     thicket; the growl of the tiger was also heard at intervals, as he
     retreated farther into the deepening darkness of the dingles,
     mistaking the blazing sunset for some devouring fire. But the eyes
     of Venus saw only the pale face of her lover,--she felt only his
     chilly and stiffened hand sink colder and deeper into the warm
     heart on which she pressed it, and over which her tears fell,
     slower or faster, just as the mournful gusts of her sorrow arose or
     subsided, and sent the blinding rain from the blue-veined lids that
     overhung her clouded eyes; for never had her immortal heart before
     been swollen by such an overflowing torrent of grief. But the
     warmth of her kisses, which would almost have awakened life in a
     statue of marble, fell upon lips now cold as a wintry grave; and
     her sighs, which came sweeter than the morning air when it first
     arises from its sleep among the Roses, stirred not one of the
     clotted ringlets which softened into the yielding whiteness of her
     heavenly bosom,--

    “She looked upon his lips, and they are pale;
      She took him by the hand, and that was cold;
    She whispered in his ear a heavy tale,
      As if they heard the woful words she told.”

     She would have given her immortality but to have heard those lips
     murmur and complain, as they had done a few hours before--to have
     seen those eyes again burning with disdain, as they flashed back
     indignantly the warm advances of her love. She pictured him as he
     had that very morning stood, in all the pride of youthful manliness
     and beauty, when he looked down, blushing and abashed, as he held
     his boar-spear in his hand, when she threw the studded bridle over
     her own rounded and naked arm, and the proud courser pricked up his
     ears with delight, and shook his braided mane, while his long tail
     streamed out like a banner, and his proud eye dilated, and his
     broad nostrils expanded, as he went trampling haughtily on, proud
     to be led by the Queen of Beauty and of Love. She pictured the
     Primrose bank on which he lay twined reluctantly in her arms, how
     he tried to conceal his face, this way, and that way, among the
     flowers, whenever she attempted to press his lips,--

    “While on each cheek appeared a pretty dimple:
      Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,
    He might be buried in a tomb so simple.”
     She recalled his attitude as he untwined himself from her embrace,
     and hurried off in pursuit of his steed, which had snapped the rein
     that secured it to the branch of a neighbouring oak, and started at
     full speed down one of the wild avenues of the forest. In fancy she
     again saw him, as he sat panting upon the ground, weary with the
     fruitless pursuit; and how, kneeling down, she then

                “Took him gently by the hand,
    A lily prisoned in a jail of snow,
      Or ivory in an alabaster band:
    So white a friend engirt so white a foe;
      A beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,
      Showed like two silver doves that sat a-billing.”

     And as she looked upon him, she imagined that his lips moved again,
     as when they said, “Give me my hand, why dost thou feel it?” she
     fancied she again felt his face upon her cheek--his kisses upon her
     lips, as when she fell down and feigned herself dead; the while he
     bent her fingers, and felt her pulse, and endeavoured by a hundred
     endearments and tender expressions, to restore her. And how, when
     she pretended to recover, she paid him back again with unnumbered
     kisses, whilst he, wearied with opposing her, no longer offered any
     resistance; and how, at last, he broke from her fair arms, and,
     darting down the “dark lawn,” left her seated alone upon the
     ground.

     As picture after picture rose before her of what had been, and
     every close pressure of the cold, inanimate, but still dearly-loved
     form, told her what the hand of death had done, and that those
     very “hopes and fears which are akin to love” were now for ever
     darkened and extinguished; she burst forth into such a loud,
     wailing lamentation, that the sound found its way unto Olympus, and
     fell upon the ever-open ear of Jove, who, in a moment, dashed the
     golden nectar-cup upon the ground, which he was about uplifting to
     his lips, and sprang upon his feet. There was a sound of hurrying
     to and fro over the mountain-summits, which sloped down to the edge
     of the forest--of gods and goddesses passing through the air--of
     golden chariots, that went whistling along like the wind, as they
     cleft their rapid way--and the flapping of dark, immortal wings,
     between which many a beautiful divinity was seated. The golden
     clouds of sunset gathered red and ominously about the rounded
     summit of Olympus, and a blood-red light glared upon such parts of
     the forest as were not darkened by the deepening shadows of the
     approaching twilight,--for the Thunderer had stamped his immortal
     foot, and jarred the mighty mountain to its very base. And now, in
     that forest glade, which but a few moments before was so wild and
     desolate,--where only the forms of the grisly boar, the dead
     Adonis, and the weeping Goddess of Beauty broke the level lines of
     the angry sunset, were assembled the stern Gods, and the weeping
     Graces, and the fluttering Loves that ever hover around the chariot
     of Venus. With bleeding feet and drooping head,--wan, and cold, and
     speechless,--was the Goddess of Beauty lifted into her golden
     chariot, and, with the dead body of Adonis, wafted by her silver
     and silent-winged doves to Mount Olympus. And then a deep darkness
     settled down upon the forest. When the next morning’s sun arose
     and gilded those silent glades, the Roses, on which the blood of
     the Goddess of Beauty had fallen, and which were ever before white,
     were changed into a delicate crimson; and wherever a tear had
     fallen, there had sprung up a flower which the earth had never
     before borne, and that was the Lily of the Valley; and wherever a
     ruddy drop had fallen from the death-wound of Adonis sprang up the
     red flower which still beareth his name. Even the white
     apple-blossoms, which he clutched in his agony, ever after wore the
     ruddy stain which they caught from his folded fingers; and the
     drowsy Poppy grew up everywhere around the spot, as if to denote
     that the only consolation which can be found for sorrow is the
     long, unbroken sleep of death. Thus the Rose, which was before
     white, became red, and was ever after dedicated to Beauty and Love.

Its beautiful tint is traced to another source by a modern poet:

    As erst in Eden’s blissful bowers,
    Young Eve surveyed her countless flowers,
    An opening Rose of purest white
    She marked with eye that beamed delight,
    Its leaves she kissed, and straight it drew
    From beauty’s lip the vermeil hue.

    _Carey._

The poets have not exaggerated the beauty of the red-hued Rose. She
would be crowned Queen of the Flowers by the most unpoetical. The
emblem of all ages, the interpreter of all our feelings, the Rose
mingles with our festivities, our joys, and our griefs. Its fragrance is
as delightful as its hues; and no truer emblem of love and beauty could
have been chosen.

                            I have cherished
    A love for one whose beauty would have charmed
    In Athens. And I know what ’tis to love
    A spiritual beauty, and behind the foil
    Of an unblemished loveliness, still find
    Charms of a higher order, and a power
    Deeper and more resistless. Had I found
    Such thoughts and feelings, such a clear deep stream
    Of mind in one whom vulgar men had thrown
    As a dull pebble from them, I had loved
    Not with a love less fond, nor with a flame
    Of less devotion.

vicinity of the Nettles, nor, therefore, to injure them, our boyish
fancy looked upon them as cruel.

COLUMBINE.... _Desertion_.

      But, ere the wreath be done--oh! let
        The Columbine be there.

PINK.... _Pure Love_.


The primitive Pink is simple red or white, and scented; but cultivation
has varied the colour from the darkest purple to the purest white. Under
all its diversities, however, it retains its delicious, spicy fragrance,
and hence has been made the emblem of woman’s love, which no
circumstance can change. Florists designate two principal divisions of
these flowers, Pinks and Carnation. The former are marked by a spot
resembling an eye, and by a more humble growth. The flower of the
Carnation is much larger than that of the Pink, and of a deeper hue. The
Carnation was called by some of the old English writers the clove-gilly
flower, from its perfume resembling that of cloves.

SENSITIVE PLANT.... _Chastity_.


This singular plant is so named from its motions imitating the
sensibility of animal life. It contracts itself in the evening and
expands with the morning light, and shrinks from external violence,
folding up its leaves at the mere approach of one’s hand. The Violet is
the emblem of that retiring modesty which proceeds from reflection, but
the Sensitive Plant is a perfect image of innocence and virgin modesty,

THYME.... _Activity_.


Among the ancient Greeks, Thyme denoted the graceful elegance of the
Attic style; because it covered Mount Hymettus, and gave an aromatic
flavour to the honey made there. Those writers who had mastered the
Attic style were said “to smell of Thyme.” Flies of all shapes, beetles
of all hues, bright butterflies, and vigilant bees for ever surround the
flower tufts of Thyme, and they thus seem to teem with life. Activity is
a warlike virtue, and is ever associated with true courage. On this
notion, the ladies of the days of chivalry embroidered on the scarfs
which they presented to their knights the figure of a bee hovering about
a sprig of Thyme.

HOLLYHOCK.... _Ambition_.


We have few flowers that contribute more to the ornamenting of large
gardens than the Hollyhock, which, from its towering height and seeming
love of display, is the emblem of ambition. The flowers are of all hues,
from a blackish-purple to a faint white, and, though very beautiful, are
without fragrance. They give gayety to the shrubbery until a late season
of the year, throwing out a succession of flowers till the arrival of
frost.

    For the high ones and powerful shall come
    To do you reverence; and the beautiful
    Will know the purer language of your soul,
    And read it like a talisman of love.

    The spirit, and forget yourself in thought.

LAUREL.... _Glory_.


Among the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Laurel was consecrated to every
species of glory. The beautiful shrub grows abundantly at Delphi, on the
banks of the river Peneus. There its aromatic and evergreen branches
shoot up to the height of the loftiest trees; and it is alleged that, by
means of some secret virtue, they avert lightning from the spots which
they adorn.

According to ancient fable, Daphne was the daughter of the river Peneus.
Apollo fell in love with her, but she, preferring virtue to the love of
the most eloquent of the gods, fled, in order to avoid the seducing
magic of his words. Apollo pursued, and was on the point of overtaking
her, when the nymph invoked her father, and was changed into a Laurel.
The god, finding that he clasped an insensible tree in his arms, kissed
its bright leaves. “Since thou canst not be my spouse,” said he, “thou
shalt, at least, be my tree.” Thence-forward the Laurel was sacred to
Apollo.

AMARANTH.... _Immortality_.


The Amaranth is unfading; and it has, therefore, been made the emblem of
immortality. In Homer’s time, it was customary to wear crowns of
Amaranth at the funerals of distinguished personages. Milton, in his
Lycidas, classes it among the flowers that “sad embroidery wear.” In the
floral games at Toulouse, the principal prize was a golden Amaranth for
the best lyric composition. The Amaranthus hypochondriacus, one of the
American species, is better known by the name of Prince’s Feather.

STRAWBERRY.... _Perfection_.


An eminent French author conceived the plan of writing a general history
of nature, after the model of the ancients. A Strawberry plant, which,
perchance, grew under his window, deterred him from this bold design. He
examined the Strawberry, and, in so doing, discovered so many wonders,
that he felt convinced the study of a single plant was sufficient to
occupy a whole lifetime. He therefore gave up the pompous title which he
had meditated for his work, and contented himself with calling it
“Studies of Nature.” The flowers of the Strawberry form pretty bouquets;
but, as the delicious fruit is preferred to the flower, they are seldom
plucked for that purpose. Among the glaciers of the Alps, the plants and
flowers of the Strawberry are found in all seasons of the year. The
plant seems to possess all the merits of plants, in their greatest
perfection. The berries are the favourite accompaniment of the lordly
feast and the most exquisite luxury of the rural repast. They vie in
freshness and perfume with the buds of the sweetest flowers; delighting
the eye, the taste, and smell, at the same time.

SUNFLOWER.... _False Riches_.


The Sunflower has been thus named from the resemblance which its broad
golden disk and rays bear to the sun. The first Spaniards who arrived in
Peru were amazed at the profuse display of gold among the people, but
they were still more astonished when, in May, they beheld whole fields
covered with these flowers, which they concluded, at first sight, must
be of the same precious metal. From this circumstance, and the
observation that gold, however abundant, cannot render a person truly
rich, the Sunflower has been made the emblem of false wealth. Many of
the English poets have adopted the notion that this flower ever turns
its face to the sun. Thomson, Moore, Darwin, and Barton make a very fine
use of the idea. But it is not a fact. Those flowers which face the east
at the opening of day, never turn to the west at the close of it.

HELIOTROPE.... _Devoted Affection_.


The Heliotrope is a native of Peru. It is often confounded with the
Sunflower, though it is of a different genus. The blossoms of the
Heliotrope form clusters of very small, delicate, fragrant flowers,
generally of a faint purple colour or white, sometimes red, or
bluish-white. It is a general favourite of the fair sex, and is
considered as the emblem of devoted affection, on account of its face
being ever turned to the sun, which it seems to worship. The Heliotrope
was introduced into Europe in 1740, by the celebrated Jussieu.

JASMINE.... _Amiability_.


The Jasmine is a happy emblem of an amiable disposition. In all
situations, it suffers the gardener to train its slender branches into
any form he chooses: most commonly forming a living tapestry for arbours
and garden walls, and everywhere throwing out a profusion of delicate
and charming flowers, which perfume the air. The poets have showered
their praise upon this plant, and all unite in considering it the emblem
of the winsome quality of amiability. After paying a glowing tribute to
the beauty and sweetness of the Violet, Thomas Miller, the
“basket-maker” poet, thus speaks of the Jasmine:--

Stepping further into summer, comes the star-white Jasmine,--that sweet
perfumer of the night, which only throws out its full fragrance when its
sister stars are keeping watch in the sky; as if, when the song of the
nightingale no longer cheered the darkness, it sent forth its silent
aroma upon the listening air. Many a happy home does it garland, and
peeps in at many a forbidden lattice, where Love and Beauty repose.
Little did the proud courtiers and stately dames of Queen Elizabeth’s
day dream that this sweet-scented creeper (a sprig of which seemed to
make the haughty haughtier still) would one day become so common as to
cluster around and embower thousands of humble English cottages,--a
degradation which, could they but have witnessed, would almost have made
every plait of their starched ruffs bristle up, like “quills upon the
fretful porcupine.” Beautiful are its long, drooping, dark-green shoots,
trailing around the trellis-work of a door-way, like a green curtain
embroidered with silver flowers; while here and there the queenly
Moss-Rose, creeping in and out like the threads of a fanciful tapestry,
its crimson face amid the embowered green,--a beautiful lady peeping
through a leaf-clad casement.

COWSLIP.... _Pensiveness_.


The solitary Cowslip was known to the old English poets as the “sweet
nun of the fields,” and has been immortalized in “Shakspeare’s Midsummer
Night’s Dream.” In America, the Cowslip may be found from Maine to
Missouri. Its hues are not gaudy, but winning; and the whole appearance
of the flower, as it blooms in some solitary vale, or on some gentle
slope, expresses the idea of pensive beauty.

FORGET-ME-NOT.


The name of this flower expresses clearly enough the meaning which is
given to it. As a remembrancer it is universally received and eulogized.
The name is derived from a German tradition, full of melancholy romance.
It is related that a young couple, on the eve of being united, while
walking along the banks of the Danube, saw a cluster of these flowers,
floating on the stream, which was bearing it away. The affianced bride
admired the beauty of the flower, and lamented its fatal destiny. The
lover plunged into the water to secure it. No sooner had he caught it
than he found himself sinking; but, making a last effort, he threw it on
the bank at the feet of his betrothed, and, at the moment of
disappearing for ever, exclaimed, “_Vergiss mein nicht!_” Since that
event, this flower has been made emblematical of the sentiment,
Forget-me-not. Its corollas are of a soft cerulean-blue colour, and it
presents an interesting appearance as it grows along the banks of the
rivers. The Forget-me-not is found in great perfection on the banks of a
small stream near Luxembourg, in France. The stream is called the
Fairies’ Bath, and its banks are the favourite resort of festive
parties.

      Said then the lady fair,

ROSEMARY.... _Remembrance_.


The Rosemary is so often mentioned by our early writers, both in prose,
poetry, and our oldest dramas, that a long article, possessing great
interest to such as love old-fashioned things, might be written upon it.
The Rosemary was used both at their feasts and their funerals,--the
christening-cup was stirred with it, and it was worn at their marriage
ceremonies. Shakspeare has chosen it for the emblem of Remembrance, and
who would attempt to change the meaning of a flower which his genius has
hallowed, or disturb a leaf over which he has breathed his holy
“superstition?”--in memory of him we use the latter word in all
reverence. A few years ago it was customary, in many parts of England,
to plant slips of Rosemary over the dead; nor has the practice yet
fallen altogether into disuse--rural cemeteries will revive these
ancient customs. Shakspeare chose the Rosemary as the emblem of
affectionate remembrance, for its flowering in winter,--a very poetic
and touching allusion. The sweet maniac, Ophelia, says,

    There’s Rosemary, “That for remembrance,
    I pray you love, remember.”

    I loved thee, and must love thee still,
      In memory of the past
    Amid whate’er of earthly ill
      My future lot is cast!
    E’er in my boyhood’s sunny prime,
    When brightly from the urn of Time
      Life’s golden moments fell,
    Thou wert a peri to my eyes,
    Sent from Love’s own sweet paradise,
      In my young heart to dwell.

    My thoughtful mind runs o’er the track of years,

ANEMONE.... _Forsaken_.


Anemone was a nymph, beloved by Zephyr. Flora, jealous of her, banished
her from her court and transformed her into a flower, that blows before
the return of spring. Zephyr has abandoned this unhappy beauty to the
rude caresses of Boreas, who, unable to gain her love, harshly shakes
her, half opens her blossoms, and causes her immediately to fade. An
Anemone, with these words, _Brevis est usus_--“Her reign is short”--is
touchingly expressive of the transitory nature of beauty.

In spring the green woods of merry England are covered with the flowers
of the Anemone. Turn the eye whichever way you will, there it greets you
like “a pleasant thought;” it forms a bed of flowers around the foot of
the mighty oak, and below the tangling brambles, which you may peep
between, but cannot pass,--there, also, are its pearly blossoms bending.
The Greeks named it the flower of the Wind, and so plentiful is it in
our country that we might fancy the breeze had blown it everywhere. The
gaudy Anemone of the garden, the emblem of forsaken love, is known to
all; but our favourites are the uncultivated offspring of the windy
woods, which come long before the broad green leaves hang overhead to
shelter them.

ACACIA.... _Friendship_.


The Acacia is a native of North America, from Canada to the Carolinas,
and was consecrated by the Indians to the goddess of chaste love. Their
bows were made of the incorruptible wood of this tree, and their arrows
were pointed with its thorns. About a century ago, this tree was
introduced into France by Robin, the botanist. It is a large, handsome
tree, of quick growth, elegant foliage, and beautiful, rose-coloured
blossoms.

MOSS.... _Maternal Love_.


Moss is selected to be the emblem of maternal love, because, like that
love, it glads the heart when the winter of adversity overtakes us, and
when summer friends have deserted us. Rousseau, so long the prey of his
own passions, and tormented by those of other men, soothed the latter
years of his life by the study of nature. The Mosses, in particular,
attracted his attention. It is these, he would say, that give a look of
youth and freshness to the fields, at the moment when the flowers have
gone to their graves. In winter the Mosses offer to the eye of the lover
of nature their carpet of emerald green, their secret nuptials, and the
charming mysteries of the urns and amphoræ which enclose their
posterity. It is asserted that without the Mosses, part of our globe
would be uninhabitable. At the northern extremity of the earth, the
Laplanders cover their subterranean abodes with Moss, and thus defy the
longest and most terrible winters. Their numerous herds of reindeer have
no other food, yet they supply their owners with delicious milk,
nutritious flesh, and warm clothing; thus combining for the poor
Laplander all the advantages that we derive from the horse, cow, and
sheep.

    The docile, swift Reindeer! Oh, when I was a child,
    I loved all strange fantastic tales, the wondrous and the wild;
    I read about the “Hundred Nights,” in the Arabian Tales,
    That tell of Genii, sprites, and dwarfs, of gold and diamond vales.
    I read of Eastern gardens and palaces so rare,
    And of Sultans and Sultanas, the cruel and the fair.
    I read of Robin Crusoe! Ah! how I loved that book!
    Nor even yet hath its strong charm wholly my mind forsook.
    I read of voyages without end; of travels many too,
    And fairy-tales and story-books--of these, good sooth, not few.
    But I remember, more than all, I loved to think and hear
    Of thee--thou strong and beautiful--thou swift and good Reindeer!
    I remember in my earliest home, a dim antique beaufet,
    And high upon its many shelves, things manifold were set.
    Some piles of dark old books there were, amid the motley crowd,
    And when tall enough to reach them, oh! glad was I, and proud.
    And there I found old Æsop, whose fables we all know,
    And Cookery-books of ancient dates, most grim and well worn too.
    These I just peeped at, and put back--and still went groping on
    Deep into that small mine of wealth that I so late had won.
    Soon with some daring tugs, I brought a lumbering volume slap
    Down on the floor! I sat down too, and dragged it on my lap.
    The binding was antique and worn--the title-page was out,
    And yet the treasure won from me a child’s exultant shout;
    For there were pictures many, of beast, and fish, and bird;
    And _thou_ wert there, thou good Reindeer, of whom so much I’d heard.
    And that great heavy ancient book was such a prize to me!
    It told me of the monstrous whale, and the small good honey-bee;
    It told me of the elephant, the tiger, the gazelle,
    Of the vast luxuriant jungles, and the lone, bright desert well;
    Of humming-birds that sip the dew of flowers as they fly,
    Of prairies wild, and wide, and green; of snowy mountains high:
    I read there of the Northern sea, where iceberg islands float,
    And crush the great three-masted ship, as ’twere a cockle-boat;
    I read about the harmless seals, and the shaggy Polar bear,
    And the mighty troops of hungry wolves that roam and riot there.
    I read of Nature’s glorious works, and wondering went on,
    And found before me pleasures, whose round will ne’er be done.
    And in my good old-fashioned book I read of herb and tree,
    That were food for man, and beast and bird, and for the honey-bee.
    I read of grove-like banyans, of cedars broad and tall,
    Of the lofty towering palm, and the Moss and lichen small.
    And then I found how wondrously the poor Reindeer was fed,
    When over all his frozen land deep winter’s snow lay spread;
    How GOD had bid the barren ground produce this strange small thing,
    On which whole countless herds of deer are ever pasturing:
    How, in the woods of scattered pine abundantly it grows,
    And clothes the earth for many a mile beneath the trackless snows;
    How the sagacious Reindeer delves, and scents his onward way,
    Till he reaches his scant mossy food, that doth his toil repay.
    Oh! see him with his master’s sledge! How swift they glide along,
    Like a bird, or a fairy car I’ve read of, in some quaint old song.
    Away! o’er the boundless snowy waste, so glittering and bright:
    Away!--through the dark pine forest, as gloomy as the night:
    Away o’er the frozen lake, the river, and the fen,
    Away! Away!--Ye have winsome steeds, ye little Lapland men!
    Ay, winsome steeds in sooth, with their antlers branched and high;
    So sure of foot, and swift of pace, they truly seem to fly.
    Ye need no palace-stables, no saucy pampered grooms,
    To stretch your cracking purse-strings, and strut in liveried plumes;
    No heavy half-year’s bills, for oats, beans, straw, and hay.
    The forest yields them lodgment, and food, where’er they stray.
    And thus we find, in every clime, things beautiful and fair,
    Each fitted to fulfil its task of use and beauty there;
    And I remember thinking so, when, a little child, I read

Bishop Mant thus describes the place where Mosses grow:--

    On upland hill, in lowland vale,

    Mantling the Alpine mountain hoar,
    On granite-rock, or boggy moor,
    On peat-clad marsh, or sandy heath,
    On hillock’s grassy slope; beneath
    The hedge-road fence, and on the bank,
    Fringed with the plumed osier dank,
    Of streamlet, pool, or waterfall;
    On wave-washed stone, on plastered wall;
    On tree of forest, or of fruit,
    The bark-clad trunk, the heaving root;
    Or where the spring with oozing slime
    Slides trickling down the rifted lime;
    Or where the grav’ly pathway leads
    Through shady woods, o’er plashy meads:--
    Exulting in the wintry cold,
    Their cups the mossy tribes unfold;
    Fringed, and beneath a coping hid
    Of filmy veil, and convex lid,
    On many a thread-like stalk, bespread
    With yellow, brown, or crimson red,
    In contrast to the leaves of green,
    A velvet carpet, where the queen
    Of fairies might in triumph lie
    And view the elvish revelry;

    That bursting forth, the seeds may seem

DANDELION.... _The Rustic Oracle_.


The Dandelion is the most common of flowers. It is found in the four
quarters of the globe, near the pole as beneath the equator, on the
margin of rivers and streams as well as on sterile rocks. It serves the
shepherd instead of a clock, while its feathery tufts are his barometer,
predicting calm or storm. The globes formed by the seeds of the
Dandelion are used for other purposes. If you are separated from the
object of your love, pluck one of those feathery spheres, charge each of
the little feathers with a tender thought; turn toward the spot where
the loved one dwells; blow, and the aërial travellers will faithfully
convey your secret message to his or her feet. If you wish to know if
that dear one is thinking of you, blow again; and if a single aigrette
is left upon the stalk, it is a proof that you are not forgotten.

                    As thinks
    The mariner of home,
    When doomed through many a dreary waste
    Of waters yet to roam,--

    My guiding star o’er life’s wild sea.

PIMPERNEL.... _The Weather-glass_.


THE COUNTRY MAID AND THE PIMPERNEL FLOWER.

    “I’ll go and peep at the Pimpernel,
    And see if she think the clouds look well;
        For if the sun shine,
        And ’tis like to be fine,
        I shall go to the fair,
        For my sweetheart is there:
    So, Pimpernel, what bode the clouds and the sky?
    If fair weather, no maiden so merry as I.”

    Now the Pimpernel flower had folded up
    Her little gold star in her coral cup,
        And unto the maid
        Thus her warning said:
        “Though the sun smile down,
        There’s a gathering frown
    O’er the checkered blue of the clouded sky;
    So tarry at home, for a storm is nigh.”

    The maid first looked sad and then looked cross,
    Gave her foot a fling, and her head a toss;
        “Say you so, indeed,
        You mean little weed?
        You’re shut up for spite,
        For the blue sky is bright,
    To more credulous people your warnings tell,
    I’ll away to the fair;--good day, Pimpernel.”

    “Stay at home! quoth the flower?--In sooth, not I;
    I’ll don my straw hat with a silken tie;
        O’er my neck so fair
        I’ll a kerchief wear,
        White, chequered with pink,
        And then--let me think,
    I’ll consider my gown, for I’d fain look well:”
    So saying, she stepped o’er the Pimpernel.

    Now the wise little flower, wrapped safe from harm,
    Sat fearlessly waiting the coming storm;
        Just peeping between
        Her snug cloak of green,
        Lay folded up tight,
        Her robe so bright;
    Though ’broidered with purple, and starred with gold,
    No eye might its bravery then behold.

    The fair maiden straight donned her best array,
    And forth to the festival hied away;
        But scarce had she gone
        Ere the storm came on;
        And, ’mid thunder and rain,
        She cried oft and again,
    “Oh! would I had minded yon boding flower,
    And were safe at home from the pelting shower.”

    Now, maidens, the tale that I tell would say,
    Don’t don fine clothes on a doubtful day,
    Nor ask advice, when, like many more,
    You had “made up your minds” some time before.

POPPY.... _Consolation_.


The Red Poppy is the floral symbol of consolation. The White Poppy is
supposed to express, “My bane, my antidote.” The juice extracted from
these plants is employed to soothe the restless invalid to sleep, and to
ease the pangs of disease. According to the mythology of the Grecians,
the Poppy owed its origin to Ceres, who created it to assuage her grief,
during her search after her daughter Proserpine, who was carried off by
Pluto. The Poppy is extensively cultivated in Europe, for the purpose of
making opium from it. Many species are cultivated in the garden. The
double flowers possess surpassing beauty, whether we consider their
delicate texture, elegance of shape, or variety of colouring. In the
time of Gesner, the celebrated botanist of Switzerland, the village
Damons and Chloes proved the sincerity of their lovers by placing in the
hollow of the palm of the left-hand, a petal, or flower-leaf of the
Poppy, which, on being struck by the other hand, was broken with a sharp
sound, which denoted true attachment; but faithlessness, when it failed
to snap.

PRIDE AND THE POPPIES.--THEIR GRANDEUR AND FALL.

    “We little Red-caps are among the corn,
    Merrily dancing at early morn,
    We know that the farmer hates to see
    Our saucy red faces; but here are we!

    “We pay no price for our summer coats,
    Like those slavish creatures, barley and oats;
    We don’t choose to be ground and eat,
    Like our heavy-head neighbour, Gaffer Wheat.

    “Who dare thrash _us_, we should like to know!
    Grind us, and bag us, and use us so!
    Let meaner and shabbier things than we
    So stupidly bend to utility!”

    So said little Red-cap, and all the rout
    Of the Poppy-clan set up a mighty shout;
    Mighty for them, but if _you_ had heard
    You had thought it the cry of a tiny bird.

    So the Poppy-folk flaunted it over the field,
    In pride of grandeur they nodded and reeled;
    And shook out their jackets, till naught was seen,
    But a wide, wide shimmer of scarlet and green.

    The Blue-bottle sat on her downy stalk,
    Quietly smiling at all their talk.
    The Marigold still spread her rays to the sun,
    And the purple Vetch climbed up to peep at the fun.

    The whimsical Bugloss, vain, beautiful thing,
    Whose flowers, like the orient butterfly’s wing,
    Are deep, glowing azure, was eager to shed
    O’er her yet unoped buds a delicate red;

    First crimson, then purple, then loveliest blue;
    E’en thrice doth she change her chameleon hue;
    And she pities the flowers that grow merrily by,
    Because in one dress they must bud, bloom, and die.

    The homely Corn-cockle cared nothing, not she,
    For the arrogance, bluster, and poor vanity
    Of the proud Poppy-tribe, but she flourished and grew,
    Content with herself, and her plain purple hue.

    The sun went down, and rose bright on the morrow,
    To some bringing joy, and to others e’en sorrow,
    But blithe was the rich rosy farmer that morn
    When he went with his reapers among the corn.

    Forth went they betimes, a right merry band,
    The sickles were glancing in each strong hand,
    And the wealthy farmer came trotting along,
    On his stiff little pony, mid whistle and song.

    He trotted along, and he cracked his joke,
    And chatted and laughed with the harvest-folk;
    For the weather was settled, barometers high,
    And heavy crops gladdened his practised eye.

    “We’ll cut this barley to-day,” quoth he,
    As he tied his white pony under a tree,
    “Next to the upland wheat, and then the oats.”
    How the Poppies shook in their scarlet coats!

    Ay, shook with laughter, not fear, for they
    Never dreamed they too should be swept away,
    And their laughter was spite, to think that all
    Their “useful” neighbours were doomed to fall.

    They swelled and bustled with such an air,
    The corn-fields quite in commotion were,
    And the farmer cried, glancing across the grain,
    “How those rascally weeds have come up again!”

    “Ha! ha!” laughed the Red-caps, “ha! ha! what a fuss
    Must the poor _weeds_ be in! how they’re envying _us_!”
    But their mirth was cut short by the sturdy strokes
    They speedily met from the harvest-folks.

    And when low on the earth each stem was laid,
    And the round moon looked on the havoc made,
    A Blue-bottle propped herself half erect,
    And made a short-speech--to this effect.

    “My dying kins-flowers, and fainting friends,
    The same dire fate alike attends
    Those who in scarlet or blue are dressed;
    Then how silly the pride that so late possessed

    “Our friends the Red-caps! how low they lie,
    Who were lately so pert, and vain, and high!
    They sneered at us and our plain array;
    Are we now a whit more humbled than they?

    “They scorned our neighbours:--the goodly corn
    Was the butt of their merriment eve and morn,
    They lived on its land, from its bounty fed,
    But a word of thanks they never have said.

    “And which is the worthiest now, I pray?
    Have ye not learned enough to-day?
    Is not the corn sheafed up with care,
    And are not the Poppies left dying there?

    “The corn will be carried and garnered up
    To gladden man’s heart both with loaf and cup;
    And some of the seed the land now yields
    Will be brought again to its native fields,

    “And grow and ripen and wave next year
    As richly as this hath ripened here;
    And we poor weeds, though needed not,
    Perchance may spring on this very spot.

    “But let us be thankful and humble too;

    That _usefulness_ is of all gifts the best.”

ACANTHUS.... _The Arts_.


The Acanthus blooms in greatest perfection by the great rivers of hot
climates. Among the ancients, it was a favourite, and they adorned their
furniture, vases, and costly dresses, with its elegant leaves. When any
obstacle obstructs the growth of the Acanthus, it puts forth fresh force
and grows with additional vigour. Thus genius is strengthened by the
difficulties which it cannot overcome. Callimachus, an ancient
architect, derived the idea of the Corinthian capital, from seeing the
leaves of an Acanthus surrounding a basket which had been set upon the
ground, and impeded the regular growth of the plant.

STOCK.... _Lasting Beauty_.


The Stock has been made the emblem of lasting beauty; because, though it
is less graceful than the rose, and less majestic than the lily, its
splendour is more durable, and its fragrance of longer continuance. Few
flowering plants have been so much and so rapidly improved by
cultivation as the Stock. Within the last two centuries, its nature has
been almost entirely changed by the florist; and it is now a shrub whose
branches are covered with blossoms little inferior in dimensions to the
rose. Stocks are produced of various colours, but the bright red or
carmine must ever remain the favourite variety. The principal branches
of this fragrant family are the Ten-week Stock, so named from flowering
about ten weeks after it is sown; and the Brompton, which does not bloom
till about twelve months after sowing, and was first cultivated in the
neighbourhood of Brompton, England.

SCARLET GERANIUM.... _Stupidity_.


There are many varieties of the Geranium, distinguished by the shape and

The Scarlet Geranium is a very beautiful flower, but its scent is

chosen as the emblem of stupidity. Madame de Staël was always angry when
any of her acquaintance attempted to introduce a stupid person into her
company. One day, one of her friends ventured to bring to her a young
Swiss officer of most prepossessing exterior. The lady, pleased with his
appearance, was very lively, and said a thousand flattering things to
the new-comer, who seemed at first to be struck mute by surprise and
admiration. When, however, he had listened to her for above an hour
without opening his lips, she began to suspect the cause of his silence,
and put to him such direct questions that he could not help answering.
His answers were extremely silly! Madame de Staël, vexed at having
thrown away her time and her wit, turned to her friend and said:
“Indeed, sir, you are like my gardener, who thought to do me a pleasure
by bringing me this morning a pot of Geranium: but I can tell you that I
made him take back the flower, desiring him not to let me see it any
more.” “And why so?” asked the young man in astonishment. “It was, since
you wish to know, because the Geranium is a beautiful scarlet flower;
while you look at it, it pleases the eye; but when you press it ever so
slightly, it gives out a disagreeable smell.” So saying, Madame de Staël
rose and went out of the room, leaving the young fool abashed and in
confusion.

TUBEROSE.... _Dangerous Love_.


The superb Tuberose is a native of the East Indies and South America,
and was introduced into Europe in 1632. It has since spread all over the
world. The flower is of a white colour, sometimes tinged with a blush of
pink. Its perfume is delicious and powerful; but if you would enjoy it
without danger, keep at some distance from the plant. If you come with
the object of your affection to inhale its perfume by moonlight, when
the nightingale is pouring forth its ravishing melody, these odours will
add an inexpressible charm to your enjoyment; but, if, regardless of the
precepts of moderation, you approach too near, this divine flower will
then be but an enchantress who will pour a dangerous poison into your
bosom. Thus the love which comes from above purifies and exalts; but
that which springs from earth debases and proves the bane of imprudent
youth.

THORN-APPLE.... _Deceitful Charms_.


The flowers of the Thorn-Apple droop while the sun shines beneath their
dull-looking foliage, but on the approach of night, they revive, display
their charms, and unfold their prodigious bells, which nature has
coloured with purple, lined with ivory; and to which she has given an
odour that attracts and intoxicates, but is so dangerous as to stupify
those who inhale it even in the open air. It is a dangerous plant to be
allowed to grow where children go, as the beauty of its flowers and
fruit is liable to tempt them to their destruction; since it possesses
so poisonous a quality as to produce paralysis, and even madness, in
those who have eaten it. Its leaves have been recommended for coughs and
asthma. The charms of the Thorn-Apple flower are beautiful, but deadly;

    Thy image steals between my God and me;
    Thy voice I seem in every hymn to hear,
    With every bead I drop too soft a tear.
    When from the censer clouds of fragrance roll,
    And swelling organs lift the rising soul,
    One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight,
    Priests, tapers, temples, swim before my sight:
    In seas of flame my plunging soul is drowned,
    While altars blaze, and angels tremble round.

LARKSPUR.... _Flights of Fancy_.


Larkspur, Lark’s-claw, Lark-heels, and Lark’s-toe have been given in
allusion to the long spur-like nectary, which has been whimsically
supposed to represent these things, and many more. The Latin name,
_Delphinium_, is from the Greek, Dolphin, because the nectary was
thought like that fish. The French call it _Dauphinelle_, _pied
d’alouette_, _l’épéron de chevalier_, (knight’s spur;) and the Italian,
_speronella_, (little spur,) _sperone di cavaliere_, (knight’s spur,)
and _fior regio_, (king-flower.) These names give quite a chivalric
importance to the gentle flower, and furnish abundant subject for
thought and fancy. Our own rural names give us a picture of the
sky-lark; that “musical cherub,” soaring far and high into the blue
summer heaven, above the lonely mountain-top, or over the busy town, and
we can recall the delight of listening to his sweet melody.

DYER’S WEED.... _Relief_.


Dyer’s Weed is like a very large upright plant of Mignonette, to which
sweet exotic it is nearly related, both being members of the _reseda_
family. The _Reseda odorata_, or Mignonette, is a native of Egypt, and
was introduced into England in 1752. The word _reseda_ is from _resedo_,
to calm, to appease. The plants were thought useful applications to
external bruises, to ease pain. There are two species growing wild in
England. _Reseda lutea_, or Base-rocket, likes a chalky soil, but _R.
luteola_, the Dyer’s Weed, is often found on waste ground everywhere. It
is much used by dyers, particularly in France. It affords a most
beautiful yellow dye, for cotton, woollen, mohair, silk, and linen. Blue
cloths dipped in a decoction of it become green. The entire plant, when
about to flower, is pulled up, and employed both fresh and dried. Like
the Coltsfoot, this plant is among the first which spring from the
rubbish thrown out of coal-pits. Linnæus observed, that the nodding
spike of flowers always follows the sun, even on a cloudy day, pointing
eastward in a morning, southward at noon, westward in the afternoon, and
northward at night. If this be true, it may supplant the sunflower in
the favour of sentimental florists, for the inconstancy of that has long
been proved. Good old Gerarde, who evidently did his best to believe all
things, says, that he has seen four sunflowers on one stem, pointing to
the four cardinal points. I am wandering from my subject, but must
remind you of some sweet lines by that poet of nature--Clare, where he
groups the sunflower so nicely; and you may look at that cottage, where
the children are playing, and see the picture nearly realized:

    Where rustic taste at leisure trimly weaves
    The rose and straggling woodbine to the eaves,
    And on the crowded spot that pales enclose
    The white and scarlet daisy rears in rows,
    Training the trailing peas in clusters neat,
    Perfuming evening with a luscious sweet,
    And sun-flowers planting for their gilded show,
    That scale the window’s lattice ere they blow,
    And, sweet to habitants within the sheds,
    Peep through the crystal panes their golden heads.

THE SWEET FLAG--ACORUS CALAMUS.... _Grace_.


    One autumn eve I sat alone
      Beside my study fire;
    I’d written long, and eyes and head
      And fingers ’gan to tire.

    I rose to shut my desk, and go--
      Quite weary--half asleep--
    A book fell open as I moved;
      E’en sleepy eyes must peep;

    And, pictured on its page, I saw
      The portrait of a friend,
    Whose smiling face bade my dull thoughts
      To happy memories wend.

    It was the tall, sweet-scented Flag,
      Lay pictured there so true,
    I could have deemed some fairy hand
      The faithful image drew.

    The falchion-leaves, all long and sharp;
      The stem, like a tall leaf too,
    Except where, halfway up its side,
      A cone-shaped flower-spike grew,

    Like a lady’s finger, taper, long,
      From end to end arrayed
    In close scale-armour, that was all
      Of starry flowers made.

    If you could fancy fairy folk
      Would mimic works of ours,
    You’d think their dainty fingers here
      Had wrought mosaic flowers.

    The tiny petals, neatly formed,
      With geometric skill,
    Are each one so exactly shaped,
      Its proper place to fill.

    And stamens, like fine golden dust,
      Spangle the flowerets green;
    Aught more compact and beautiful,
      Mine eyes have never seen!

    How well I know when first I met
      The Sweet Flag’s graceful form;
    ’Twas on a glowing summer’s day,
      Mid hearts as bright and warm.

    Mid hearts as warm as sunny gleams,
      And eyes as kind and bright,
    And spirits that, like sunshine too,
      Are cheering, loved, and light.

    We gathered there the Acorus
      From Claremont’s quiet lake;
    And home with me, full many a mile,
      I did the pale flower take.

    ’Twas new to me, but yet is not
      So very scarce and rare,
    As many a river knoweth well;
      None better than the Yare!

    For by its banks abundantly
      The fragrant tall leaves grow;
    Singing with reedy rustling voice,
      Whene’er soft breezes blow.

    The Mayor of Norwich holds in June
      His annual feast and show;
    And to the grand cathedral church
      Processions with him go.

    And then the gray and solemn aisles,
      And all the ancient floor,
    Are with the aromatic leaves
      Bestrewèd thickly o’er.

    In by-gone days the costly fumes
      Of incense here were shed;
    But sweeter far the fragrant gush
      That greets each passing tread.

    In the sordid streets are bowers built,
      Of these same reeds as well,
    Plaited and wrought like basket-work,
      All full of spicy smell.

    And many a queer and quaint device
      Are round about them made,
    Of the gold and red ranunculus,
      In varied shape and shade.

    Oh! many a young and guileless heart
      Is blithe as blithe can be,
    To walk through Norwich streets that morn,
      The decked out bowers to see.

    In far gone times, ere folks had grown
      So mighty nice and clever--
    When carpets were unheard-of things,
      And druggets dreamed of never--

    When wide bare floors of good hard mud
      Or stone, not over even,
    Were all that unto knightly strides,
      Or dames’ light steps, were given--

    When common rushes strewed the halls
      Where royal banquets were--
    How precious must these reeds have been
      Beside the banks of Yare!

    I can fancy high and dainty dames
      Sending stout serving-men
    To gather store of these sweet Flags,
      From river, pool, and fen.

    Perhaps to strew a lady’s bower,
      Perhaps the castle hall,
    Where warlike lords and knights should meet
      At stately festival.

    How often in the chapel too,
      The fresh-thrown reeds might lie;
    While the tears and smiles of a bridal band
      Went softly passing by!

    And they were there when sorrow deep
      Wept the untimely doom
    Of young, and bright, and beautiful,
      Borne to the ancestral tomb.

    In sooth it is an ancient thing,
      This new-found friend of mine,
    And many a scene of joy and wo
      Hath it known in days lang syne.

    I love it for them all right well,
      But yet I love it more
    For the fairy scene that lay around
      Its home on that lakeless shore:

    Beside the bank the stately trees
      Waved gently to and fro,
    And flitting specks of sunlight fell
      The leafy branches thro’,

    And danced among the tall keen reeds,
      And on the water fell,
    Where the merry fish were glancing swift;
      And the water snake, as well,

    Came, gliding in a graceful curl
      All silently and still,
    Like a lord in his own dominions there,
      Swimming about at will.

    Now toward the margin where we stood
      We saw him steering on,--
    Then under groups of lily leaves
      The happy thing was gone.

    And wild-fowl, water-rats, and all,
      Lived in that little lake;
    Oh, what a pleasant picture now
      My thoughts of it awake!

    Its margent of smooth lawny turf
      Was mossy, soft, and deep,
    Where the shadows broad of the beech and oak
      Seemed quietly to sleep.

    The rhododendrons, purple yet
      With many a massive wreath,
    Had seedling plants, a countless host,
      Crowding the turf beneath.

    I dearly love small relics brought
      From spots where I have been,
    That seem to certify the facts
      Of memory’s pictured scene;

    But seeds and roots of flowers are
      The pleasantest of all;--
    I’ve Broom-seeds from a heathy glen,
      And ferns from an old stone wall.

    Of wall-flower slips and roots I’ve got
      So many, that I’m fain,
    Dear as they are to me, to turn
      Many adrift again.

    My ivy-plant from Tintern’s braved
      Four winters’ stormy weather;
    I’ve scraps, too, from proud Kenilworth,
      And here they grow together.

    The feathery seeds of clematis
      In Goodrich I have caught;
    Hartstongue from Ragland’s lofty keep,
      With maiden-hair, I brought.

    And so at Claremont, where the crowd
      Of rhododendrons grew,
    My whims were humoured, and I now
      Am rearing one or two.

    And e’en those little things can bring
      Before me, passing well,
    The very nook where the scented leaves
      Of the graceful calamus dwell.

Beautiful art thou, O Broom! waving in all thy rich array of green and
gold, on the breezy bosom of the bee-haunted heath. The sleeping
sunshine, and the silver-footed showers, the clouds that for ever play
about the face of Heaven, the homeless winds, and the crystal-globed
dews, that settle upon thy blossoms like sleep on the veined eyelids of
an infant, are ever beating above and around thee, as if to tell that
they rejoice in thy companionship, and that, although a thousand years
have strided by with silent steps, time hath not abated an atom of their
love. Who can tell the thoughts of Saxon Alfred when, wandering alone,
crownless and sceptreless, he stretched himself on the lonely moor
beneath the shadow of thy golden blossoms, sighing for the fair queen he
had left far behind? When he bowed his kingly head, and, musing on thy
beauty, buried in a solitary wild, thought how even regal dignity would
be enhanced by humility, and that, although thou didst grow there
unmarked and unpruned, not a more princely flower waved in his own
English garden.

VERVAIN.... _Enchantment_.


Vervain was employed by the ancients in various kinds of divinations.
They ascribed to it a thousand properties, and, among others, that of
reconciling enemies. Whenever the Romans sent their heralds to offer
peace or war to nations, one of them always carried a sprig of Vervain.
The Druids, both in Gaul and Britain, regarded the Vervain with the same
veneration as the misletoe, and offered sacrifices to the earth before
they cut this plant in spring, which was a ceremony of great pomp.
Though the Druids and their religion have passed away, the Vervain is
still the plant of spells and enchantment. In the northern provinces of
France, the shepherds gather it with ceremonies and words known only to
themselves, and express its juices under certain phases of the moon.
They insist that this plant enables them to cure their ailments, and to
cast a spell on their daughters and cattle, by which they can make them
conform to their wishes.

CORN.... _Riches_.


Ceres, the goddess of Corn and harvest, was represented with a garland
of ears of Corn on her head. The commemoration of the loss of her
daughter Proserpine, was celebrated about the beginning of harvest; that
of her search after her, at the time of sowing Corn. A whole straw has
been made the emblem of union; and a broken straw, of rupture. The
custom of breaking a straw, to express the rupture of a contract, may be
traced back to an early period of French history, and may be said to
have had a royal origin. When Charles the Simple, of France, was
abandoned by his principal lords, they broke a straw to express that
they would no longer acknowledge him as their king. Corn may be regarded
as an appropriate emblem of wealth; since, wherever it grows, it leads
us to infer plenty and comfort.

CRANBERRY.... _Cure for the Heartache_.


    Far away among the hills,
      Far from tower and town,
    Where wide moors and heaths lie spread,
      Desolate and brown.

    Where the grouse and plover live
      Far from gun and dog,
    A delicate and tiny flower
      Decks swamp and watery bog.

    The Cranberry blossom dwelleth there
      Amid the mountains cold,
    Seeming like a fairy gift
      Left on the dreary wold.

    Oh! and ’tis very beautiful,
      The flowers are pink and white,
    And the small oval polished leaves
      Are evergreen and bright.

    ’Tis such a wee, fair, dainty thing,
      You’d think a greenhouse warm
    Would be its proper dwelling-place,
      Kept close from wind and storm.

    But on the moors it dwelleth free,
      Like a fearless mountain child;
    With a rosy cheek, a lightsome look,
      And a spirit strong and wild.

    In autumn, all among the swamps
      And marshes soft and wet,
    Come troops of poor hill-children
      The ripened fruit to get.

    The bushes all in water grow,
      In those small pools, that lie
    In scores among the turfy knolls
      On mountains broad and high.

    And there the peasant children come
      To pull the Cranberries red,
    Where bold and booted sporting squires
      Would scarcely dare to tread.

    _They_ only shoot the poor wild birds,
      And chase the timid hare,
    For their diversion; _they_ can live
      In luxury, without care.

    But these poor peasant-children’s lot
      Is full of human wo,
    And hungry, thinly clad, and cold,
      They o’er the mountains go;

    With feet, that shoes have never known,
      And legs all blue and bare,
    And yet, so light are they of heart,
      You’ll hear them laughing there.

    Such laughter makes my very heart
      Leap up with joy to hear,
    It tells that even poverty
      Is not entirely drear.

    It telleth--what I ever think,
      That GOD is good indeed;
    And that he suiteth, in us all,
      Our spirit to our need.

    Think ye--if these poor peasants were
      All discontent and sour--
    If they in frowns and murmurings
      Spent every wretched hour:--

    Like many a cherished, pampered child,
      Whom wealth and fondness cloy,
    Till e’en the knowledge of a want
      Would be a novel joy:--

    Think, if these peasants pined like him
      For pleasures they have not,
    How manifold would then have been
      The sorrows of their lot!

    But they, unshod, bareheaded too,
      Fed sparsely with coarse food,
    Go laughing on their gleesome way,
      As GOD’S bright creatures should.

    They are like flowers, springing up
      In some unkindly place,
    Yet full of all their colours rare,
      Their sweetness and their grace.

    They _are_ bright flowers, that spring to cheer
      E’en penury’s wilderness,
    And often with a swelling heart,
      Those human flowers I bless.

    Kind blessings on their bold, clear eyes,
      And elvish, unbound hair;--
    And blessings on their laughter wild,
      Mid crags and moorlands bare!

    In autumn mornings forth they go
      With baskets to the wold,
    Some of wicker, some of rush,
      Some new, and many old.

    And over mountain, over glen,
      The merry creatures bound,
    On to the wide and boggy heaths,
      Where a thousand streamlets sound.

    The small bare legs all splash about,
      Heeding not cold nor wet,
    So long as busy eyes can see,
      And hands the treasure get.

    “_And after all this toil and moil,
      What profit win they thence?_”--
    Perhaps a long day’s work may bring
      A few poor sordid pence.

    But more than hundreds to the rich
      Are pennies to the poor,
    And thankfully they seek and sell
      The Cranberries on the moor.

IVY.... _Constancy._


In Greece the altar of Hymen was enwreathed with Ivy, and a branch of it
was presented to the new-married couple, as a symbol of the indissoluble
knot. It was sacred to Bacchus, who is represented crowned with Ivy
leaves, as well as those of the vine. It formed the crown of the Greek
and Roman poets; and, in modern times, has been made the poet’s frequent
image of constancy. The Ivy is attached to the earth by its own roots,
and derives no nourishment from the substances to which it clings. The
protector of ruins, it adorns the dilapidated walls which it holds
together; it will not accept every kind of support, but its attachment
ends only with its life.

HOLLY.... _Foresight_.


The Holly, with its scarlet berries, is the most beautiful of the
evergreens that have been used for ages to adorn the churches of old
England, during the Christmas season. It is an ornament to the woods,
stripped bare by the rude breath of winter; its berries serve for food
for the little birds that never leave us, and its foliage affords them
an hospitable shelter during the cold season. Nature, by a seeming
forethought, has been careful to preserve the verdure of this handsome
tree all the year round, and to arm it with thorns, that it may furnish
both food and protection to the innocent creatures which resort to it
for shelter. It may be added, however, that from the bark of the common
Holly, when fermented and washed from the woody fibres, is made the
bird-lime which is used for catching small birds.

    O Reader! hast thou ever stood to see

          Its glossy leaves,

    No grazing cattle, through their prickly round

MEADOW SAFFRON.... _My best days are past_.

The Meadow Saffron, or Colchicum Autumnale, springs up about the time
the leaves begin to fall from the trees, and may, therefore, be said to
proclaim to all nature, that the bright days of summer are past.
According to Ovid, this autumnal flower owes its origin to some drops of
the magic liquor prepared by Medea, to restore the aged Æson to the
bloom and vigour of youth, which were spilled in the fields. As a
medicine, the Colchicum is powerful, but dangerous, and must be used
with caution. The poisonous quality of the plant seems to be known, as
if by instinct, to all kinds of cattle. They all shun it, and in many
pastures this alone will be found standing, when all other herbage has
been consumed.

      Well--I shall sit with aged men,
    And my good glass will tell me how
      A grisly beard becomes me then.
    And should no foul dishonour lie

    Love yet may search my fading eye,

CHINA ASTER.... _Variety_.


The China Aster begins to blow when other flowers are scarce. It is like
an afterthought of Flora’s, who smiles at leaving us. The China Aster
was introduced into Europe by Father d’Insarville, a Jesuit missionary;
who, about the year 1730, sent seeds of it to the royal gardens of
Paris. As, by cultivation, many varieties of the Aster have been
obtained, the flower has been made the emblem of variety.

they burned its berries during funerals to ban malign influences. In
some parts of Europe, the peasant still believes that the perfume of
Juniper berries purifies the air, and drives evil spirits from his
humble cot. The Juniper is made to signify protection, on account of the
defensive qualities ascribed to it by superstition, and the shelter its
drooping branches afford to small animals which are hard pressed by the
hunters.

HAZEL.... _Peace--Reconciliation_.


Fable gives the following account of the origin of the signification of
the Hazel. There was a time when men were at constant war with each
other, and could not be restrained from cruelty and revenge by any tie
of kin. The gods at length took pity on them. Apollo and Mercury made
presents to each other, and descended to the earth. The god of harmony
received from the son of Maia the shell of a tortoise, out of which he
had constructed a lyre, and gave him in exchange a Hazel stick, which
had the power of imparting a love of virtue and of reconciling hearts
divided by envy and hate. By the power thus given him, Mercury taught
men the love of peace, and of home and country, and made commerce the
bond of nations. Adorned with two light wings, and entwined with
serpents, the Hazel rod given to the god of eloquence by the god of
harmony is still, by the name of caduceus, the emblem of peace,
commerce, and reconciliation.

LIFE OF AN OAK TREE.

    Long centuries have come and passed
      Since, in a stormy wind,
    An acorn fell one autumn day,
      Like thousands of his kind.

    The wild swine fed in the forests then,
      And hungry beasts were they;
    They crunched the mast where’er it fell,
      And they feasted well that day.

    But as they trampled all about
      With heavy hoofs, they trod
    That acorn--perchance hundreds more--
      Deep in the yielding sod.

    Years came and went.--The acorn grew
      And became a young Oak tree;
    With a slender, straight, and flexile stem,
      Dressed in rich greenery.

    Time passeth on.--The young tree rose
      A bold and noble thing;
    Each summer showed a leafier crest,
      And a longer shoot each spring.

    There came into the ancient wood
      Some stern official men;
    They marked the fairest, loftiest trees,
      And they were doomèd then.

    They glanced upon the tall young Oak,
      And quickly passed it by,
    And laughing harshly, said ’twould do
      By the next century.

    Soon through the forest’s solemn glades
      There rang that deathful sound,
    The woodman’s axe;--and crashing fell
      Trunks, branches, all around.

    Craftsmen of many kinds there came
      For that oak timber good,
    And carried it in loads away
      From its old native wood.

    Some floated far o’er ocean’s waves
      Mid stormy winds and squalls,
    Both merchant-ships, and men-of-war,
      “Old England’s Wooden Walls.”

    Some, raised on high, with rare device
      The royal roof support,
    And look down in the banquet-hall
      On king, and queen, and court.

    Some, quaintly carved, and polished fair,
      May shrine a pictured face,
    Of Dolci’s gentle loveliness,
      Or Raphael’s angel grace.

    And many a toilet mirror owes,
      Its flowered and gilded frame
    To the good trees of which I sing:--
      Well have they won their fame!

    And massive tables, that have once
      Groaned ’neath baronial fare,
    If they could talk of that Oak wood,
      Might tell of dwelling there.--

    The young Oak tree yet statelier grew,
      And broader spread its shade,
    And the dappled deer lay sheltered ’neath
      The canopy it made.

    Years came and went.--The Oak tree stood
      In full-grown prime and pride,
    And lords of various mind and mood
      Possessed those woodlands wide.

    The first, a reckless forester,
      Loved horse, and hawk, and hound,
    And he chased all o’er his wide domains,
      Wellnigh the whole year round.

    His lady fair, as dames were wont,
      In those long bygone days,
    Loved hawking too; and gallant trains
      She led through forest ways.

    ’Twas a merry and a winsome thing,
      When lord, and squire, and knight
    Rode forth, mid bugles ringing shrill,
      With dainty ladies bright,
    To sweep along by vale and hill,
      Or through the forest glade,
    Where the echoes of their laughter light
      A merry music made.

    And oft they reined their palfreys in
      Beneath the young Oak tree,
    And oft foretold how grand a thing
      In after-time ’twould be.

    These jocund sports passed all away;
      For direful civil war
    Spread its fell curse throughout the land,
      Wasting it near and far.

    And the next lord these broad lands had,
      A warrior stern was he,
    He dwelt with camps and cannon more
      Than sylvan glade and tree.

    He died in battle; and his lands
      By craft and deeds unfair,
    His brother claimed and won, although
      His infant son was heir.

    This hard, bad man was miserly,
      And loved no thing save gold;
    He soon marked out the stately tree,
      To be cut down and sold.

    What was its beauty unto him?--
      The grand and noble thing!
    His dull eyes only measured well
      What moneys it would bring.

    But while he doomed the lordly oak,
      His wicked life ebbed low,
    And suddenly, death summoned him
      From his ill-got hoards to go.

    The grand estate--the ancient hall,
      The woods, and wealth untold,
    Came then unto that warrior’s child,
      A boy of ten years old.

    He was a thoughtful, quiet boy,
      For though yet young in years,
    His mother’s sorrows and his own
      Had made him old in tears.

    And with a calm and gentle joy
      Came home that youthful heir,
    For his chief source of gladness was,
      To bring his mother there:--

    To watch her sadly smile to see
      Again each well-known spot,
    Where days of happiness had passed,
      That ne’er could be forgot:--

    To have her former state restored,
      Maidens, and serving-men;
    And garments, richer than of old,
      He bade them bring her then.

    The gardens, that the miser had
      Left all untrimmed and bare,
    Were planted, pruned, and decked anew,
      And stored with all things rare.

    But chiefly did the lady love
      One glade within the wood,
    The shady glade, where broad and high,
      The noble Oak tree stood.

    Sad memories, yet sweet ones too,
      For her that lone spot bore:
    ’Twas there she parted from her lord
      To meet on earth no more!

    ’Twas there, beneath that tree, he spoke
      His last, _last_ fond farewell!
    From thence she watched him ride away
      The eve before he fell:--
    No marvel that sad lady loved
      The silent spot so well!

    And there they oft together came,
      The lady and the boy,
    For he to her was all on earth,
      Her one sole living joy.

    And long years after, when she slept
      Her warrior’s tomb beside,
    When the boy had grown an aged man,
      With grandsons by his side:--

    That ancient wood he reverenced;
      And peasants, when they spoke
    Of the old tree within the glade,
      Called it--the Lady’s Oak.

    I know the spot--though strangely time
      Hath altered all around,
    Where once the forest’s stillness lay,
      Now whirling wheels resound.

    A large and busy peopled town
      E’en on that spot we see,
    Where dappled deer and timid birds
      Dwelt fearlessly and free.

    But I remember when a child,
      One old and mouldering shell
    Of a most ancient, huge Oak tree
      Stood near the public well.

    I’ve sat within it many a time,
      In childish sport and play,
    And much I mourned to see at last
      The trunk quite cleared away.

    Soon they built there a fine new street,
      And noisy coaches sweep
    With roar and riot,--even where
      That lady came to weep!

    Each passing year we note a change
      In ancient things and new;
    And if we see so much in one,
      What may not hundreds do?

YEW.... _Sorrow_.


The Yew is among all nations an emblem of sorrow. Its bare trunk, and
dark foliage, with which its fruit, looking like drops of blood, stands
in harsh contrast, excite in us a sort of aversion. Persons who sleep
under a Yew tree are liable to be seized with dizziness, heaviness, and
violent headache. Its juice is poisonous, and the tree exhausts the soil
which supports it, and destroys all other plants which spring up beneath
it. The Yew was planted in old English burying-grounds, and its wood was
commonly employed for making bows and arrows before the introduction of
fire-arms. The Greeks, impressed with the melancholy aspect of this
tree, invented the fable of the unhappy Smilax; who, seeing that her
love was rejected by young Crocus, was transformed into a Yew.

MISTLETOE.... _I climb to greatness_.


The Mistletoe is a creeping plant which grows on the tops of the tallest
trees. The proud oak is its slave, and nourishes it with his own
substance. The Druids paid a kind of adoration to it, as the emblem of a
weakness that was superior to strength: they regarded the tyrant of the
oak as equally formidable to men and gods.

GRASS.... _Submission_.


According to the Greek historians, Grass was made the symbol of
submission, because the ancient nations of the West gathered Grass and
presented it to the conqueror, to show that they confessed themselves
overcome. The grass is trodden under foot by imperial man; and, instead
of returning to its former vigour with elastic spring, or punishing its
violator like the nettle, yields to its fate--spiritless submission.

    How warmly we are loved, we seldom learn
      Till pain and sorrow take our strength away;
    Then hearts too long estranged, to us will turn,
      And be at peace, as in a former day.
    Our true and loving wife more loving grows;
      Our little ones in pitying wonder stand
      Beside the bed and clasp our fevered hand;
    Their glistening eye the tear of feeling shows;
      And it may be, when evening calls to rest,
    They sadly kneel beside their mother’s chair,
    Their silvery voices blend in simple prayer,
      And for their sire they make a child’s request.
    The times of anguish vainly are not given.
    That lead a family to unity and heaven.

    Yes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,
    These simple blessings of the lowly train,
    To me more dear, congenial to my heart,

    Spontaneous joys, where nature has its play,
    The soul adopts, and owns their first-born sway;
    Lightly they frolic o’er the vacant mind,

    With all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed,
    In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,

    There was a poet whose untimely tomb
    No human hands with pious reverence reared,
    But the charmed eddies of autumnal winds
    Built o’er his mouldering bones a pyramid

    A lovely youth!--no mourning maiden decked
    With weeping flowers, or votive cypress wreath,
    The lone couch of his everlasting sleep:
    Gentle and brave, and generous, no lorn bard
    Breathed o’er his dark fate one melodious sigh:
    He lived, he died, he sang, in solitude.
    Strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes,
    And virgins, as unknown he past, have sighed
    And wasted for fond love of his wild eyes.
    The fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn,
    And Silence, too, enamoured of that voice,
    Locks its mute music in her rugged cell.

DEATH OF THE FLOWERS.


    The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year,
    Of wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown and sere.
    Heaped in the hollow of the grove, the withered leaves lie dead;
    They rustle to the eddying gust and to the rabbit’s tread.
    The robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrub the jay,
    And from the wood-top calls the crow, through all the gloomy day.
    Where are the flowers, the young fair flowers, that lately sprang and stood,
    In brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood?
    Alas! they all are in their graves; the gentle race of flowers
    Are lying in their lonely beds, with the fair and good of ours.
    The rain is falling where they lie: but the cold November rain
    Calls not, from out the gloomy earth, the lovely ones again.
    The wind-flower and the violet, they perished long ago,
    And the wild-rose and the orchis died, amid the summer glow;
    But on the hill the golden-rod, and the aster in the wood,
    And the yellow sunflower by the brook, in autumn beauty stood,
    Till fell the frost from the clear cold heaven, as falls the plague on men,
    And the brightness of their smile was gone, from upland, glade, and glen.
    And now, when comes the calm mild day, as still such days will come,
    To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home;
    When the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still,
    And twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill,
    The south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he bore,
    And sighs to find them in the wood and by the streams no more.
    And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died,
    The fair meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side:
    In the cold moist earth we laid her, when the forest cast the leaf,
    And we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief:
    Yet not unmeet it was that one, like that young friend of ours,
    So gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers.

The Dial of Flowers.


    ’Twas a lovely thought to mark the hours,
      As they floated in light away,
    By the opening and the folding flowers
      That laugh to the summer’s day.

    Thus had each moment its own rich hue,
      And its graceful cup and bell,
    In whose coloured vase might sleep the dew,
      Like a pearl in an ocean shell.

    To such sweet signs might the time have flowed,
      In a golden current on,
    Ere from the garden, man’s first abode,
      The glorious guests were gone.

    So might the days have been brightly told--
      Those days of song and dreams--
    When shepherds gathered their flocks of old
      By the blue Arcadian streams;
    So, in those isles of delight, that rest
      Far off in a breezeless main,
    Which many a bark with a weary guest
      Has sought, but still in vain.

    Yet is not life, in its real flight,
      Marked thus--even thus--on earth,
    By the closing of one hope’s delight,
      And another’s gentle birth?

    Oh! let us live so that, flower by flower,
      Shutting in turn, may leave
    A lingerer still for the sunset hour,
      A charm for the shaded eve!

    _Hemans._

When a plant is approaching its state of perfection, when its organs of
nourishment are completely developed, and its vegetation is most
luxuriant, then arrives the time of flowering, which has been aptly
termed “the joy of plants.” The most superficial observer must have
noticed how different is the season of flowering of individual plants,
and how each month is adorned with its particular flowers. When the
intense cold of January confines us to our houses, the Black Hellebore,
or Christmas Rose, unfolds its dazzling white blossoms; in February, the
innocent Snowdrop presents to us her elegant cup. In the same month the
Hazel puts forth its catkins, and not rarely the early-blooming Crowfoot
shows the blue tips of its clusters of blossom. March boasts a richer
Flora; then the Violet delights us with its fragrance; the Mezereon
offers its peach-coloured flowers, and the Primrose leads on a long
train of the charming children of Spring. These now continue to advance
in increasing numbers, displaying, especially in May and June, their
highest splendour; till at length the Meadow Saffron takes leave of
inclement Autumn, and, saturated with rain, the Mosses acquire fresh
vigour, and open to the botanist a new field for investigation.

Not less different than the period of flowering is the time of the
opening and shutting of flowers. Some plants habitually open and close
their flowers by turns; others are governed in these respects by the
weather; others again, by the length or shortness of the day: while some
open and shut at certain hours, and thus furnish materials for composing
the Dial of Flowers.

According to the observations of later botanists, the flowery crown of
plants serves, among other things, to envelop the tender organs of
fructification, and to protect them from the pernicious influence of
external agents. Those organs of fructification are the chief objects of
the maternal care of Nature; while shut up in the flower-bud, they
acquire that strength and perfection of parts which enable them to
endure the light of the sun, and to perform the functions for which they
are designed. It is not till they are capable of fulfilling these
functions that the flower unfolds itself; but it again closes at such
times when external influences might be injurious to the delicate organs
of fructification. Many flowers can bear only the refreshing morning air
and the first rays of the sun, but remain shut all the rest of the day.
This may be particularly observed in the different species of
Convolvulus, Ipomæa, and Goat’s Beard. We find these, in general, open
only till about eleven o’clock. In like manner, the Mallows and the
Mesembryanthemums unfold their flowers about noon: and precisely at that
time, in serene weather, open the singularly-formed Drosera, and the
common Purslain, which shut again in an hour. Others unfold themselves
only in the evening, and continue open all night, probably because their
delicate organs would be injured by the sun. The Œnotheras, the Gauras,
and the different species of the Mirabilis, furnish examples of this
kind. Thus, too, the Cactus opuntia opens its magnificent blossoms at
night only, and towards morning shuts them up for ever. The flowers of
many plants of the nineteenth class are observed to hang their heads
during night--the Camellia, for example--by which means the rain, or
dew, which might injure the tender organs of fructification, can run off
the more easily. In other plants of this class, the flower shuts up
against rain, and on the approach of evening, as is the case with the
Marigolds.

The periodical change of colour in some flowers is also worthy of
remark. Thus, the flowers of the speckled French Honeysuckle (_Hedysarum
maculatum_) are purple in the morning and green at noon. The changeable
Hibiscus (_Hibiscus mutabilis_) is white in the morning, flesh-coloured
at noon, and rose-red in the evening. Thus, too, the great Corn-flag
(_Gladiolus grandis_) changes its colour several times in the course of
the day.

Neither is the scent of flowers equally strong and agreeable at all
hours of the day: many, even of our indigenous flowers, have the
strongest scent at night. The _Ixia cinnamomea_ gives out its fragrance
in the evening only; the highly-scented Lesser Orpine (_Crassula
odoratissima_) only in the night; the _Epidendrum fragrans_, morning and
evening; another species of Epidendrum, hung up in a room, without earth
or water, yields an agreeable perfume for years. The flowers of the
_Hebenstreitia dentata_ are scentless in the morning, have a
disagreeable smell at noon, and give out in the evening a fragrant
odour, not unlike that of the Hyacinth.

These properties of flowers, and the opening and shutting of many at
particular times of the day, led to the idea of planting them in such a
manner as to indicate the succession of the hours, and to make them
supply the place of a watch or clock. Those who are disposed to try the
experiment may easily compose such a dial by consulting the following
table, comprehending the hours between three in the morning and eight in
the evening.

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project

Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
