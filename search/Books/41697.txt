ANALYSES FOR...PHYSICIANS

By the Analytic Laboratories of Merck & Co. New York

_Examinations of Water, Milk, Blood, Urine, Sputum, Pus, Food
Products, Beverages, Drugs, Minerals, Coloring Matters, etc., for
diagnostic, prophylactic, or other scientific purposes._

All analyses at these Laboratories are so conducted as to assure the
best service attainable on the basis of the latest scientific
developments. The laboratories are amply supplied with a perfect
quality of reagent materials, and with the most efficient constructions
of modern apparatus and instruments. The probable cost for some of the
most frequently needed researches is approximately indicated below:

    Sputum, for tuberculosis bacilli,                         $3.00
    Urine, for tuberculosis bacilli,                           3.00
    Milk, for tuberculosis bacilli,                            3.00
    Urine, qualitative, for one constituent,                   1.50
    Urine, qualitative, for each additional constituent,       1.00
    Urine, quantitative, for each constituent,                 3.00
    Urine, sediment, microscopical,                            1.50
    Blood, for ratio of white to red corpuscles,               2.00
    Blood, for Widal's typhoid reaction,                       2.00
    Water, for general fitness to drink,                      10.00
    Water, for typhoid germs,                                 25.00
    Water, quantitative determination of any one constituent, 10.00
    Pus, for gonococci,                                        3.00

The cost for other analyses--more variable in scope--can only be given
upon closer knowledge of the requirements of individual cases.

All pharmacists in every part of the United States will receive and
transmit orders for the MERCK ANALYTIC LABORATORIES.


_Physicians are earnestly requested to communicate to Merck & Co.,
University Place, New York, any suggestions that may tend to improve
this book for its Second Edition, which will soon be in course of
preparation._

_Whatever the Publishers can do to make Merck's Manual of still greater
service to the Medical Profession will be gladly undertaken and
promptly performed for all subsequent editions._

_Therefore, any Physician who will propose improvements in the
subject-matter (especially as regards the Newer Materia Medica), or in
the arrangement, style, and form of this work, for future editions,
will thus be rendering valuable service, not only to its Publishers,
but to the entire Profession as well!_

MERCK'S MANUAL is designed to meet a need which every general
practitioner has often experienced. Memory is treacherous. It is
particularly so with those who have much to do and more to think of.
When the best remedy is wanted, to meet indications in cases that are a
little out of the usual run, it is difficult, and sometimes impossible,
to recall the whole array of available remedies so as to pick out the
best. Strange to say, too, it is the most thoroughly informed man that
is likely to suffer to the greatest extent in this way; because of the
very fact that his mind is overburdened. But a mere reminder is all he
needs, to make him at once master of the situation and enable him to
prescribe exactly what his judgment tells him is needed for the
occasion.

In MERCK'S MANUAL the physician will find a complete Ready-Reference
Book covering the entire eligible Materia Medica. A glance over it just
before or just after seeing a patient will refresh his memory in a way
that will facilitate his coming to a decision. In this book, small as
it is, he will find the essential data found in the ponderous
Dispensatories, together with the facts of newest record, which can
appear only in future editions of those works.

Part I affords at a glance a descriptive survey, in one alphabetic
series, of the entire Materia Medica to-day in general use by the
American profession. Part II contains a summary of Therapeutic
Indications for the employment of remedies, arranged according to
the Pathologic Conditions to be combated. Part III presents a
Classification of Medicaments in accordance with their Physiologic
Actions.


The publishers may be allowed to state that they have labored long and
earnestly, so to shape this little volume that it shall prove a firm
and faithful help to the practitioner in his daily round of duty. They
now send it forth in the confident hope that, the more it is put to the
test of actual use, the more it will grow in the esteem of its
possessor.




CONTENTS.


~Pages 9 to 82.~

~Part First.--THE MATERIA MEDICA, as in actual use to-day by American
Physicians.~ (Alphabetically arranged.)

THIS PART EMBRACES all those Simple Medicinal Substances (that
is, drugs and chemicals) which are in current and well-established use
in the medical practice of this country; or which, if too recently
introduced to be as yet in general use, are vouched for by eminent
authorities in medical science;--also, the medicinally employed
Pharmaceutic Preparations recognized by the United States
Pharmacopoeia.

    (Added thereto, for the convenience of those practitioners who
    prescribe them, are Medicamentous Mixtures advertised only to the
    Profession, but whose composition or mode of manufacture has not
    been made known with sufficient completeness or exactness to
    satisfy all members of the Profession. In the selection the
    publishers have been guided solely by the recognition accorded the
    various preparations by the Profession, according to the best
    information obtained.)

There has also been included, under the title of "Foods and Dietetic
Preparations," a list of such preparations as are frequently prescribed
for infants' diet, or for the sick or convalescent.

OMITTED from the Materia Medica chapter are: Medicaments that
have become obsolete, or that are too rarely used to be of general
interest; and such new remedies as are not yet safely accredited on
reliable authority; also those galenic preparations (syrups, extracts,
pills, essences, elixirs, wines, emulsions, etc.) which are not
standardized according to the U.S. Pharmacopoeia; likewise all
articles that are put up and advertised for self-medication by the
lay public.

SEPARATE TITLES in the alphabetic series are accorded, as a rule,
to the botanical drugs and other pharmaceutical mother-substances,
to proximate principles (alkaloids, glucosides, organic acids, etc.),
and to chemical compounds (salts, "synthetics," etc.); while the
official galenic preparations, solutions and dilutions, derived
from them, are mostly mentioned under the titles of their respective
mother-substances. (Thus, for instance, "Dover's Powder" will be
found under "Opium," while "Morphine" is described under its own
title.)

    (_Smaller type_ has been employed--in order to economize
    space--for botanic drugs, gums, and some others of the older drugs
    and preparations which are so long and well known that but little
    reference will need be made to them.)

    (Those substances of the Materia Medica which can be had of the
    MERCK brand are--for the convenience of prescribers--so
    designated).

~Part Second.--THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS for the use of the Materia
Medica and other agents.~ (Arranged alphabetically under the titles
of the various Pathologic Conditions.)

THIS PART SUMMARIZES in brief form, the principal means of
treatment for each form of disease, as reported to be in good use with
practitioners at the present time. The statements hereon are drawn from
the standard works of the leading modern writers on Therapeutics, and
supplemented--in the case of definite chemicals of more recent
introduction--by the reports of reputable clinical investigators.

are already given in "PART I," as to the modes of action of
the various medicaments.

_~When in immediate need~_

of Drugs or Chemicals not at hand, any pharmacist is in a position to
use our EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, which is in operation every day in the
year, Sundays and Holidays included, until 9 p.m.--Hurry orders
reaching us after regular business hours will receive prompt
attention,--_provided_:

1--_that they come by_ WIRE;

2--_that they call for_ MERCK'S _chemicals or drugs_ (no other brands
being in stock with us);

3--_and that the quantity and nature of the goods admit of their being
sent through the_ MAILS.

As it is impossible for us to ascertain in each instance the identity
of a Physician who might wish to make use of this department, we must
insist (for the proper protection of the Profession against the
unauthorized purchase of poisons, etc.; as well as in due recognition,
by us, of the established usage in the traffic with medicines and
drugs) that every such order be transmitted through an established
Pharmacist; and pharmacists, when telegraphing orders to us, should
always mention their jobber to whom the article is to be charged.

We trust that this Department will prove of value in cases of emergency
and immediate need.

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
